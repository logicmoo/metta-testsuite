main
#
# the mettalog interpreter script uses the 
# first line of this file to decide witch subdir or src/ to 
# choices at the time of writing this:
#
# main - suggested for stable general use such as for those doing timing tests
#
# canary - bug fixes with short turn around times.  Most ideal for 
#          those who have submitting problems and want things working w/in
#          48 hours.
#
# development - Not to be confused with the branch of the same name
#               code being developed that does NOT pass the sanity tests
#               the moment it did it would have already been immediately 
#               integrated to canary!
#
# base - reference to last known working main
