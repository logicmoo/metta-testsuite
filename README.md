## Getting Started

### :gear: Installation

_Before you get started make sure `pip` and `venv` are working good._

Clone and set up MeTTaLog with the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/logicmoo/metta-testsuite
cd metta-testsuite
source ./INSTALL.sh # Follow the default prompts 
```
#### The INSTALL.sh script handles the installation of essential components and updates:
- Ensures Python's `pip` is installed or installs it.
- **Installs or Updates SWI-Prolog** to ensure version 9.3.9 or higher is present.
- **Installs janus**: A Python package that interfaces with SWI-Prolog.
- **Installs pyswip**: Another Python package that provides further integration.
- **Installs hyperon**: Hyperon pip package needed for running compatibility tests.
- **Installs ansi2html**: Unit Test Visibility.
- **Installs junit2html**: Unit Test Reporting.
- **Installs mettalog-vspace**: Allows Rust MeTTa use extra functionality found in mettalog.
- **Installs mettalog-jupyter-kernel**: Work with metta files in Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Installs metakernel**: (No relation!) but allows our Jupyter Kernel to work.

**Note**: Running this script modifies software configurations and installs packages. Ensure you're prepared for these changes.

## :whale: Running MeTTaLog with Docker

<details>
  <summary>This section guides you through using Docker to set up</summary>

Ensures that MeTTaLog is isolated from your local filesystem and operates in a controlled environment.

### Building the Docker Image

To create a Docker image with MeTTaLog installed, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t mettalog .
```

This command constructs a Docker image named `mettalog` based on the Dockerfile in the current directory.

### Interacting with MeTTaLog in Docker

After building the image, you can run MeTTaLog inside a Docker container. This isolates it from your local filesystem, which means it won't have direct access to your local files unless explicitly configured to do so.

To start an interactive container with a bash shell, use:

```bash
docker run -it mettalog bash -l
```

Once inside the container, you have several options to interact with MeTTaLog. See [Running MeTTaLog](#neckbeard-running-mettalog).

### Transferring Files to and from the Container

Docker allows you to copy files between the host and the container, which can be useful for moving scripts or data into the container before running them, or extracting results afterward. Refer to the Docker documentation on [copying files](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_cp/) for more details.

For comprehensive information about Docker's capabilities, consult the [Docker manuals](https://docs.docker.com/manuals/) and [reference documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/).

## :neckbeard: Running MeTTaLog

Interact directly with MeTTaLog through the REPL:
```bash
mettalog --repl

metta+> !(+ 1 1)
Deterministic: 2

; Execution took 0.000105 secs. (105.29 microseconds)
metta+>^D   # Exit the REPL with `ctrl-D`.
```

To run a script:
```bash
mettalog tests/baseline_compat/metta-morph_tests/nalifier.metta
```

To run a script and then enter the repl:
```bash
mettalog tests/baseline_compat/metta-morph_tests/nalifier.metta --repl
```

Execute a unit test:
```bash
# The output is saved as an HTML file in the same directory.
mettalog --test tests/baseline_compat/metta-morph_tests/tests0.metta 
```
Execute baseline sanity tests:
```bash
mettalog --test --clean ./tests/baseline_compat/
```

## :toolbox: Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>Some prolog commands not found</summary>

If you already have a recent enough version of SWI-Prolog installed, that will be used instead of mettalog installing its own. Some of the packages might not be installed, and mettalog might give an error such as:

```
ERROR: save_history/0: Unknown procedure el_write_history/2
```

In that case, you need to rebuild your SWI-Prolog installation to include the missing packages. The most reliable way to do this is to make sure the following Debian/Ubuntu packages are installed using:

```
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf git cmake libpython3-dev libgmp-dev libssl-dev unixodbc-dev \
        libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libarchive-dev libossp-uuid-dev libxext-dev \
        libice-dev libjpeg-dev libxinerama-dev libxft-dev libxpm-dev libxt-dev \
        pkg-config libdb-dev libpcre3-dev libyaml-dev libedit-dev
```

then rebuild SWI-Prolog using the instructions from the [SWI-Prolog -- Installation on Linux, *BSD (Unix)](https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/unix.html). The main part of this (assuming that you are in the `swipl` or `swipl-devel` directory) is:

```
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=PGO -G Ninja ..
ninja
ctest -j $(nproc) --output-on-failure
ninja install
```
If you installed SWI-Prolog as a package from your Linux distribution and run into issues, it is likely that you will need to `apt remove` it and then either
* build SWI-Prolog from source making sure that all the operating system packages are installed first, or
* rerun the metta-wam `INSTALL.sh` script.
