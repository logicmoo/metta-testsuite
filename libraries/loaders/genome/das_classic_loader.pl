 * Project: MeTTaLog - A MeTTa to Prolog Transpiler/Interpreter
 * Description: This file is part of the source code for a transpiler designed to convert
 *              MeTTa language programs into Prolog, utilizing the SWI-Prolog compiler for
 *              optimizing and transforming function/logic programs. It handles different
 *              logical constructs and performs conversions between functions and predicates.
