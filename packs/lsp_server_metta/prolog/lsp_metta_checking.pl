% lsp_metta_did_save_diagnostics.pl
%
% Purpose:
%
% A Prolog implementation of the `didSave` handler for the LSP server, which
% triggers diagnostics upon file save and replies with a `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`
% notification. This notification allows the editor or IDE to display errors, warnings,
% or other diagnostic information related to the saved document.
%
% How It Works:
% - Upon receiving a `didSave` notification, the system analyzes the document.
% - If issues are found (e.g., syntax errors, undefined symbols), a diagnostics list is created.
% - A `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` notification is sent back to the client with
%   the list of diagnostic issues found in the document.
