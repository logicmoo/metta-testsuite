%
% Purpose:
%
% A Prolog implementation of a documentFormattingProvider for Lisp code.
%
% This module formats Lisp code by ensuring consistent indentation and removing
% unnecessary whitespace. The formatting rules account for Lisp's syntax, including
% proper indentation for nested expressions and balanced parentheses.
%
% How It Works:
% - Reads the document text from the provided URI.
% - Splits the document into lines.
% - Applies MeTTa-specific formatting rules, such as:
%   - Consistent indentation for nested parentheses.
%   - Removing unnecessary trailing whitespace.
%   - Ensuring consistent line breaks between nested forms.
% - Returns a list of text edits to apply to the document.
