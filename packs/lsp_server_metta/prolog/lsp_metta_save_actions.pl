% Purpose:
%
% A Learning Experiment: Add a Date adding hook in `willSaveWaitUntil`
%
% This module mimics the behavior of CVS (Concurrent Versions System) by managing and
% updating a file header with a CVS-style date comment. Specifically, it updates or
% inserts a line at the top of each file with the format:
%
%   ; $Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS $
%
% This date comment records the last saved date and time of the file. When the file
% is about to be saved, the system checks the top of the file for this comment. If
% it is found, the date is updated. If not, a new comment with the current date and
% time is inserted at the top. This approach ensures that every file maintains a
% record of its most recent modification, in the same way that CVS used to maintain
% metadata in file headers.
%
% Key Responsibilities:
% - **CVS-Style Date Comment Management**: Tracks and updates a date comment formatted
%   as `; $Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS $` at the top of each file in the workspace.
% - **Date Update or Insertion**: On each save, the date comment is either updated
%   with the current date and time or added if it is not found.
% - **Integration with LSP**: This module hooks into the `textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil`
%   request in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to ensure that the date comment is
%   correctly updated before the file is saved.
%
% How It Works:
% - **Date Comment Detection**: When a file is saved, the module checks the first line
%   of the file for a valid CVS-style date comment. This comment must match the format
%   `; $Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS $`.
% - **Date Update**: If the comment is found, it is updated with the current date and
%   time.
% - **Date Insertion**: If the comment is not found, a new date comment is inserted at
%   the top of the file.
%
% Example:
% - Before saving:
%   ```
%   ; $Date: 2023-09-15 10:45:12 $
%   print("Hello, World!")
%   ```
%
% - After saving (with current date):
%   ```
%   ; $Date: 2024-10-01 12:34:56 $
%   print("Hello, World!")
%   ```
%
% Integration with LSP:
% - The module integrates with the LSP `willSaveWaitUntil` request, ensuring that the
%   date comment is updated or added just before the file is saved.
