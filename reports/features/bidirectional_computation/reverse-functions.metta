;; ### Discussion Points:
;; 1. **Is running functions backwards a feature we want to solidify in MeTTa?**
;; 2. **Does anyone believe that the current version of MeTTa can already handle such
;;    reverse executions efficiently?**
;; 3. **Or, is this approach deemed too ambitious or incongruent with MeTTa''s foundational
;;    principles?**
