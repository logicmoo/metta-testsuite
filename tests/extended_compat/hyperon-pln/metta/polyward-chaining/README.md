# Polyward Chaining Experiments

## Description

Polyward chaining is somewhere between forward/backward and omniward
chaining.  Unlike forward chaining, that goes only forward, or
backward chaining, that goes only backward, it may go in multiple
directions but, unlike omniward chaining, not necessarily in all
directions.

## Usage

To run the experiments, enter the following

```bash
metta pc-xp.metta
```

It should outputs empty results indicating that all tests have passed.
