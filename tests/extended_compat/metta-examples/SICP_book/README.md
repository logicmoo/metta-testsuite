# SICP examples
Exercises and examples from book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie Sussman. Book mainly focused on scheme but it was decided to try re-write examples and exercises from this book to Metta. Probably it will be helpful for those who are trying to learn Metta by examples.
