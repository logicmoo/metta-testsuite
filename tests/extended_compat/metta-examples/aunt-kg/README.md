# Aunt Knowledge Graph

An exploration in knowledge graphs, raised by
[https://github.com/trueagi-io/metta-examples/issues/40]()

The goal is to evaluate how expressive, intuitive, and performant MeTTa is for dealing with regular labeled graphs.


## Start here and Conceptual
True to the original issue we work with ancestral graphs.
The original hand-crafted graph is [toy_simple.metta]()
For more details, visit the issue link above.

## Data and conversion

Getting real-world data into MeTTa consists of several steps:
- Conversion from [GEDCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM) to JSON.  
You can use the following tool https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/delicate-haze-2zv77m (based on https://github.com/Jisco/gedcom.json).
- Conversion from JSON to MeTTa files.  
Using the Python script [json_to_metta.py]().
- Conversion from the genealogical data to the simplified statements.  
Using the MeTTa script [simple_conversion.metta]().

## Benchmarks

The benchmark is to do every query (parent, mother, sister, aunt, predecessor) for every person.
