# metta-amr sketches

The following folders
* amr_matching
* amr_processing
* amr_templates
* experiments
* metta_space
contain a preliminary version of AMR template matching in MeTTa. They may not fully work as the project is not being maintained right now.

metta_to_amr folder contains a pure MeTTa code showing a preliminary attempt of such knowledge representation in MeTTa, which is compatible with generating corresponding AMRs to be translated into natural language, as well as an example of using amrlib to produce an utterance from the generated amr graph.
