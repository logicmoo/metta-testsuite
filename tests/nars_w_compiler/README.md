# Project Name: Compiler Compatibility Test Suite

## Overview
This project focuses on maintaining and evolving a suite of tests designed to ensure the compatibility and functionality of our custom compiler development. The test suite is a critical component in our development process, aiding in the verification of new features, the detection of regressions, and the overall stability and compatibility of the compiler with existing codebases.

## Test Suite Evolution
As our compiler evolves, so too must our test suite. This evolution includes the addition of new tests to cover newly introduced language features or compiler directives, the modification of existing tests to align with updated language specifications or compiler behavior, and the removal of tests related to deprecated features or practices.

### Adding New Tests
- **Purpose**: Ensure new features or directives are fully supported and work as intended without causing regressions in existing functionality.
- **Process**: New tests are added following the introduction of new compiler features, directives, or significant changes to existing functionality.

### Modifying Existing Tests
- **Purpose**: Reflect changes in the compiler's behavior, updates to language standards, or optimizations that alter the expected outcomes of existing tests.
- **Process**: Existing tests are reviewed and updated as part of feature development or when changes to the compiler necessitate adjustments to ensure accuracy and relevance.

### Removing Tests
- **Purpose**: Keep the test suite current by removing tests that are no longer relevant due to the deprecation or removal of features or practices.
- **Process**: Tests related to deprecated features or practices are identified and removed to prevent confusion and to focus on the current and future state of the compiler.

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributors are encouraged to participate in the test suite's evolution by submitting pull requests with proposed test additions, modifications, or deletions. Contributions should be accompanied by a clear explanation of the rationale behind the changes, including references to relevant compiler changes or language updates.

Thank you for contributing to the stability and compatibility of our compiler. Your efforts help ensure that our tooling remains reliable and efficient for all users.
