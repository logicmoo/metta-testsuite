### **1.2 Observations**

#### **1. Transpiled MeTTaLog Performance**
- Transpiled MeTTaLog achieves **sub-second execution** for N ≤ 8, solving N=10 in **0.11 minutes (~6.6 seconds)** and N=12 in **0.415 minutes (~24.9 seconds)**.
- These times demonstrate its ability to narrow the performance gap with low-level implementations like C/C++.

#### **2. Interpreted vs. Transpiled MeTTaLog**
- Transpiled MeTTaLog is **2000x faster** than Interpreted MeTTaLog for larger N like N=10, transforming MeTTa into a practical option for real-world performance requirements.

#### **3. Plain Prolog vs. CLP(FD)**
- **CLP(FD) Faster for Small N:** 
  - CLP(FD) demonstrates better performance for smaller sizes (e.g., N=4 to N=10) due to its efficient domain pruning mechanisms.
- **Plain Prolog Faster for Larger N:**
  - Plain Prolog starts outperforming CLP(FD) for larger sizes (e.g., N ≥ 12). This is because Plain Prolog avoids the significant resource overhead of CLP(FD)’s constraint propagation system, which becomes a bottleneck as the problem scales.
- **Use Case Differentiation:**
  - CLP(FD) is ideal for **constraint-heavy, small-to-medium problems**, leveraging its declarative simplicity and built-in optimizations.
  - Plain Prolog is better suited for **general-purpose backtracking on large-scale problems** with simpler constraints.

#### **4. Comparison with C/C++**
- Transpiled MeTTaLog narrows the gap but is still outperformed by C/C++ for all N, where execution remains in the sub-second range.

## **2. Integrating Prolog Features into MeTTa**

To maximize efficiency, MeTTa could integrate the following features inspired by Prolog:

1. **Domain-Specific Constraints:**
   ```metta
   (domain X 1..N)
   ```

2. **Common Constraints:**
   ```metta
   (all_different [X Y Z])
   ```

3. **Arithmetic Constraints:**
   ```metta
   (= (+ X Y) Z)
   ```

4. **Transpilation to Prolog:**
   - Enable seamless transpilation to Prolog or CLP(FD) for performance-critical tasks.

---

## **3. Conclusion**

The updated dataset reaffirms that **Transpiled MeTTaLog** offers dramatic performance improvements, making MeTTa competitive with Prolog and approaching the efficiency of low-level languages for some problem sizes. By integrating Prolog-like features and supporting transpilation, MeTTa can combine the flexibility of symbolic reasoning with real-world performance, enhancing its viability for both research and application.

Additionally, **Plain Prolog’s scalability for larger N** highlights its relevance for solving large-scale problems efficiently. In contrast, **CLP(FD)** remains a better choice for smaller, constraint-heavy tasks.
