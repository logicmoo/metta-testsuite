### **2.2 Observations**

#### **Interpreted vs. Transpiled MeTTaLog**
- Transpiled MeTTaLog achieves **sub-second execution** for N â‰¤ 8, solving N=10 in **0.11 minutes (~6.6 seconds)** and N=12 in **0.415 minutes (~24.9 seconds)**.
- Transpiled MeTTaLog is **2000x faster** than Interpreted MeTTaLog for larger N like N=10, transforming MeTTa into a practical option for real-world performance requirements.

#### **Plain Prolog vs. CLP(FD)**
- **Plain Prolog Advantages:**
  - **Better Scalability for Large N:** Plain Prolog avoids the resource-intensive domain propagation machinery of CLP(FD), enabling it to scale better for very large problem sizes (e.g., N > 12).
  - **Simplicity:** The backtracking mechanism of Plain Prolog is lightweight and effective for problems where constraints are straightforward and don't require advanced pruning.
  - **Lower Overhead:** For smaller constraints or less complex domains, Plain Prolog executes faster by sidestepping the computational overhead introduced by CLP(FD).
  
- **CLP(FD) Advantages:**
  - **Optimized for Small to Medium N:** CLP(FD) is highly efficient for small-to-medium problem sizes due to its domain pruning and constraint satisfaction features.
  - **Declarative Simplicity:** By using built-in constructs like `all_different` and `ins`, CLP(FD) makes expressing constraints easier and more readable.

- **When to Use Which:**
  - **Plain Prolog** is preferable for larger N or when stack constraints are a concern.
  - **CLP(FD)** is ideal for constraint-heavy problems with smaller solution spaces or when domain-specific pruning can significantly reduce search time.

#### **Comparison with C/C++**
- Transpiled MeTTaLog narrows the gap but is still outperformed by C/C++ for all N, where execution remains in the sub-second range.

## **3. Integrating Prolog Features into MeTTa**

To maximize efficiency, MeTTa could integrate the following features inspired by Prolog:

1. **Domain-Specific Constraints:**
   ```metta
   (domain X 1..N)
   ```

2. **Common Constraints:**
   ```metta
   (all_different [X Y Z])
   ```

3. **Arithmetic Constraints:**
   ```metta
   (= (+ X Y) Z)
   ```

4. **Transpilation to Prolog:**
   - Enable seamless transpilation to Prolog or CLP(FD).

## **4. Conclusion**

The updated dataset reaffirms that **Transpiled MeTTaLog** offers dramatic performance improvements, making MeTTa competitive with Prolog and approaching the efficiency of low-level languages for some problem sizes. By integrating Prolog-like features and supporting transpilation, MeTTa can combine the flexibility of symbolic reasoning with real-world performance, enhancing its viability for both research and application.
