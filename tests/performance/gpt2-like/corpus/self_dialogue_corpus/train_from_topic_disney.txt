How many Disney movies have you actually seen?
I have seen many movies. But recently, Moana is one of my favorites.
Visually, Moana is a gorgeous film.
Yes of course. Moana flat-out wowed me, from its music, to its story and characters, to its sheer visual spectacle.
The whole team did the animation work very well. Graphics are engaging and the story line is superb.
Hundred percent agree with you.
The lead character Moana draws you into the movie with her charming attitude.
The movie does not bore you for single minute.
Many kids likes this movie.
Overall, Moana was definitely an amazing Disney classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like older Disney films.
Yes. You never knew what was gonna happen
Now they all follow a certain pattern
Yeah. it seems to be a bit lazy
Dumbo had a great story and you did not know what would happen next
I agree, I had no idea how it would turn out
I like the Disney films where they follow a character on a journey
I agree. The Little Mermaid is a good example of that.
Yes it is.
She has a goal and then a bunch of thing happen to her and we do not know what will happen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Toy Story movie?
I like the first one.
Why is that?
The relationship between Buzz and Woody is deep.
Yeah, there was a lot of growth in that one.
The second and third ones are great. But, the first one is amazing.
I agree. It has everything.
Pixar did a great job with that movie.
Do you think the 4th one will be good?
Yes, I do. Pixar is awesome at telling stories.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've just realised that despite there being dozens of Disney films, they're all set in London.
Well that's just not true.
OK then name one that isn't.
Dumbo is set in Africa.
That's just one exception.
Tarzan is literally king of a jungle.
OK so they made a couple.
The Jungle Book literally has jungle in its title, there are bears and tigers. You don't get those in London.
OK I may have been a bit wrong there.
You were about as wrong as Dumbo was when he got drunk and thought he could see pink elephants.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which movie reinforces gender stereotypes? I'm thinking of holding a discussion about patriarchal themes in films with my literature group.
At the top of my head, I'm going with Cinderella. It's a classic example of societal norms and expectations for women in the '50s.
Hm, female politics in Disney movies? That sounds super exciting.
Yeah, you can talk about beauty standards and the need to fit those standards in order to find a man.
How so?
Well, how about the fact that all the women in the kingdom got all dolled up for the prince?
I forget how the story goes. Wasn't there some sort of ball?
Yes. They were all invited to be eligible to be the prince's bride.
Ah, right. And the prince had to choose his future queen based on looks.
That sends a negative message to viewers, which was basically that women had to rely on her looks to get married.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's you favourite Disney film?
Probably Robin Hood, I like the animals.
Really? It's alright I guess.
What! Only alright. The opening theme song is one of the greatest of all time and Maid Marion is an absolute babe.
Wasn't she a fox.
Yeah she was one foxy lady.
That's pretty weird mate.
What, so Robin Hood can fancy her but I can't?
Yeah, because he was also an animated fox and you're, apparently, a legitimate human being.
If you say so, but it feels like double standards.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know how they made a live action version of Beauty and the Beast?
Yeah, what about it?
Well, I was thinking that since they've already made a live adaption for Cinderella as well, why not also make one for Mulan?
Oh, I would love to see that.
This would be a great opportunity to cast some lesser known but equally talented Asian actors and actresses.
Do you think that all of the casting members should be able to sing? I mean, the live version could turn into another musical.
Honestly, I'd prefer it if the producers could change up the story a bit and add a some twist to it. Like they could focus more on recreating the characters and story instead of trying to replicate the Disney version.
I can see that. People might compare it to the original.
It's not just that. If people wanted to see an exact replica of it, they'd go see the Disney version.
True.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best part of Brave?
The fight at the end is awesome.
Yeah, that was very suspenseful.
It was sad, but then I was glad when her mom became human again.
I liked the accents in that movie.
Yeah, they were good.
Where did it take place?
I think it was inspired by Scotland
Okay, that makes sense.
I loved the archery scene too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Disney will ever stop making Pirates movies?
If people keep spending money, they will keep making them.
What is it about pirates that people are so attracted to?
I think part of it is the romantic lifestyle of always moving. And the gold helps.
People do love money they don't have to work for.
I would say Johnny Depp has worked pretty hard for the money he made on these movies.
He has done a lot of them. His character is so flashy and yet somehow vulnerable.
I think the outlandishness is there to cover up the vulnerablities.
That makes sense. I wish we could get a bit more of his back story, how he came to end up a pirate without remorse.
I think he has a good deal of remorse.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever think that Disney might want to make sort of a cinematic universe for their films?
Oh... God, no, I... hadn't considered that idea.
I'm sure they could retcon most of the princess movies into the same world, one way or another.
Why are you doing this? Why is this a thing you need to think about?
It just seems like it could be kind of cool. Like, Sofia and Elena are connected -- and Sofia keeps calling up the movie princesses.
Why do you know this?
Know what?
I just... okay, so... you're saying they are all connected, then?
Sort of. Through a TV show, though, and I'm not sure if it's canonical both ways or not.
Please, please, please tell me more of your fascinating theories. I won't use them in any kind of an embarrassing context, I assure you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is your favorite disney movie?
my favorite movie is froozen
who is your favorite character in frozen?
Anna is my favorite
why is Anna your favorite
because she is strong, motivating and uplifting
my favorite is elsa
why elsa?
because she could hide her emotions and she was cold sometimes and not cold other times
i think elsa is cool but my favorite is still anna
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which are cuter, the puppies from 1001 Dalmatians or the kittens from the Aristocats?
I like dogs better than cats, so I'm biased.
I get it, but the kitten that plays piano is so cute.
Aw yeah, that's a great scene.
Overall I think the Aristocats is the better movie.
Cruella de Vil is such a great villain though!
Oh, I hated her.
That's sort of the point.
No, I just thought she was mean, and not in a fun way.
True. Killing puppies is way too cruel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched Nemo last night.
Never too old for that movie.
I think that is so cute.
It is. There's so many good characters to like.
Yes there is. I love the turtles.
They are good. The way they talk.
Yes, like surfer dudes.
I wasn't a fan of the sharks though.
They were just okay.
I could watch that every time it's on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I like your dog! Is that a dalmation?
It is, yes. We had to get one after our kids watched 101 Dalmatians.
Oh my gosh, I loved that movie when I was a kid. I even read the book over and over.
It was the first book our son Jacob read. He wanted to read my copy after he watched the movie.
Whenever I see a dalmatian, I think of firefighters and Disney movies.
Yeah, my wife named him Pongo - just like in the movie.
Just as long as their is no Cruella de Vil around!
Did you see the live action movie with Glenn Close a few years ago?
I did! And don't forget 102 Dalmatians!
Hmmmm...I may pick up some popcorn so our family can watch a Disney double feature tonight!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the live action lion king remake?
I did. Waiting for them to ruin my childhood yet again!
Did you not like the jungle book or beauty and the beast remakes?
Neither were terrible, but Hollywood is getting very unoriginal.
Gee. Are there ANY Disney movies you'd like to see remade?
How about cars since it wasn't good in the first place?
I'll pass since their sequels have been even worse. Who knows how much they'll mess up a remake!
Very true! It's also a bit soon for that remake.
My guess is they'll find a way to remake Mary Poppins next.
That wouldn't surprise me at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch Disney's Moana.
Yeah, so cute! I'm sure all the little girls loved it.
The Rock was awesome in it!
He had his humble demi-god character down perfectly.
There was a nice dynamic between him and Moana.
Yeah, precious.
Some of the graphics were gorgeous.  What was the thing with the chicken?
Beats me.  Those little coconut pirates were so cute.
Loved that part. And the grandma.
The green goddess was the best though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Disney movies?
I am, I like that Disney has the rights to Marvel movies.
Yeah, that is pretty cool I like that too.
Are you exited about any upcoming movies?
Im exited to see the new Pirates of the Caribean movie and also Thor Raganarok.
Oh I see, are those also made by Disney?
Yes, both of them are.
What other Disney movies are you exited to see?
Well mainly all Marvel movies, Im just exited to watch them all.
Oh I see, im more a Star Wars fan myself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which was your favorite Disney movie from when you were a kid?
It would have to be Aladdin.
Don't tell me, you couldn't get enough of Genie?
Yeah, between Robin WIlliams vocie and humor and the magic he was always a hoot.
Yeah, but the guy who did Genie's voice in Return of Jaffar was pretty good too.
True, and I loved the little Rambo reference when he tries to fight Jafar, even though I didn't get it at first.
Plenty of pop culture references and shape shifting always made Genie funny.
Yeah, shame about Robin Wiliams, though
Definitely, the world lost a great talent with his death.
That is very true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like everyone remembers their first Disney movie. Like the one that came out when they were just old enough to go to the theater.
Oh, yeah. I remember my first was Little Mermaid.
Really? Me too!
Yeah, I went with my Dad and my brother, and when we left the theater my dad had to pop the hood for something. It was so windy the hood flew back and hit the windshield!
So that's your big memory of The Little Mermaid, huh?
Ha, yeah. I think I was about five years old.
I was a bit older. Maybe six. I remember the songs the most.
Look at this stuff. Isn't it neat!
I ran around the house with a fork for WEEKS.
I'm sure your parents loved that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want my daughter to see the classic Disney movie, "Cinderella".
Oh, I think she'll like that. Especially the dancing at the end.
Yes, I'm sure she'll like Prince Charming. What do you think she'll say about the mice?
I'm sure she will especially like Gus. He's funny.
Yes, he is. Do you remember anything scary in the movie?
Not really, just the mean stepmother. Especially when she locks Cinderella in her room.
Oh yes, I'll have to be sure to watch that part with her.
I think she'll like the movie. However, I'm sure she'll want glass slippers afterwards.
Good point. I better be ready for that.
Yes, get the credit card ready for shoes and dresses!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch Frozen
Yes
Did you like it?
I thought it was sad, but the castle seemed nice
It was better when it was unfrozen
I wonder what it would be like to have the frozen gift
It would be cool to take that ability down to the tropics
Yeah, you could show it to people who have never seen snow and watch their reaction
Did you like Olaf
Yeah, he was silly
XXXXXXXXXXX
My daughter's having a Disney princess party, and I'm trying to decide which movie we should watch.
Does she have a favourite?
Well, she loves Frozen but honestly I might tear my hair out if I hear "Let it Go" one more time!
True true! Well there are lots of other Disney movies, what about Beauty and the Beast?
The one with Belle? Oh, that one is so sweet!
And if you're tired of animation, you could even get them to watch the new live action one instead.
Isn't that the one that Emma Watson starred in?
Yep! It came out a few months ago.
I never got to see that one, that might be a good option.
It's very similar to the animated one, I think you'll enjoy it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Sleeping Beauty?
Yes, I was always very afraid of Maleficent, though.
She is the scariest villain in any Disney movie, especially when she turned into a dragon.
Plus, she cursed an innocent little baby for no real reason!
That was terrible. It's a good thing Aurora survived.
I loved how Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather bickered over her dress color.
That was a cute part. They cared about her in their own goofy way!
What was your favorite scene?
I like the "Once Upon a Dream" song, so I like the scene when it plays.
That is a good song! One of my favorite Disney songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay so there have been 3 cars movies out so far.
Yes, I know.
Which do you think is your favorite.
I'd certainly have to say Cars 1.
Well I like Cars 2.
Well Cars 1 is just where everything started, you know?
Yeah I can see that. It's where all those funny characters came around.
Yeah, characters like Mater, Lightning, and Doc Hudson.
I think Mater is my favorite character. He's hilarious.
Yeah you're totally right. Larry the Cable Guy did a great job with that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Descendants was a good movie I like the music
So did I , I liked to sing along
my little sister knows all of the dances
the costumes were also really nice
they were nice, I liked how the bad guys kids lived with the heros
It was sad that they were outcasts like that though
I know but in the end it all worked out
it did , it made you think about the "bad guys" and why they were that way
I liked it when they drove that car through that barrier into the good world
that part was neat, Disney is imaginative
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you watch beauty and the beast?
the live action one or the original animated one?
either one works, ive just seen a lot of talk about it.
oh, well ive watched the animated one but not the new live one
I heard the live one did amazing
Probably re makes always do well when you had a good movie to begin with
that is true, i just prefer watching animated verisons
same here but i do not mind about the live ones
I dont mind either, i just like anything that is disney
Same here, disney movies are awesome
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Babe my buddy invited me to go see this movie with him called Beauty and the beast.
Oh yeah that's cool i heard about that movie but i did not get to see it yet. Was it good?
Excellent I love that movie it is actually one of my favorites ever since. you can be unattractive and still have a beautiful heart.
So It really makes people realize that love does not have to be perfect it just has to be true. It don,t matter if you are not the prettiest person.
I know and they have so may different movies and cartoons that have came out since i seen it.
Um do you know who starred in the cartoon movies or any one of them I want to take my daughter to go see it. or I'll order one.
Well yeah I know Bella,Vincent and gaston starred in one of them they were all great fairytale actors.
Wow this is going to be great I may take my next store neighbor's her friends along with us or invite them over.
Good it,s a very good movie for kids it gives them a happy spirit and it has a beautiful ending.
Okay thanks will do I like to see the children in good spirits and they can learn from such a story of love.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Finding Nemo was funny and sad, I liked dory
it really was a good movie with a great happy ending
finding nemo was a cute movie
when he got lost, that part was sad
I know, and when they ended up in the fish tank
the sea turtles were the best part
they were, they are really amazing creatures
They are and I think that they really stole the show
did you know that the type of fish Nemo is, the dad usually eats the babies
I have heard something like that, that is why he ran away
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the movie Pocahontas?
I think is beautiful and very romantic.
Romantic, why?
I think is amazing that Pocahontas risked her life to save John Smith.
Other than Pocahontas, which is your favorite character in the movie?
I would have to say Meeko, he is very cute and funny.
What is one of your favorite scenes in the movie?
When Pocahontas jumps from the cliff to join Nakoma.
What is your favorite song from the movie.
I think Colors of the Wind, it´s beautiful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw The Hunchback of Notre Dame animated movie last night.
Cool.  Who directed that?
Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise.  Released in 1996.
Who was the Hunchback?
Tom Hulce.
And Esmeralda?
Demi Moore. But she didn't sing.   Heidi Mollenhauer did.
Anyone else in it?
Kevin Kline was Captain Phoebus.
Neat.  Sounds like a pretty decent Disney movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have to say Beauty and The Beast the animated version is still one of my all time favorites.
It is one of the best fairy tales I agree.
I liked their songs a lot plus the story is good.
My favorite character is Belle for sure.
What did you think of the live action version of it?
It was alright but I didn't like that they changed Gaston's song a little.
True. The original Gaston song is the best.
Emma Watson though does make a good Belle.
True but Paige OHara's voice was perfect for Belle too.
Either way i still like the Beast in the story too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
101 Dalmations.
Which one?
The original, there is no other one in my book.
Well you'd be wrong, there are sequels and remakes, but ok.
Yea, but those don't capture you in the same way as the original animated movie.
I agree, I think Cruela Devil plays an amazing villain.
Yea, you really learn to hate her, she's despicable.
Who was your favorite dog?
Poncho, for sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they will make another 101 Dalmations move?
I don't know but I enjoyed the cartoon original.
I thought the one with the actress Glenn Close was very nicely done.
Yes it was, she played a great role in that one.
Do you think a new cartoon version would be similar to the original?
I imagine it would be much better with all the special effects they have.
Do you think they would change the music to be a little more modern?
I would think so but I would hope they would keep some of the original score as well.
I loved the puppies in the movie version.
They were absolutely adorable!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What year did Toy Story come out?
Man, I don't know.  The 90's.
Just looked it up.  1995.
That's amazing.  Hard to believe that movie is so old.
The animation difference is pretty amazing between then and now.
Well, technology has come a long way.
That was back when Pixar was basically unknown.
And it put them on the map.
And inspired a franchise!
Truth be told, I don't really care for those movies too much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know that the movie Aladdin is based on a popular tale in Arabia?
Oh yes, the story is called Aladdin and the wonderful lamp
You know this is one of my favorite Disney movies!
It's a very good movie, it was released in November 1992
And after that they made two sequels!
And a television series, which was very successful
Really good since she won several awards at the Oscars
Yes! To the best soundtrack and to the best song.
And you know by whom it was produced and directed?
Of course, by the excellent Americans John Musker and Ron Clements and written by them together with the writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what was your favorite Disney movie when you were a kid?
It's kind of hard to pick just one, for me. I had a friend who loved Beauty and the Beast and my mom loved Mulan.
Those were good ones. I kind of liked Great Mouse Detective.
Oh, and The Recsuers Down Under! Those smaller movies that weren't all about singing princesses really stood out, sometimes.
The Jungle Book, Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh...
Peter Pan, too.
Didn't they do Robin Hood?
Yeah, with the main characters as foxes! And they reused some of the animations for the dancing in The Aristocats!
Ooh, I almost forgot that one! It's been so long.
Too long.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Little Mermaid?
No, I haven't seen it. What is it about?
It's about a mermaid named Ariel who gives up her voice in order to be able to go on land.
Why does she want to go on land?
She falls in love with a handsome prince, but since she's a mermaid she can't get to know him.
Does she end up marrying him?
Yes, but first she has to make him fall in love with her even though she can't talk.
That sounds challenging. I don't understand how you can fall in love with someone if you can't talk to them.
The evil sea witch Ursula tries to stop them from falling in love by using Ariel's voice to woo the prince.
Wow, that sounds kind of interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that one movie Disney made called BFG?
It's about that Giant that is actually smaller than the other giants and a good one right?
Yup that's the one. I liked it a lot but what did you think?
I thought it was pretty good. It had some funny moments.
The way the giant spoke was funny and the little girl was adorable with her personality.
I was a little surprised about the green drink though.
True, the having them fart in the Queen of England's presence was a bit much.
It was pretty funny though but I feel like slightly tacky.
The best part was the ending though.
I loved how they forced the evil giants to be on a rock island with nothing but the horrible vegetable to eat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi Danielle!
Hi Tabitha!
Do you remember any of the lines from when you starred as Belle in the Troupe production of "Beauty and the Beast?"
Yeah. Almost all of them.
No way!
Well, I just watched the Disney version of that again last night, so...
No surprise there!
Right.
What was your favorite line?
"Life is a box of chocolates." But, of course, that was Forest Gump!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your favorite Disney movies?
My favorites are Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin
Those are great. I love Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella too.
I think Maleficent is one of the scariest Disney villains.
I agree, she's so dark and violent.
What was your favorite part of Sleeping Beauty?
Actually the ending. When she's dancing with the Prince and her dress is changing colors. You?
I liked when the fairies gave up and used their magic wands to get the cottage ready.
That was cool, but that is what caused the raven to see they were there.
You're right I forgot about that. He was circling the chimney!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that movie that had monsters scaring kids for energy?
Monster's Inc.?
Oh yeah, that's it. I loved that movie.
It was a good movie. Sully was my favorite character.
I actually liked Mike the green one eyed ball.
Mike was very funny.
That little girl Boo was very cute and funny as well.
Yeah it was a good film. It had a good story.
I think they've made a couple sequels right?
I don't know, maybe one or two.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like disney movies
Yes they are so awesome
I love them
I cant wait for the next frozen to come out
Me either
I wonder what the plot will be like
Me too because they didnt leave an ending for a next one
Exactly
Im so curious
Same
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good disney movies lately?
I watched the new Beauty and Beast movie last night.
Who was your favorite character?
I really like the beast. Who's yours?
I liked Chip the teacup. He's funny and cute.
All the animated objects were funny.
They really updated the design of the object characters.
Why was Lumeer the only one with legs I wonder?
That was a little strange.
It was a good movie if you overlook some of the features of the objects.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see where there's going to be a remake of the movie Watcher in the Woods?
I never the original, what was it about?
A couple with two children rent a home in the country and weird things start to happen to the daughters
Who plays in it?
The parents are David McCallum and Carroll Baker. Bette Davis plays the woman they rent the house from.
I like to see all them play. Bette Davis was one of my favorites.
Well her character's daughter disappeared years before and was never found. The daughters of the couple start having strange things happen to them that and Bette Davis thinks it has to do with her daughter.
What's the strange things that happen?
Well, the oldest daughter starts seeing an image of a girl blindfolded in mirrors and hearing voices.
I'm going to have to watch that one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Pirates of the Carribean?
Yes that movie was awesome all around.
Orlando Bloom played a good hero.
And of course Geoffrey Rush was good as Captain Barbosa.
But Johnny Depp stole the show.
Captain Jack Sparrow cracked me up.
He sure liked his rum.
I thought the monkey was funny too.
Of course, we will remember this as the time we almost caught...
Captain Jack Sparrow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally watched Up like you told me and I cried!
I think everybody has cried at that movie?
That whole thing with Carl and Ellie was so sad.
They made you love them and then they killed her!
I wanted them to just be happy forever!
But wasn't Russell just the cutest?
Yes! I want to go on an adventure with him and Carl.
But it'd have to be in that house right?
Well of course. You can't go anywhere unless you travel in that house.
And you have to adopt Dug!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know that Warner bros are copy cats
How so
Well when they made their cartoons they were copys
Copys?
Yeah
How so
Well the looney tunes pretty much copied Disneys cartoons
In what way
I think based on the way the humor was
Interesting thought
XXXXXXXXXXX
In what year was the children's movie Mulan premiered?
It was released in 1998!
Mulan is based on the story of a young woman who went to war on behalf of her family
Yes, she did it to protect her dad.
This story speaks of the bravery that has the Chinese girl
Of course going to war and posing as a man
Accompanied by Crick-Kee, he jumps lucky fuck the grandmother Fa!
And Mushu a little dragon
At that time women could not enter the army
Yes! That's why Mulan pretends to be a man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Every Halloween I watch the Disney movie, Hocus Pocus.
I remember that film it came-out in 1993.
Bette Midler was very good at playing the head witch.
There were three witches, weren’t there?
Yes, the youngest witch was blonde, and lovely, but very crule.
I remember, and the middle witch was short, and had black hair.
I thought the children’s acting was very good as well.
Yes, Thora Birch was so young but she was very good playing the role of Dani Dennison.
I absolutely loved Thackery Binx, the boy changed into a talking black cat.
Yes, I was so glad at the end when he got to return to his family.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in the movie Frozen?
My favorite character would probably be Anna.
What about Elsa?
I like Elsa, but as a younger sibling myself, I identify with Anna more.
I like Elsa better because of her ice powers.
Do you think in the next movie, Anna will get powers too?
Probably not, I heard in the next movie Olaf is going to have a bigger role.
Oh really? I didn't really like Olaf's character.
I didnt like Olaf either, I found his character annoying.
Me too, but children like his character, and the movie is most popular with kids.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some underrated Disney movies?
I actually have a few I loved as a kid.
I only know the more famous ones.
There was one called "The Sword in the Stone".
I never seen it.
It was about Arthur, from the Camelot legend, but as a kid.
Did it have Merlin?
It did. He was more like the Genie in Alladin, a magical time traveler etc.
So they copied Alladin?
No, it came out like fifty years before Alladin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Disney's movie Pirates of the Caribbean?
Which one? Pirates of the Caribbean: part 4 On Stranger Tides?
No not that one, I'm talking about Pirates of the Caribbean 5, released back in May this year!
Yes I got it, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Thats the latest one right?
Yes thats the one I'm saying about, have you seen the movie? this time Will Turner comes back!
Yes I heard that too, hope I would be able to go for the movie this weekend. Are you a fan of Will?
Actually I like almost all characters in the movie series Pirates of the Caribbean. Including non human characters!
Yeah exactly, all characters in the movie are really interesting, but I like Jack Sparrow!
Captain Jack Sparrow!! thats his name, Elizabeth Swann says that in second part of the movie series!
Yeah i saw that part, but what happen to Elizabeth Swann? She hasn't been in the movie since the third part?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think my favorite song is the one Olaf sings.
Ya I'm sure nobody would forget Olaf.
I know I won't.
I think Olaf may be my favorite Disney character.
Hmm.. that's a tough one I'm not sure who mine is.
I think my favorite Disney movie may be UP though.
I still haven't seen Up.
You really should I thought it was great.
Ya I've heard that. I need to remember to watch it.
I actually have the movie do you want to watch it now?
XXXXXXXXXXX
DID YOU SEE THE NEW DISNEY ANIMATED MOVIE MOANA?
YES! I LOVED IT!
MOANA'S SINGING WAS SO BEAUTIFUL!
I LOVED HER SONG "HOW FAR I'LL GO"
YES, WHEN SHE SANG IT AT THE GRAMMY'S IT WAS A HIT.
I ALSO LOVED THE ROCK AS THE CHARACTER MAUI WAS GOOD CASTING.
I LIKED THE LITTLE ANIMAL CHARACTERS TOO!
THE CHICKEN AND THE PIG WE'RE REALLY CUTE.
IT ALSO HAD A GOOD MESSAGE.
YES, IT SHOWED THEY HAD BRAVERY. THE COCONUTS WERE ALSO VERY FUNNY!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When I was in Chicago some years ago I was staying in a hotel next to the theater where the Lion King stage musical was playing.
Did you see it?
I tried to. I waiting in line at the Will Call.
What's the Will Call?
If someone hasn't shown or there are extra tickets they'll sell them to you the same day for that night.
Did you get in?
I was third in line. The two ahead of me got the last tickets.
Oh no!
I was sorely disappointed. But I saw in a few months later when I returned.
That's good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, have you heard about all the new disney sequels coming out in the next couple years?
Yes, I have! I'm so excited for the new Incredibles movie!
Me too. I really hope Samuel L. Jackson reprises his role as Frozone.
Yes! He's my favorite character! How did that one line go...
"Honey, where's my super suit?"
YES! That's it!
I really hope they don't do a flash forward like they do with some Disney sequels though.
Oh, totally. However, i really liked when they did that with Toy Story 3.
Oh me too. The ending made me cry for days.
When Andy when to college without Woody it nearly broke my inner child's heart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Beauty and the Beast is such a good movie, have you seen the new version/
NO  but I would like to, but nothing can beat the cartoon
I was always worried the rose would die too soon and the curse would never be broken
I know, I can't imagine living my life as a beast
some people say she had a syndrome where she wanted to stay with the person who captured her
I have heard that theory, a lot of Disney movies have dark undertones
this one really did  and Gaston was terrible, I think he was a bad man
and Belle always seemed like she had no idea what was going on
I know, she should have been more careful
she really should have, she really upset her poor little dad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember when we went to New York City to watch the Broadway production of "The Lion King"?
Yeah, It was awesome! Especially during the openning scene, when the animals were all around!
Yeah. Pretty nice.
You don't sound enthusiastic about your comment. What's wrong?
Oh, I was just remebering the movie and the first time I watched it. It made me so sad.
When Mufassa died?
Yeah.
The good news with the movie is that you can rewatch the first part of the movie, before Mufsssa died, and see him alive again.
True.
You just have to stop the video before the bad part!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you remember the name of the evil woman in Sleeping Beauty?
Yeah of course I do! Her name was Maleficent. You know, I don't think she was all that bad.
Really?!? Why do you say that?
All she wanted way to be invited to the party they had welcoming the birth of Aurora.
Okay, but when she wasn't invited she placed a curse on the baby. That seems pretty wrong to me.
Well that's a good point. She is capable of turning into a pretty cool dragon though.
Yes that's definitely true. Good thing Prince Phillip was there to help lift the curse on Aurora.
Okay I take it back, Maleficent was pretty evil. I still think if she'd just been invited to Aurora's party none of that would have happened.
Well I think if Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather had done their jobs the curse would never have befallen Aurora!
That's a lot of blame to cast on the Good Fairies. And it wouldn't have made much of a movie if Sleeping Beauty never went to sleep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Finally saw Tangled last night.
Finally?  You must be really behind on your movies.
Indeed I am.  Anyway, it was really cute!
I love Mandy Moore in it.
She has a great, clear princess voice.
And I give credit to whomever voiced Flynn Rider too.
Oh, completely.  He sounded superb on I See the Light.
That scene is just fantastic. The boat, the lanterns...
The emotion just swelling up in all of us, so touching!
Truly great movie and lovely animation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello

its cool and about bravery and becoming king.

XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to watch Peter Pan again!
We have to because we can't ever grow up!
We have to stay young just like Peter and the lost boys.
Tinkerbell is so great in that movie with being so protective of Peter.
Tinkerbell makes me laugh so hard.
But Wendy is the greatest storyteller of all time.
I love how the lost boys want her to be their mom.
I sometimes even like Captain Hook.
Especially when the crocodile is after him!
That silly crocodile!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I was building a snowman this afternoon and it reminded me of that song from Frozen.
Do you want to build a snowman?
No, the one Ana sings to Elsa when their parents die.
Do you want to build a snowman?
No I did that early today. Damn I wish I could remember the song?
Do you want to build a snowman!
No I don't, let it go already.
No, you let it go.
Stop being such an Elsa and go outside.
Fine. The cold never bothered me anyway.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Cinderella movie?
I haven't but I really want to!
I don't think it was as good as the animated one, but the acting was decent.
What about the new Beauty and The Beast, have you seen that?
Yeah, Emma Watson was phenomenal!
I thought so too!
She actually reminds me of the animated Belle, which I think was even better.
Yeah, I thought that was a really good choice.
Do you remember who played the beast?
No, not really but the CGI to make him look like a beast was unreal!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have a question about Peter Pan the movie.
Go for it.
What is the physics behind pixie dust?
You mean how does it work?
Yeah, like how does a physical material give one weightlessness in order to fly?
Bro, you're asking the wrong person here. I failed physics.
And Tinker Bell. That pixie dust just keeps coming off of her forever!
Yeah, so what?
It never runs out! How is that possible?
I think it's time we watch that movie again and find out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you remember how many dwarfs that were in Snow White?
I think there were about twelve maybe?
Hey do you remember that Disney movie with that girl that falls asleep when she eats an apple?
Yes I think that was Snow White.
Hey do you know the name of that Disney movie with that evil witch with horns and green skin?
Yeah I think that was Sleeping Beauty.
Hey what was the name of that movie with the lions?
Come on that has to be the Lion King.
Hey what was that movie with the beast that turns into a man?
I think that was that Disney movie Beauty and the Beast.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think there are more female villains, or male ones in Disney cartoons?
I think there are more female villains.
Can you name some female villains?
Ursula, The Queen from Snow White, the mom from Cinderella and The wicked lady from Sleeping Beauty.
Okay, maybe there are some male ones you can name too?
Scar, Shere Kan, Prince John, Jafar, Gaston.
Wow, I did not realize there were so many men villains too.
I guess there is an abundance of both.
Who is your favorite female villain?
Ursula
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Muppets were so much fun, I liked shaggy dog
I liked Kermit he was so funny
the way he was with Ms Piggy was funny
a pig and a frog is a weird combo
Yes it is I do not know how they came up with that
seriously, who comes up with these ideas
I like how someone made the puppets, a lot of work went into them
that is true, and people were making the voices also
I think the idea of muppets and the things they do is a creative idea
I know, only a creative person could come up with that
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's that new Pirates of the Caribbean movie called?
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell no Tales.
Right, that's the one. We should go see it.
Sure. I love some Johnny Depp.
I hope he keeps making more Pirates of the Caribbean movies. They're so unique.
I enjoy the world and the lore. Of course it doesn't hurt that Johnny Depp is the perfect Jack Sparrow.
I wish they would bring back Orlando Bloom to play Will Turner and Keira Knightley to play Elizabeth Turner.
They're in the new movie from what I'm told.
Are you serious?
Yeah. They are there but only at the end for a little bit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your  favorite disney movie?
The little mermaid. You?
I love Ariel as well. So The Little mermaid is up there.
But is it your favorite disney movie?
Well it is between that and Dumbo.
Dumbo, really?
Yes, Dumbo is actually terrific.  It has one of the best story arcs ever.
I had never thought about that aspect, just such an old one I forget about it sometimes.
An oldie but a goodie... you should rewatch it. I am sure you will enjoy it again and again.
I think I will. Thanks for the reminder.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you cry when Mufasa died in The Lion King?
Of course I did, I think everyone did! That was the most tragic scene in movie history next to Bambi.
You know I've never actually seen Bambi.
You've never seen Bambi?! I thought every child was required to be traumatized by that movie.
No for some reason that one got by me. I really want to see The Lion King the musical.
Oh I know, it's been running for a while with a lot of success.
I loved that James Earl Jones played an African king the same way he did in Coming to America.
Oh I know, that was really fitting. He has the voice for it.
That's for sure. I think there's a Frozen musical isn't there?
Yes I've seen it and it's amazing. Just be prepared to have the songs in your head again for a while.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We finally saw Moana.
Wasn't it great?
Yeah, I liked it a lot. Especially the music.
I know, my kids won't stop singing it!
It was nice to see a Disney character that looked different from the other princesses.
I agree. It was a fun story about girl power.
I thought The Rock was pretty funny in it, too.
Yeah. Doesn't it make you want to go lounge on a beach?
Yes, it was so beautiful!
You're making me want to re-watch it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your all time favorite Disney movie?
Oh, that's a tough one...I guess I'd have to say The Lion King.
Really? I would have thought you'd be more of a Disney princess fan.
Oh I am, but the Lion King is probably my all time favorite movie. It's a masterpiece!
Mine too! There are so many powerful moments. Like when Simba sees his father in the sky, or when Nala and Simba finally reunite.
So true. My favorite part is when Simba is with Timon and Pumba though. It's so whimsical and takes away from the pain you feel for Simba after he loses his Dad.
Oh I hated Scar for that. And for locking up Zazu. And pretty much everything. Scar was the worst!
He really was but in the best possible way. He's the type of villain you love to hate.
I have it on DVD, you should come over and watch this weekend.
Definitely! We can have a sing-along! I can't wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Frozen?
Who hasn't seen that movie?
Well what did you think about it?
Well at first I hated it but then I learned to really appreciate it.
I thought it was too much of a basic storyline.
No way! It was the first Disney movie to star two female leads that weren't going after a man.
Ok, but they could've done without that stupid song, what was it called?
Let it Go, which is what you should do.
That song wont get out of my head now!
Yet another reason as to why it was such a good movie, it stays with you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I never thought I would cry during a Disney movie.
Really, which one did you in?
It was Up, the thing had me melting on the floor.
Oh for sure, I had to hold back tears in the theater.
The beginning section with his wife killed me.
For me it was when he found his wife's adventure diary.
Oh my god definitely, when he saw all of the pictures of their marriage.
Up managed to be one of Disney and Pixar's best films.
No doubt, the magic of those two studios is unparalleled.
They manage to connect human emotions to a child's story everytime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady and the Tramp is one of my all time favorite movies.
Me too! What's your favorite part?
I love the part where Lady and Tramp are eating spaghetti and they kiss.
Aw, me too. It's so adorable.
It's so cute, and it's a classic scene.
I agree.
It's one of those moments in history that just always lives forever.
Yeah. Like Cinderella and the glass slipper.
They're just so adorable I want to hug them both.
I know the feeling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched Aladdin?
That movie was great, a classic rags to riches story.
Aladdin did get pretty lucky.
I know if he didn't find the genie I wonder what would have happened.
These movies also has a sense of magic so it's tough to say.
Disney really makes it seem like everything is possible.
The Genie was a funny character.
I enjoyed the Genie a lot. He was a magical character.
Do you think the romanticism was too cliche?
It could be seen that way but I still liked the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love your Moana t-shirt! Did you love that movie?
Yes, even my boys love to watch it and they already know all of the songs and sing along.
How cute! Yes, those songs are catchy....like the songs from Frozen!
Which Disney princess is your favorite?
I love Aurora from Sleeping Beauty. She was always the one I wanted to be growing up.
Really? I thought you were more of a Pocohantas type, a free spirit. Like, running through the woods barefoot and stuff.
I remember watching Pocohontas in the theatres and collecting the figurines from Happy Meal toys.
Are you going to see Cars 3?
I don't think we will go see it in the theatres, I can't get the kids to really pay attention to the Cars movies, but definitely when it comes out on video.
We are planning to see it this week. I hope it will be good! I love hearing Owen WIlson's voice as Lightning McQueen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard they are coming out with a sequel to your favorite Disney movie "Big Hero 6"
I love that movie.I want to be Hiro.
I know I don't know when I hope it's soon.
zi wish they would do more Narnia movies.
I know the lion and special effects in that movie are awesome.
I know it's one of your favorite Disney movies.
You know what my all time favorite Disney movie is right?
yes, oldie but goodie, song of the South
Yes it is the best disney movie of all time
I know, you've watched it a million times
XXXXXXXXXXX
Annie is such a classic movie, It made me wish I had a daddy warbucks
same here! but to get to him you would have to like as an orphan
that is true and they had it pretty bad
I know they had to clean all day it was bad
and eat awful food and wear rags for clothes
Annie deserved what happened in the end
she did I hope the other girls had better lives
so do I , I hope that they did not stay there
I bet they all got placed somewhere else
probably, after the authorities found out that they had been neglected
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh my god the first 15 minutes of UP is the most emotional I've ever been watching a Disney movie.
Yeah Ellie and Carl's relationship was just the best.
You know they should make a prequel to up that showcased Ellie and Carl's adventures when they were growing up.
I mean they kind of alluded to that and they actually did show a little bit.
Yeah but I could watch a whole movie about it!
Wouldn't it change your perspective now that you know that Charles Muntz is the bad guy?
Hmmm, maybe it would a little but I bet that Disney could find a way around that.
I think I'd like to see a sequel but with Russell as the father and he has a child of his own now.
They should make the child a little girl!
Yeah that'd be cool! And they could flashback to lessons and memories that he had with Carl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw The Lion King recently with my grandkids.
Oh, I like that one.
I don't like the scene where the father lion dies.
Poor Simba thinks it all his fault.
I know.  But then he meets Timon and Pumba.
And learns the best song - Hakuna Matata!
It means no worries!
We should all live like that - no worries!
I know.  But he meets Nala and they live happily ever after.
Like all Disney movies, right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Disney movies?
Of course I do!
What is your favorite?
I'd have to say the Lion King.
Did you see they are making a live action version?
I heard that. Do you know when it is coming out?
Not until 2019.
Oh, that's when the new Frozen movie is coming out too.
Disney definitely plans ahead.
With all the animation and editing necessary, I'm sure they have to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite disney movie?
Cinderella.
Oh that movie is beautiful. Which is your favorite?
I love the one with Brandy and Whitney Houston.
Me too! Isn't the music to it just great?
Oh yeah totally!
I haven't seen the cartoon one in a very long time.
Me neither. I need to make a point to do so.
We should watch it together.
Yes definitely!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Brave?
Yes
That little girl was so selfish
It had a good ending though
It did
But i did feel really bad for the mom
I know
Her as a bear broke your heart
It really did
Im glad the ending was happy
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ello
Yo
I cannot stop wondering something
What?
What if the lion king was all siimbas dream
What do you mean
Well the way it is laid out seems dream like
I think you are looking to hard into this
Nah i am not at all
You might be
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about Disney and them purchasing a lot of popular movie series?
I think its great I´ve always loved Disney.
Yeah, I think they give movies a special touch.
Do you remember the clasical Disney movies?
How could I forget, theres a lot of good movies that marked my childhood.
Really? whats your favorite movie of that time.
I liked Aladin a lot what about you?
Well mine is Beuty and the Beat is was just a great movie.
Yeah I know! Disney used to have pretty great movies
Yeah, and its following the same foot steps now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched tangled for the first time
Did you like it
It was so great
I love the witches song
Mother knows best?
Yes its so catchy
I know i was singing along to it
I always sing along to it
Its a fun song
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
You'll never guess what I watched with the kids last night.
What?
The North Avenue Irregulars!
No! Really?
Yeah, I just had to share it with the kids. It was one of my favorite Disney movies growing up.
Mine, as well. I don't think anybody remembers it though.
I think you and I are the only ones!
Well, the only person people nowadays would know from the movie is Cloris Leachman.
That's true. I don't think anyone remembers Karen Valentine anymore.
Oh, she was one of my favorites back in the day, so pretty and cute. I think I'm going to have to watch the movie now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like selena gomez as an actress
Me too.
Did you see the movie princess protection program?
The one with selena gomez and demi lovato?
Yes thats the one
That one was good, and it had a good ending
I like how they starting out disliking each other and ended uo being best friends
I liked that aspect too
Disney movies are so heartwarming
Thats why i love them
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched some of the older Disney movies, the ones with Haley Mills?
I don't remember.  What are some of them about?
There's one called Summer Magic.  It has her going to Maine with her family.
I'm still not remembering. What else?
They rent a house from this rich guy they've never met.  An old man is the caretaker and he agrees to let them stay.
Wait a second!  At the end, the rich guy turns up and he's young and good looking!
Right! He immediately likes Haley Mills character and the movies ends with you having the impression that they will get together.
I do remember that!  I remember one where she traveled on a ship looking for her parents.
I think that was called In Search of the Castaways.  It had some really great special effects for the time period.
It did.  Disney put out some good movies back in the day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, which Disney movies have you seen lately?
I actually just watched, "Finding Dory" with my son.
That was an awesome movie. I didn't think I'd like it because of it being a sequal.
I get what you mean. Sequels usually aren't that good, but that one was awesome.
Yes it was! I love how they gave the backstory on Dory. She was one of my favorite Disney characters.
Me too! You have to love Ellen doing her voice.
She was a perfect fit for her! Disney did a good job choosing her as the voice.
What other Disney movies have you seen lately?
I saw Moana since Netflix has been streaming it.
That movie is amazing. Such a great role model for girls.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so excited Disney did an actual movie of beauty and the Beast.
Oh I know, I can't wait to buy it.
Did you see it in theatres?
No, I decided to wait til it is out on DVD.
I wonder how Emma Watson did as Belle?
Oh I bet she was amazing.
Hopefully it is as good as everyone says.
I hope so too. I don't want to be disappointed.
I guess we will just have to wait and see.
We will have to watch it together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Lion King has the best music of all the Disney movies.
Disney has so many movies with amazing music.
Yes, but the Lion King wasn't just a movie success. It was a broadway success as well.
That's so true.
I just love the story of the Lion King.
It really brings the complicated relationship of father and son to light.
I know and how no matter the differences, fathers would give their lives for their children.
That's true for mothers as well.
Wow! Disney really brings their characters to life.
They sure do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana yet?
No, I haven't but I really want to.
It is out on Netflix now, you need to watch it!
Really? I guess I have no excuse.
Yeah the music in it is great.
I know! I love listening to the songs.
You know they were written by the same guy who did Hamilton?
No, I didn't know that. No wonder they are so good.
And the movie is pretty great too.
Well, I will need to watch it soon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is you favorite Disney movie?
I love so many, it would be hard to choose. I think my favorite would be The Little Mermaid.
Great choice. I like that one too.
There are great characters and songs!
Ariel is a beautiful princess. That hair!
I think Sebastian is hilarious.
The part where her dad gives up power just so she can have her voice back always gets me.
Disney movies always have an emotional scene!
I know it is not realistic but I have always found Mermaids to be very magical.
I think its that its under water and it is more of a mystery to us.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Swiss Family Robinson?
That movie was epic
The people crash landed on the island, but seemed to make the best of it
I would have built another boat
Maybe that just wasn't in the movie
I guess that would have taken a while. Although they seemed to spend a lot of time on their tree house
I like how they thought about the kids. They would want to start a family of their own after a while
Wasn't the youngest kid funny
It was funny how he trapped the elephant
They had so many animals
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really love the soundtrack to Lilo & Stitch.
I do too! I love all of the Elvis songs.
I keep forgetting that he had a major impact in Hawaii. Explains why Lilo is so fond of him.
The scene where she is in bed, with the record player is such an eighties thing.
It sure is! How many times did we do the same? Lay in bed, with the record player at arms length.
Reach over and grab the needle and replay it. Just like Lilo did.
So many classics in that one movie. So many things that are truly Hawaii.
The shaved ice.
The Hula lessons.
Each time I watch those scenes, I am inspired to take Hula lessons myself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was able to get my daughter the snow white and the seven dwarves movie and she loved it
I also am a big fan of that movie
The names that they gpcame up with the seven dwarfs was so funny
Yeah I believe they were sleep dopey bashful sneezy happy grumpy and doc
The concept behind the poisoned Apple was a little creepy
I think she was really crazy
Snow white was such a loving character in that movie
You had to fall in love with her when she met the dwarfs
The end was a tell tale romance
Yeah she got kidpssed by The Prince from her slumber and woke up
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Hands down The Lion King.
Nice that's my choice as well, such a classic film.
It really is and I'm not ashamed to admit it, I cried when Mufasa died.
It really hit you right in the heart, Scar was a great villain though.
Oh absolutely one if the best that Disney has ever had.
Couldn't agree more, but it was so nice when Simba got his revenge.
It was truly a feel good sort of moment.
I sometimes wish they would make a sequel, I know they have made a direct to video one, but a proper theatrical sequel.
My only concern would be, could they capture the same magic again?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that new Star Wars movie that recently came out?
Yes, but it sure is dissapointing compared to the George Lucas Star Wars.
True, Disney making new Star Wars movies is a disgrace.
Well, you know how businesses operate these days. Disney of course sees alot of profit in making new Star Wars movies.
I understand, it's just dissapointing in the sense that you know they aren't going any good Star Wars movies that can compete with the original Star Wars movies.
On the bright side, we get to see new lightsaber battles on screen
Yes, but that is for the casual audience.
Absolutely, I know that Star Wars is about having a good story.
I thought it was cool how Samuel L Jackson played Mace Windu in the Star Wars prequels.
Yes, I heard he even demanded that he gets to have a purple lightsaber made just for his character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what I saw the other day?
What?
The Disney movie, The Little Mermaid!
Oh my gosh, I remember that movie!  Ariel was a great Mermaid princess.
I know.  She had such a beautiful voice, too.
Yeah, she really did.  The pelican was hilarious, too.
I know, and I loved watching her try to brush her hair with a fork.
Yeah, it truly had some great parts.  What about the lobster?
Oh yeah, the lobster was great!
He cracked me up.  I love that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Cars 3? Yes, there are three Cars movies.
Wait, what was Cars 2 about again?
The first one happened with Sally at Radiator Springs and the second was the spy one.
Oh, yah, I remember now.  Didn't Mater eat wasabi thinking it was ice cream?
Yah, that was the one.
So, what is Cars 3 about?
I haven't seen it, yet. I saw some previews with what I thought was an electric car.
That would be crazy, if Flash raced an electric car.
It would.  I don't think Lasseter did the storyline, though
I like Lasseter films.  If someone else directed it, I doubt Flash would win his big race.  Have you ever ridden in a Tesla?
XXXXXXXXXXX
My daughters are always watching Zootopia. They really like it a lot.
Oh, yes, I have seen it. It is a really good movie.
My favorite actress is Ginnifer Goodwin. She plays Judy.
She did do a good job, but my favorite actor is Jason Bateman. Not in the beginning, but at the end of the story.
Yes, he did a good job in the movie too.
What is your favorite part of the movie?
I enjoyed the part where Judy and Nick become friends and decide to work together. And you?
My favorite part is when the bad guys are caught. Boy, what a surprise to see it was the mayor!
I know, right. It was a twist to the movie.
I give the movie 5 stars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am thinking about going for a movie tonight. You want to join?
Which movie are you going to watch?
Not yet decided.
Oh! We can go for 'Beauty and the Beast'. Did you watch the trailer?
Yes, I was wonderstruck by the background. Reminds me of Alice in Wonderland.
Yes! Emma Watson looks gorgeous as ever.
Yes, she does. I heard Ian Mckellen also has a cameo.
That sounds so cool. Which show would work?
A show is available at 9 PM. Okay?
Yes, sure. Excited to watch the surreal world with full of breathtaking CGI effects.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I noticed something about almost all Disney movies.  There are almost no 2-parent families.
What do you mean?
Think about it.  Bambi, Cinderella, Lion King, Toy Story(s), Dumbo, Sleeping Beauty...
Wow, I never realized that.
Sometimes there's two but something terrible happens.  Like Finding Nemo.
Are there any with whole families?
The Incredibles has both parents.  Maybe Brave?
The one with Merida?  Yeah, I think so.
They sould show more 2-parent families.  Even same-sex couples.
Right, that doesn't imply some sort of tragedy or divorce.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like disney movies?
I love them!
Well, i was reading a note the other day, it seems that Disney is releasing a live action movie about Mulan.
That sounds cool, i actually liked that one.
Yeah, i'm not sure, i think the cartoon it's pretty special already.
I know what you mean, but, hey! you may be surprised, i'm guessing they will do something just great.
Well,i hope they don't change the soundtrack.
Sure, Christina Aguilera should be on that production.
Totally agree, she's an amazing singer.
I know. Well i think we will have to wait a little more to see how this movie goes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what movie I think of all the time?
No, what movie?
I think of 101 Dalmatians.
That's really random. Why do you think of it?
Every night my dog will listen to other dogs barking outside and start to bark too.
So it reminds you of that scene from the movie with the dogs passing along a message from the other dogs?
It reminds me exactly of that.
That's funny. I used to love that movie when I was a kid.
Me too! I loved one of the puppies named Lucky.
I always like Patches the best myself.

Have you seen Frozen? It's my favorite Disney movie.
Of course I've seen it. But I didn't think that it was as good as some older Disney movies.
I know some people think that the story was too simple, but I disagree. It was great to finally see a movie that focuses on a relationship between sisters, and not just romantic relationships.
That's true. I did like that aspect of the movie a lot.
It also sent a powerful message about accepting who we are. It's the only way to fully be free of the things holding you back.
The song "Let It Go" was perfect to convey that message. It was also one of the best Disney songs ever, in my opinion.
Yes I agree. I think a lot of the movie's popularity was thanks to that song.
Yeah it really made the movie very recognizable even for people who don't watch Disney movies much.
Now every little girl wants an Anna and Elsa cake for their birthday.
True. But they are great role models for kids so that's good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been on the Frozen ride yet?
Yeah, I thought it was ok but not exactly what I thought.
Who is your favorite "Main" character?
Minnie mouse, well or Daisy.
Here is the biggest one: Animated beauty and the beast or real life.....
Real life by far, I didn't think I would but I fell in love with it.
Have you ever been to Walt Disney World?
Oh yeah, we are actually DVC members.
Whats your favorite park out of the 4?
Honestly, most people hate it but I love Epcot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see that new Frozen movie when it comes out?
No probably not.
Aw, why not?
I've never been a big fan of animated films.
Those are the best kind of Disney films though!
They're good for some people, I just prefer the live action approach.
Because it feels more real?
Yea, that and it's easier to connect to a character when it's someone giving human emotion and reactions on screen.
That makes sense.
Maybe one day if you're being nice I'll go see one with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My old college roommate and I were so excited to see The Princess and The Frog.
Why?
It was the first black Disney princess and it is set in New Orleans, where she and I went to college.
Oh yeah, I forgot you lived there before.
I got pretty nostalgic watching the different locations in the movie.
I can imagine.
Thioe day were so fun. I loved New Orleans and I love my old room mate
Plus it's a quality movie.
Of course, Disney never steers you wrong.
They really are a class act.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just showed Mary Poppins to my kids for the first time the other day.
How did they like it?
They really enjoy the parts with the songs, especially "A Spoonful of Sugar."
I can see that. What kid wouldn't like to be able to clean up a mess with a snap?
That would be amazing! And Julie Andrews is such an amazing actress.
Also, Dick Van Dyke is awesome as Bert.
Have you heard about the sequel coming out?
Yes, I am so excited because Lin-Manuel Miranda will be in it!
I saw some pictures online from the production. It seems like his role will be kind of like Bert in the original.
Yes, except I think he is a street lamp lighter instead of a chimney sweep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Rogue One that came out a while ago?
Not yet, what is it about?
aren't you afraid of spoiler?
I don't mind that much, I have my own opinions after watching a movie or tv series, so tell me
it's basically fills a gap between empire strikes back and last hope, where princess leila got the death star's design flaw info
oh, that sounds intriguing
yes indeed, I didn't know there are so much to tell between those 2 movies
yeah, does it end well? Did any important character die?
well, I'll leave that for you to find out
fare enough
XXXXXXXXXXX
When i was at the movie theater the other day I saw a trailer for a new Disney movie called Coco. It looks interesting.
I haven't seen any trailers yet. what is it about?
Its about this boy that learns to play guitar by watching old movies of a famous singer and guitar player.
Oh yes, that is interesting.
He later goes to where the man is burried and holds his guitar that is on display, and then something happens...
What happens?
I don't know if he turns into a ghost or he just starts seeing dead people. That happens to his dog too.  It's kind of confusing.
I'm intrigued. So what happens next?
He finds like a secret town. And then the trailer ends. Its' coming out Thanksgiving weekend of this year.
It's vague but interesting at the same time. Will definitely have to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I came to the realization that our group of friends are likeSnow White's seven dwarves.
Well there are seven of us, do you mean like personality-wise too?
Oh definitely.
Well which one am I?
Oh you're definitely the Sneezy one in our group.
Haha that's pretty accurate I do have crazy allergies.
Exactly, I almost had you down as Dopey.
That would have made me Grumpy.
Nope, I put myself down as grumpy. Your boyfriend I put as Dopey.
That makes sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite newer Disney movie?
Well, I really liked Finding Dory a lot.
Oh, that was really funny.
Yeah, they came up with such a great story line.
Definitely, and the scenes with the van driving out of control were great.
They had a long time to come up with something good and it worked.
I also really liked Brave.
It was nice to see that they put out a movie with a strong female lead.
Yeah, both Merida and her mom got to be shown as strong women in that movie.
It was good to see a movie that wasn't just a love story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that a new lion king is coming out?
Yes but it wont be until next year
I know its just crazy a new one is coming
i dont think kids today will remember the orginal one
maybe but it wouldnt be hard for them to watch it to get up to date
good point, you can see anything nowadays especially with the internet
exactly, i wonder if it will follow with simbas life
hopefully, and i would like to see timbon and pumba also
i loved those guys, their song was awesome
i loved their song too, it was so catchy
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
I don't like Disney
Why?
I'm a 33 year old man
So?
So they don't appeal to me
No kids I take it
I hate children
I think I'm done here...
..bye..
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie of all time?
I really like The Lion King. How about you?
I'm a Little Mermaid fan myself.
I like that one too. I think those two Disney movies have some of the best music!
I love the song "Under the Sea."
Doesn't that one crab sing that song? What's his name?
Sebastian is the crab's name.
Oh, that's right! What's the name of Ariel's fish in that movie if the crab is Sebastian?
The fish's name is Flounder.
I remember now! I need to watch that movie again soon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney Movie?
The original Beauty and the Beast
That is a great movie, I love the talking candlestick!
Yes, he is great, but I must admit Chip is my favorite!
Did you know that they have an extended version of it on DVD?
No, what are some of the different scenes?
There is a musical scence where the castle creatures sing about wanting to be human again!
Interesting, I think my favorite part is when the beast reveals the library and you can tell that Belle is starting to fall in love with the Beast
My favorite part is the be our guest dinner scene!
True, that is a great scene, especially the try the grey stuff!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Do you wanna build a snowman?
Absolutely not. I'm too busy trying to make a man out of you.
Then why don't you go on and kiss the girl?
Because hakuna matata?
What's that mean?
Hakuna matata? It means no worries... for the rest of our days.
Such a wonderful phrase.
All day and all night, 24/7, on land, in the air, or... under the sea.
I love how we can just randomly quote Disney movies and songs all day. You really get me.
Duh! That's why we're best friends, silly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Sleeping Beauty was the last animated Disney fairy tale until The Little Mermaid?
That can't be true.
I read it on Disney's website. There was a 30 year gap between those two.
Wow, I can't believe that. Why?
I guess it was because Sleeping Beauty didn't do too well in theaters.
That's a long time between movies though.
It definitely is. Especially for a classic fairy tale like Sleeping Beauty.
You said The Little Mermaid was the one they did right after Sleeping Beauty?
Yes.
That's crazy. 30 years is a long time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go to the movies with me on Saturday?
Sure, I'm not doing anything. Is there something special you wanted to see?
Uh, it's not what I want to see. It's what my 6 year old nephew I'm babysitting wants to see....
Oh Lord. What's the movie?
It's Disney's new movie Cars 3. He loves Lightening McQueen.
Okay, that's fine. I love Owen Wilson, and he does the voice for Lightening McQueen.
My nephew loves the Cars movies, he has a Cars bedpread and toys and everything. I promised I'd take him while my sister and her husband go to a wedding on Saturday.
Well, since I'm single, I'd rather go to a Disney movie than go to a wedding myself and have to watch all the happily in love people.
I know, right?! And of course we can pig out on popcorn and candy from the concession stand.
All right, tell your nephew he has a date with both of us!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you get the meaning of the balloons in the movie Up?
Yeah, they were the way the house flew up in the air.
Yeah but it seems like they're everywhere in every advertisement for the movie.
Well yeah, they should be. They're kind of important in the story.
Well why don't they have that funny dog in every advertisement? He's pretty important.
Yeah, but he's not all that important.
A talking dog? What could be more important than that?
I guess you have a point.
Maybe they should start calling the movie: Dog.
I doubt they'll do that, dude.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Mine would have to be Toy Story. Maybe even all 3 of them.
I honestly would have to say mine is also Toy Story.
Yeah, there are a lot of great Disney movies, but Toy Story just really hits home and makes you feel like a kid again.
Speaking of being a kid again, do you remember watching Mickey Mouse when you were younger?
Yes, I loved that show, I even watched it when it was in black and white.
Haha, back in the day I watched Dumbo, the movie about the little elephant.
Really? I loved that movie, I watched that and The Jungle Book over and over!
Do you remember the song from the Jungle Book?
Yes, haha. Bear necessities those simple bear necessities.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wasn't Zootopia hilarious?
It was so good! Not one false note.
Jason Bateman was perfect as the fox.
Yeah, shades of Arrested Development there.
And the little rabbit policewoman. Too funny!
She was cute. And effective.
Don't think they had a lot by way of music going on.
Just the comedy.
Wonder who wrote it.
Well its definitely a keeper.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Timon and Pumba were a good influence on Simba?
They were only after pleasure
I think they helped Simba grow up. But they didn't know anything about being a lion
Simba was a boy when he ran away
By the end of the movie, they had had more influence on him than any of the lions
They made him feel better after losing his dad
They did a good job at representing what the animals would really be like. The lions were at the top of the food chain.
Yeah, but they aren't an actual king that the other animals care about
Simba would have a hard time adjusting to the savannah
He was seen as a leader after he had been gone for way too long
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Old time Disney - it would be Sleeping Beauty. That was a groundbreaker in animation back in its day.
What about a contemporary favorite?
It would have to be Aladdin. That film just had everything perfect.
Kind of bittersweet now, since Robin Williams has passed.
I'm grateful for films like Aladdin that captured Robin when he was at his peak, doing what he did better than anyone else in the world.
He certainly made the Genie a unique and memorable character.
He was so topical with his improv riffs that you need to look some of his references up to understand them! But that makes Aladdin a kind of time capsule as well as a great movie.
It was fun to find out that Robin could sing, too. I guess he could do anything.
He will live forever, thanks to Aladdin and all of his other wonderful work on film and TV. I'm glad for that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Disney character as a kid?
I never really liked the human characters as a kid, so I think it must have been Simba.
Really? Mine was Aladdin.
That is a real rags to riches story.
What about any that aren't the protagonist.
Hmm. Cruella DeVille was a really good villain.
Yeah. But so was Jafar.
It sounds like you just really like Aladdin!
I guess I do!
We can watch it later, if you want.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the new Beauty and the Beast movie with Emma Watson?
To be honest, I didn't really care for it.
Really? Why not?
Well, Belle is supposed to be the most beautiful girl in the entire village.
Okay.. And??
Well, I don't find Emma Watson to be all that beautiful.
Why not? I think she's very pretty.
Oh, I don't think she's ugly. But there were tons of people throughout the movie that are more attractive than her.
Well, she's a popular actress so that's probably why she was cast for the part. She's also a good actress on top of being well liked.
Yeah, I suppose that's true. I was just disappointed, is all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the LIon King?
It has great pictures and visuals
What do you think about Simba as a tragic hero?
He was the hero, his tragic flaw would have been running away
He might have been murdered if he had stayed
Yes, but his thinking hurt him, believing that he caused Mufassa's death
Scar was very manipulative, but Simba looked up to him
Simba still could have been murdered when he finally returned and almost was
So some of Simba's tragedy was not his fault
Simba didn't have the emotional maturity to be king for a while
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love watching Behind the Scenes for Disney films.
I do too. It makes you really appreciate the time and dedication they put into their work.
For sure. And some of the scenes they share are funny too.
Are you talking about the classic Lion King?
Haha, yeah - with the 3D model of Mufasa's death.
Oh my god, yeah! The voice acting was so serious but the animation was so stiff!
That's what made it hilarious! Scar's neck and arms were stretching across the cliff when he was threatening Mufasa.
Right right! And then Mufasa's model just tumbled down into a river of still antelopes!
Then Simba's face was stuck making that "ah" face!
Haha, that was too funny. Almost uncanny, really!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the scene in Lilo and Stitch, where Lilo made a sour jar?
The one where she stuffed all three of her friends in the pickle jar?
That's the one. Did you notice the title on the book beside her?
I think it was Voodoo for Beginners.
What's hilarious is that her friends all have these nice little dolls, and hers is a Voodoo Doll!
I liked it when she said "My friends need to be punished", and in the jar they went.
Lilo and Nonnie are all sorts of messed up, yet they have such a typical sister bond.
I really like how that one was done.
Me too. It shows that not all kids have a perfect childhood.
Also shows the coping skills they can acquire. I think this is the only Disney movie that shows how the parents die.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Inside Out was such a great animation film.
I thought the tones of it were amazing.
The actors in it played their roles perfectly.
Disney does a great job lining up voices and really making it work.
The tone of the conscience now versus back then made me think.
Those are the best kinds of films.
I was not expecting it to be so quick.
The movie flowed amazingly well.
I think they should definitely do a sequel.
Sometimes you have to leave well enough alone though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Aren't you excited about the upcoming Star Wars movie, The Last Jedi?
I am. December can't come soon enough!
With stars like Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher coming back again to play their characters Luke and Leia, you know it will be a great movie.
Yes, but not only those two but all of the other characters and the continuation of the saga.
Star  Wars is one of those franchises that we can ever get enough from.
It has been around for almost 40 years and counting. And it gets better with  every sequel.
George Lucas is a genius. The movies just keep getting better and better.
They do. My boyfriend told me we have to do a movie marathon for a plot refresher.
I can't wait to see this movie.
Me either. Its a must see for me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get a chance to watch the live actions Beauty and the Beast remake?
Yah I watched it. I didn;t really care for it unlike everyone else in the world.
What!? It was exactly like the original. What was wrong about it!
The songs just felt so artificial and there were too many of them!
Yah they did add some unnecessary song in there. I walked out on the Beast's song to use the bathroom.
And the moving objects looked creepy especially the wardrobe with its dead eyes.
Wasn't the dress scene amazing though! Emma Watson looks gorgeous in that iconic gown.
She did I'll admit, and that scene was done well. But everything in that movie I liked better in the animated version.
What about the Gaston song? They added more to it compared to the original.
I don't know! I guess I just was not feeling the whole movie. It could just be me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what would be one of your favorite Disney movies of all time?
I would have to say the Toy Story movies are definitely some of favorites.
Those were great. Didn't they make several of them?
Yes. They made three of them..
I wonder if they'll ever make another one.
Actually, Toy Story 4 is scheduled for summer of 2019.
Oh, wow. I wonder if Tom Hanks will do the voice of Woody again.
He is, apparently.
Cool. Do you have any idea what it's suppposed to be about?
Apparently Woody and Buzz Lightyear go on a search for Bo Peep, who was given away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you enjoy Peter Pan?
It was magical
What part did you like the most?
When they fly to Neverland
That is a great part
Did you like Captain Hook?
Yes, especially when the alligator chased him
Yeah I loved that part too
What about the lost boys?
They were awesome
XXXXXXXXXXX
My girlfriend said the weirdest thing yesterday.
What was it?
She reckons "The Fox and The Hound" is the best Disney movie ever made.
Well she's right about that.
What?
That film taught me about friendship and also about the inevitability of outgrowing childhood friends.
That's so bleak.
No, it's also got important messages about accepting people's differences.
Doesn't the hound kill the fox in the end.
Nope, Copper saves Tod from being shot, because despite their differences, they will always be best friends.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know John Carter was a Disney movie?
No, was it really? I loved that movie.
I do too, I wish I could jump like John Carter.
I love that he choose the woman at the end, it was so romantic.
Taylor Kitsch is so good looking and he has a nice personality.
Yeah, that movie made over 284.1 million at the box office.
It is ridiculous how much it cost to make a movie so they deserve how ever much they make.
Disney makes the best movies and not just animated ones, which is great.
I know Below Eight, Freaky Friday, Remember the Titans, and the list goes on and on.
My grand-daughter's favorite is The Princess Diaries.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't think disney wants to admit that cars 2 was a thing.
Cars 3 wasnt so bad, I never saw 2 though.
It was basically a spy movie with cars in it.
Thats very weird.
I know right?
When you think about it, the whole cars world is a bit unsettling. What was disney thinking?
Well disney is the king of personification, so they did what came naturally.
Yeah, but a whole world of cars? Do you think they had a car world war?
Oh jeez I didnt think of that.
Was there a car holocaust? They world may never know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What type of Disney film is your favorite?
Do you mean animated or live action?
Yes, or a combination of both like Mary Poppins.
Oh, yes.  I loved Dick Van Dyke as Bert and his dance with the penguins is a classic!
Or Pete's Dragon.  What a star filled movie.
I loved Mickey Rooney as Lampie, Nora's dad.
I do think Popeye was my favorite though.
Oh, yes.  Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelly Duvall as Olive Oyl was surely one of the best of this genre!
The animated films are truly the stars of Stars of Disney in my eyes though.
I agree - Alice in Wonderland will always be my favorite - book and original film!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite movie?
I really like the Lion King! I watched it all the time as a kid, and I just saw it on Broadway last month!
That was the movie with the baby lion that was friends with the warthog and the meercat, right?
Yes! They adopted the baby lion, Simba, after his uncle killed his dad.
Heavy stuff for a kid's movie!
Yeah, but there were some great songs. I liked "Hakuna matata!"
That is a good one! It means no worries, for the rest of your days.
Yes! And it made "The Circle of Life" such a classic song. Once you hear it, it's stuck in your head forever!
Is that the song that plays at the beginning of the movie?
Yeah! When the sun is rising over Mufasa's kingdom.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the most impactful animated movie in your life?
Honestly, it was probably Lilo and Stitch.
That's an answer I didn't expect.
I just loved the friendship they shared. I also loved the way they designed Stitch.
I'll agree Stitch was a great character idea.
Between his design and his voice, he's instantly unique.
His voice was really cute. One of my friends can recreate it perfectly.
Yeah, and he had a bunch of super abilities.
Oh yeah. Wasn't he super strong?
Yes, and fast. I thought it was a good break from the princesses at Disney.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Zootopia?
you mean the movie inside of which a bunny trying to make friends with a fox?
yes
I think it was okay. Over all, it's simply too simple and childish for adult to watch
why is that?
I mean there are some good value in it, but I just don't see how a bunny can make friends with fox
that's kinda true
I think it's better for movies to lead kids to a direction that reflects reality, not completely away from it, one day they'll learn the hard truth
well, you covered it all
did I say too much?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your least favorite Disney movie?
My least favorite are any of the movies where a parent dies.
That is a lot of Disney movies. Bambi, Dumbo, Lion King, Frozen and I think a few others I'm forgetting.
Yeah, it seems to be a theme. Bambi made me really sad when I was a little child.
I understand. The Lion King used to make my little brother cry every time he watched it.
I bet most of the main characters from Disney are missing a parent.
It's a sad trend. My brother enjoys Disney movies and he cried a lot when he was a kid because of things like that.
Wreck-it Ralph and Zootopia are kind of sad too but in different ways.
Wreck-it Ralph is pretty upbeat.
Yeah, nothing too sad happens at least.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movies are your favorite?
I love the Lion King and Snow White.
Me too but Frozen is my favorite.
Yes, I like how the love story is about sisterly love, not romantic.
I agree!  Anna is my favorite character.
I like Elsa.
What other Disney princess is your favorite?
Ariel, although I also love Mulan.
Yes she is a strong female character.
I like her because she is still strong.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like Frozen?
I liked the sisters. I thought their relationship was believable.
Elsa was kind of mean to her sister.
Sisters are like that. She was trying to protect her, plus she was literally the ice princess.
Anna literally sacrifices herself for her sister, as an act of true love.
It never would have worked if she knew that was what she had to do.
I liked that they deceived the audience into thinking it would be the kiss.
I agree. I was expected the Disney trope of the true love kiss.
Olaf was a cute character. His Sony about summer was hilarious.
They had to put in comedic relief from what's a pretty harrowing story otherwise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long has it been since you're seen the movie Aladdin?
Much too long.
I watched it again recently in remembrance of Robin Williams.
Oh yeah, he played Genie didn't he?
Yep, one of my favorite characters.
I think my favorite character had to be Jafar.
Why Jafar? He's a bit of a creep.
Imagine having that amount of magic! Obviously I'd use it for good and not to get young princesses to marry me.
You better not!
Cross my heart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you musical movies?
Not really, however Disney movies are an exception.
Oh, is that so ? Which song is your favorite ?
It's actually a tie between two songs from the same movie.
Which movie and what songs?
The movie is "The Lion King". And the songs are "Hakuna Matata" & "I can't wait to be the king"
What is so good about them?
" Hakuna Matata" means no worry in Swahili , It is almost my motto , I don't worry about things  and have a chill atitude.
what about the other one?
The beat and lyrics of " I can't wait to be the king" are really upbeat and the childhood imagination is really great about it .
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw 101 Dalmatians.
The cartoon or the live action movie?
The cartoon, 1961.
Who directed it?
Wolfgang Reitherman, Hamilton Luske, and Clyde Geronimi.
Who was Pongo?
Rod Taylor.
And Perdita?
Cate Bauer.
I loved the song Cruella De Vil.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Haven't you watched Finding Dory yet?
No, i'm dying to, how was it?
It was awesome, Disney really scored a perfect 10 with this one.
Really? Even more than Finding Nemo?
Well, I loved Finding Nemo, but i think this one has more characters which makes it more interesting.
Does Ellen still do Dory's voice?
Yes, and i think she's pretty hilarious.
I know, Dory is actually my favorite character.
Oh, Dory is so loveable.
I know, i can't really wait to see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the movie Beauty and the Beast when you were a kid?
Yes!  I went to the theater to see it.
So did I!  My mom saved up and was able to take me and my sister.
I went with my brother and he hated it.
Oh?  I can't believe someone hated Beauty and the Beast.
Granted, he was on the verge of being a teenager.  He didn't have time for a love story, I guess.
Oh, that's really funny!
The best part is now he's an adult and has to watch it with his kids.
Does he still hate it?
No, he told me the first time he watched it with his son, he cried.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Disney movie Fantasia?
I do, it's so different from all the other Disney films.
It's so beautiful. For a movie that came out in 1999, the graphics are still incredible. So is the music.
What's your favorite scene?
I like the butterfly scene with Symphony No. 5 by Beethoven.
That's a great part. The colors and contrast of light and dark are awesome.
What is your favorite scene in Fantasia?
I like the awakening of the Firebird. That scene was intense.
It was cool. Angela Lansbury introduced that scene.
I didn't know that. I hated that the forest was destroyed, but the Sprite came through in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new beauty and tge beast movie.
No the original was my absolute fave growing up.
Yeah im not sure I would like anything but a cartoon version.
Right and I heard there was a lot of controversy
Yeah something about somebody being gay ir something
Everyone has a problem with something
Its harder to tell those things in cartoon
I dont know if I like disney doing real life movies of classics.
Yeah they should stick with classics
I will still probably watch it though
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think that the romance in Lady and the Tramp is the best Disney love story of all time.
You mean the best Disney relationship is between two dogs?
Yes! The way they give each other puppy dog eyes. It kills me.
They are awfully charming.
And the way they share that meal. It just touches my heart.
A romantic dinner will do that to a person.
Lady is so demure. And then she embraces the Tramp with all of his unruliness.
It's a special kind of unconditional love.
We should all aspire to find the Lady to our Tramp.
Or the Tramp to our Lady.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the original Alice in Wonderland by Disney?
I've seen Alice in Wonderland, but I don't know if it was the one you are talking about.
Yeah, there are so many versions of the story.
Yeah, but I think Disney really popularized it as a movie.
They probably did.
I'm sure the one I saw was the original.  It had the look of it.
Didn't Disney redo Alice in Wonderland recently?
Yeah, I think they did.
I actually didn't see the newer one.
I didn't either, but my sister said it was awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
People forget Remember the Titans was a disney film
I forgot that it was to be honest.
It was a great story.
Denzel Washington did great in his role.
Oh for sure he acted the heck out of it.
Do you think it was the best sports movie of all time?
It is up there, especially with the cast.
I loved when they united the team.
It was based on a true story.
I know and I couldnt imagine going through that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Brave?
I loved the story.
Yeah, the characters were very memorable too.
Yeah, I really liked the witch.
It was too bad she was only in it for a bit.
I don't mind though. I like characters that pop in only for a scene.
I thought it was really cool how she just disappeared and her house was empty.
That scene was very cool.
Did you like the ending?
Yes, I am glad her mom turned back into a human.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you prefer the first monsters inc or the second one?
Do you mean Monsters University?
Yes, that's the one.
Well, I actually liked the second one better.
Not a lot of people think that because Boo isn't in it.
Oh I know, I remember when Monsters University came out and everyone was confused because she wasn't in it.
Yeah, I can say the same. It made more sense when we found out it was a prequel.
Good point. I was glad that some of the originals characters were in it though.
I agree.  It would be Monsters Inc. without John Goodman.
Or Billy Crystal.

Lets talk about disney movies
Awesome
I love cinderella
The classic?
Yes
My favorite classic is beauty and the beast
That one is so good too
They both find their princes
Exactly
Love them

I was listening to the radio today and heard that Disney costumes are the most popular halloween costumes these days.
I believe it! Last year my boyfriend and I went as Meg and Hercules from Hercules!
What a small world, that is what my sister and her husband are doing this year! And their new baby will be dressed as Phil!
That is hilarious!
Come to think of it, it's been a while since I've seen a couple costume that isn't Disney! I know a lot of little girls always go as princesses.
I agree! Especially since the new Beauty and the Beast movie came out, I think that will be a popular one this year.
You're right, my little cousin has been demanding to get a Belle dress for Halloween and it's only June!
Hey, maybe I'll get a Belle dress and you can be Cogsworth or Lumiere!
Oh goodness! I think maybe you should have your husband dress as Beast and you can be Belle.
If you aren't calling dibs on Cogsworth, I'll get my dog a costume!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the Jimi Hendrix reference in Cars?
When Sarge was raising his flag?
Yes! When he told Filmore to turn that disrespectful stuff off.
Respect the classics, man!
That was hilarious.
One of my favorite scenes.
The hippie and the Military man.
Yet, they are best friends.
In their own way.
Cars is filled with great moments like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder what Disney movies will be released on dvd this year?
Oh, you mean the ones that are from the vault?
Yes, I try to purchase them as soon as they come out.
Well, let me grab my phone and do some googling for you.
Thank you so much for doing this.
It seems the latest release was Bambi and it was two weeks ago.
I haven't gotten that one, yet.  I think I need to go to the store now.
Yes, that is all the vault releases for this year.  In January, Pinocchio was released.
Yes, I have that one.
Then, it seems you are all caught up for the year as soon as you get Bambi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some of your all time favorite Disney movies?
I have a lot I would say the Toy Story ones.
I like those who is your favorite character?
I like buzz light year.
I like woody.
Yeah i love his voice.
His character is awesome how he acts.
Who is that actor?
I think it is Tom Hanks.
He is a good person to play that part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen many Disney movies recently?
I watched Moana a short time ago. That one was all right.
I haven't seen one of their animated efforts since Frozen.
That one was great.
I really liked it too. It was a bit different from the normal formula and just well done all round.
Some of the ones that came before it were mixed bags, like Tangled and Brave.
I liked Tangled, but Brave was just not very good.
That one was just weird. It started being about one thing, and ended up somewhere completely different.
Yeah, it was a little disjointed. Did you hear there's a Frozen 2 on the way?
I hope it's not horrible like most Disney sequels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about Disney getting hacked in May?
No, what happened?
Some cyber thieves stole one of Disney's new movies coming out. They want a ransom in bitcoins, or they're going to post it on online for people to steal.
So is Disney paying the ransom?
No, they are insisting they won't pay ransom. Someone already stole 10 episodes of a Disney tv show and posted it online.
What movie did they steal?
Disney wasn't saying, but they had Pirates of the Caribbean and Cars 3 coming out soon.
I bet it was Pirates of the Caribbean. There would be a bigger audience for that than a kid's movie.
Probably. Johnny Depp's character in the Pirates movie is pretty popular.
They probably would like that it's a movie about pirates, stolen by online pirates.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss black and white cartoons
They were pretty rad
I mean the silent humor was cool
Silent?
The first ones had no sound
Well now i would like sound
But But
The black and white ones with sound were cool
You dislike the silent ones
Yeah i do
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw The Shaggy Dog.
A Disney classic?  What year?
1959.
Who directed?
Charles Barton.
Who was the kid that turned into a dog?
Tommy Kirk
From Old Yeller!  Who was the dad?
Fred MacMurray.
Who was in My Three Sons, later.  Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movies have female lead characters?
There's for sure a bunch. The Little Mermaid, Pocahontas,  Frozen, Inside Out.
Wow, I hadn't realized ther ewere so many.
Yeah, they do a pretty decent job at balancing things.
That's good, I think it's important for girls to have role models.
Yeah, I think that Riley from Inside out is a great role model.
Why?
She has such a health relationship to her emotions.
I see what you're saying. She experiences them all in a way that's balanced.
Exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So which do you think was sadder, The Lion King or Bambi?
Wow, tough questions! They're both tear-jerkers.
I feel like in The Lion King it's more unexpected when Simba's father dies.
Maybe so, but both of them make you cry.
They're both great movies, too.
The animation in The Lion King is a lot more sophisticated.
True, but Bambi is still worth watching.
Oh, definitely! And Thumper is still funny.
Honestly, the two movies have a lot in common.
They're both about nature, and about the circle of life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like Sleeping Beauty?
As in, the princess or the movie?
Both, I guess.
The Princess is okay, the movie is....also okay.
I barely remember the movie, to be honest with you.
That's because not much happens, she's asleep and then she wakes up.
It's one of the less climatic movies of Disney.
Agreed, so much more could've happened.
Well, at least her pink dress looks nice in the movie.
Sure, she had good fashion, I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Disney movie song?
Yes, Under the Sea from the Little Mermaid. I can play it on the piano.
Great song, when did you learn it?
Quite recently, which might surprise you give that I'm thirty years old.
That is slightly surprising.
What's your favorite Disney movie song?
That's a tough one. I have two from the Lion King.
Hakuna Matata has to be one, right?
Yes, Hakuna Matata is one and the other is "I Just Can't Wait to Be King."
Wow, I forgot about that one. Great song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My kids are making me watch Moana over and over!!
I know, mine too!
Mine love it more than Frozen!
Mine too!  Especially that song "You're welcome".  They now sing it to each other instead of saying it!
That's so cute!
It would be, if I wasn't sick of the song!  There could be worse things though.  I really do like Moana.
Me too! I love it when she finally returns the heart.
That's my favorite scene!
Mine too!! And when she turns back into Te Fiti she is so beautiful!
Yes she is. The colors are so vibrant in that movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the classic beauty and the beast
Me too
Belle is so classy and elegant
She is, i enjoy watching her
And i love how the beast goes from closed off to caring
He made some real changes
It is such a heartwarming movie
I couldnt agree more
Its the best movie
I love it
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Moana?
I thought it was well put together, if not a little cliche'.
I liked Maui because at first he's like, I'm the greatest, thank you very much, but then changes so that he's helping of Moana.
Yeah, me too, even though he left her, he came back when she really needed him.
I was sad when Moana's grandma died.
Yeah, but Moana was better for having known her and believed what her grandma taught her.
Moana's dad was a big jerk at the beginning of the movie.
But, he was afraid that Moana would get hurt; he was just protecting his child.
I'm glad Moana followed her heart, though, because her people were better off because of it.
Even if we're afraid to strike out and do what we were made to do, when we do it, everybody is better for it.  Wait, was that the moral of the story?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Treasure Planet?
What an amazing film!
Truely. Martin Short has never done better.
Who was he?
The robot.
That was a funny character.
Who played Silver?
I'm not sure, but he did a heck of a job.
A movie is only as good as its villian.
Too true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you recommend me a cartoon that would be interesting for an adult as well?
Yes, I just saw Inside Out recently and I loved it!
What makes Inside Out so great?
It depicts how emotions work inside our heads and I think it is quite psychological.
What kind of emotions is it about?
Its main characters are Joy, Fear, Anger, Sadness and Disgust and they all live in a girl's brain.
Does the movie have good ratings?
Yes, I think its IMDB user rating is 8.2 which is very high.
And will my 7-year-old son also get the movie?
Yes, my daughter who is 6 laughed a lot during the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Frozen?
I thought it was OK.
Yeah I believe it was a little overrated.
Just a little?
Well some of the stuff was just too much.
There was alot of singing.
But I thought it could have been better.
Well maybe they are doing a sequel.
Its Disney they definitely are.
They did make a ton of money off of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The first time I saw Up I was full of such emotion.
Oh I know because you didn't know what to expect.
At first I was happy and laughing for the first bit.
Sure and then you start to see the plot develop.
And before you know it you are crying. I don't think I made it through the first 10 minutes without crying.
It was so sad when the wife died. I cried too.
It was awesome though when the balloons start to rise up from the house.
Yeah, and the nurses from the old age home just stare in amazement as it floats away.
It had a great ending. I really liked that Carl learned to get over his sadness and became an important part in Russell's life.
Yes, Carl became like a grandfather for Russell who needed a good father figure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish I had a magic carpet. Like in Aladdin.
Yes! And a magic lamp as well.
Of course! That way we could have a genie to grant us our wishes.
I would love to get a few wishes granted.
And Jasmine is so pretty in that movie.
She really is. She's one of my favorite Disney girls.
The soundtrack is so much fun as well.
Most Disney soundtracks are amazing.
And Robin Williams was great as the genie.
That he was. May he rest in peace.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Tarzan is the brother to the princesses in Frozen?
No way!
Yes way, they even got people from Disney to speak on it.
I can't believe that. Isn't he in the jungle though?
That's what I thought. But maybe they just sailed really far away.
I guess so. They don't have the same coloring though.
Well, I guess Tarzan just got really tan.
I wonder if they'll ever make a movie where Tarzan and the princesses meet.
Hmmm, that'd be interesting to accomplish.
I'd definitely go watch it though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Disney princess movie came first?
I believe it was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Oh, okay. I never really liked that one too much.
Why not? Some of the songs are decent.
Yeah, but the story never really interested me too much.
It's a little bit duller than some of the others, but you have to remember how revolutionary the animation was.
I guess that's true, but it doesn't mean I have to be a big fan of it or anything.
I know. I just appreciate it for what it was.
That's cool. I respect that.
Plus, I like to whistle while I work!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
The little mermaid. I love the story and the soundtrack of that movie.
Yeah, it has some really good songs. Which one is your favorite?
Kiss the girl, from the scene where Ariel and prince Erik almost kiss during their boat ride.
Oh, I remember that scene. Romantic and comic at the same time.
Yeah, I love how Disney movies can express so many different emotions at the same time. And their stories usually have a good message too.
I think the message of The little mermaid would be that true love is worth sacrificing for.
I agree. It will always be my childhood favorite.
What was your favorite character in the movie by the way?
Ariel, of course. I adored her long, red hair and her amazing voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How was the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
I haven't seen the new Disney one yet, just the older animated Disney one.
Oh, okay.  I heard good things about the new live action one.
With Emma Watson?  The previews looked good.
Yeah, loved the sets. Emma Watson makes a good Belle.
I think so too. Is the new version a musical?
I think so, like the animated one.
Wonder if it has the same songs.
Its hard to say.  Looks like they spent a lot of money on it.
Very true.  I'm excited to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch disney movies
Of course
You know which ones i like?
Which ones?
Halloweentown
Me too, i watch them every year when they come on
They are really good, and i love the supernatural element
Me too
They are fun movies
I want thwm to come out with another one
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where do you think the writers came up with the idea of 101 Dalmations?
I don't know. Maybe it was a book or something.
Maybe it was, but what about that author?
Maybe that author loved dalmations.
Well you would have to love dalmations a lot if you wanted to have 101 of them.
Yeah 101 is overkill, but 100 is just right.
Haha what a joke!
I can't even begin to imagine having 102, like in the next movie.
Don't even get me started.
How about 101 Beagles?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Dumbo?
Yes, but it is sad.
Yeah, there are many sad moments in that movie.
My favorite is Alice in Wonderland when it comes to Disney.
That is a good one.
It takes you away into another world and I love that idea.
That is quite an old cartoon.
Yeah, the old ones are the best.
Who is your favorite character in Alice in Wonderland?
Alice of course.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seem Bambi before?
Oh yes, my mom took me when I was really little.
I saw it on video.
I was really young and got so upset about the fire and Bambi's mother getting killed.
Yeah, that was pretty bad at that age.
I also had a record LP that came with a book and when you heard a tinkling sound you were supposed to turn the page.
What was the point of that?
It was as if the record was telling you the story and the tinkling sound had you follow along with the pictures.
I'll bet that would be a collector's item now.
No doubt, but we sold it at a garage sale years ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The Nightmare Before Christmas?
No I haven't! What's it about?
It's a Disney movie about Holidays colliding.
That sounds interesting, is it animated?
It's an older stop motion animation movie from the 90s.
Oh, I didn't realize it's been out a long time. What happens in it?
Well the Pumpkin King, Jack Skellington, is like the ruler of Halloween. It starts out on Halloween night, but Jack feels like something is missing, so he tries to take over Christmas after discovering a door to Christmas town in the woods.
So he becomes like a scary Santa Claus?
Yeah pretty much. He has Santa kidnapped and hidden while he makes crazy and scary toys to hand out to boys and girls on Christmas morning and Santa ends up having to fix everything in the end. U
Wow, that sounds like a good movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favourite Disney movie?
Hmmm, it's hard to pick. Maybe Mulan?
Mulan is my favourite Disney Princess for sure but I don't know if it's the best movie they've ever made.
What would you pick?
I think probably Moana.
Eh, I'm not such a fan of the newer 3D ones.
Yeah but Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, come on.
He was in it?
Yeah, he's like the second main character.
Huh. Maybe I'll give it a go then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Had you ever seen the original Adventures in Babysitting?
I didn't know there was an original.  Was it good?
I loved it as a kid, but I didn't like it as much when I watched it again.
Oh, that sucks.  Should I even bother?
I guess.  There are some funny parts to it.
I guess you thought it was funnier when you were a kid.
Probably so.  Was the newer one any good?
It was okay.
That doesn't sound promising.
I guess neither one was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I woke up this morning and on TV was the Disney movie "The Incredibles"!
I love that movie!
Me too.  Might be my favorite Pixar Disney movie!  I love the story and the animation!
Sometimes I feel like retired Mr Incredible.
Me to.  At least we don't have to worry about a evil villain chasing us.
I don' t know. My boss can be that guy sometimes!
I think anyone can relate to that.
Did you know there is a 2nd Incredibles coming out soon?
I had read that on the internet.
A whole generation will have grown up almost before the 2nd one came out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, Disney was really good at making me cry growing up.
I know! They had a lot of tear jerkers.
The one that always got me was the Fox and the Hound.
In the scene where she leaves him in the forest? I cry every time.
Even the Best of Friends song will make me tear up when I hear it.
Oh, me too. I can't even play the first notes without my brother yelling at me to stop.
I always wished Todd and--what was the dog's name?
Copper,  I think.
That's right! I always wished they could have been friends in the end.
Me too; it's a shame they had to leave each other because of their positions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your least favorite Disney Pixar movie?
Most of them are really great, but the Cars series, 1 and 2, haven't done much for me.
Yeah, I am mainly perplexed by the premise of the movie.
Same. Kids like cars I guess?
That's true.
I wonder how well Cars 2 did at the box office.
Google says 562 million dollars.
Wow! A half billion dollars from a movie.
It's super impressive.
Yes, although, it's also super impressive how much they spent making it. 200 million!
XXXXXXXXXXX
DId you like the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
I'm not really sure! I love the original so much.
I know what you mean. That movie is my childhood.
I really loved the way it looked though. I also loved all the background that you got in the new film that you didn't get in the original.
I agree. The background on her mom was pretty cool.
I also thought the enchanted objects of the palace were beautiful but I kind of missed the animation.
But, the live action movie had Emma Watson!
I know! I liked it. Really, I did. But, I will always like the original better.
I think I liked the live action one better.
I totally get that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know Oprah did a voice for a Disney ?
Really, which one?
The Princess and the Frog, she was the voice for Edora.
That was a cute movie, wasn't John Goodman a voice in that one too.
I think he was the voice for Big Daddy' La Bouff.
If I was a celebrity I would do voices for cartoons. I think that is so cool.
For sure, look at Toy Story with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.
Oh my goodness it had so many celebrity voices in it like Don Rickles, Anne Potts, and John Ratzenberger.
I did not know Don Rickles did a voice, what character was he?
Mr. Potato Head isn't that fitting?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I just bought a new Disney movie. Do you want to borrow it?
No thanks, I am not a fan of Disney.
I thought you are a fan of Pirates movies?
I don't seem to recall any disney cartoon character that is a pirate beside Captain Hook and I am not a fan of Peter Pan.
I am talking about Pirates of the Caribbean, my friend.
Oh, I love that show! Are you sure it is a Disney movie?
Pirates of the Caribbean is produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films.
I don't know that! Do you have the on with Chow Yun-Fat in it? I am his fan!
Of course, you can drop by my place later to pick it up.
Great! I'll see you later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you go see another fox and the hound movie?
I loved it, i think so!
The character of Copper was so cute.
Yeah I loved how they bonded at the end.
They never did a sequel right?
I cant remember.
Yeah maybe I should look it up.
Those kinds of heart warming movies are the best ones Disney does.
I agree with you, they can touch your heart.
The fox though was a little nerve wracking at first!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney flick?
Toy Story, for sure.
That was Pixar.
Disney owns Pixar.
Huh, seems like they trying to monopolize the movie industry.
They are a veritble Goliath.
How they've chaged since I was a kid.
Yeah, for better or worse.
In some ways better, some wasys worse.
True that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do yoou know that there are a lot of mistakes in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?
What kind if mistakes?
When Snow White bakes a pie, at first it's round, but in the next scene it's flat.
I never noticed that.
When the dwarfs start singing Hi Ho, they just suddenly appear in an empty mine singing.
I'll have to check that out.
Another mistak is that Dopey slams a door shut, then suddenly the door is back open.
You  really know a lot of trivia.
I watched a video on YouTube that pointed out the mistakes.
I'm going to look for that video.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best Disney villain?
Jeez, there are a lot of good ones.
Disney does villains well.
I like the ones you still sort of want to root for.
Like Maleficent?
In the cartoons?
No, in the animation she was just pure evil. In the live film, not so much.
I liked her in the live one.
So, who would you say then Mallificent.
I would have to go with, yes, live action Mallificent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's you favorite Toy Story movie?
I think each has it's good points.
Yeah, the first was groundbreaking. Our first look at 3-D animation.
I was spellbound when I first saw it.
The second is such a joy, especially because sequels are usually bad.
Toy Story 2 was almost better than the first.
Seeing the relationships develop and following the story of Woody and Buzz was great.
You're not lying!
And let's not forget the songs!
Randy Newman is extremely talented.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Polly, did you see then new Disney version of The Jungle Book?
Yeah.
What did you think?
It was ok.
Just "OK."  Didn't you like it?
Oh, I liked it. The story was good, and the visual effects were really nice, but I was dissappointed that there was no music.
Yeah. I seel what you mean.
Not that is was bad or anything, buI want to be like you ooot I jut like my Disney to have some singing in it.
Yeah. What's Jungle Book without a singing bear?
Right!  "I want to be like you, oo, oo..."
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney character?
There are many good ones. My favorite would have to be Mushu, Mulan's sidekick.
I don't remember Mulan having a sidekick.
Mushu was the red dragon.
I remember now. He was funny.
Not only did he provide comedic relief, but he was there for Mulan when she needed him.
Why is he your favorite character?
Mushu makes me laugh. He also reminds us that no matter your position in life, you can be there for others.
For a small dragon, he played a large role.
I think his heart was bigger than he was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you ever watch romantic disney movies?
i didnt even know that disney made those
yeah movies like lady and the tramp
oh i think ive seen that, who were in that?
it focused on the two dogs that met and kinda fell for each other.
now i remember, and the owners also fell in love?
i think so, it has been a while since i last watched it
yeah same here, i liked the scene with the noodles the dogs were eating
Me too that scene is so memorable
Agreed i think everyone likes that scene also.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm trying to decide if I should see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Do you know much about it?
No, not really. I haven't seen it yet, either, but I have heard it's good.
Hey, if it has Johnny Depp in it, that's all I really need!
But is Orlando Bloom in it?
Yes, he is, but I'm not sure how big his role in it is.
I think Keira Knightley has a small role in it as well.
Any idea what the plot is about?
I think it's related to Will Turner's son somehow. Not quite sure how.
Okay. I might have to go see it then.
Hey, mind if I go with you to see it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
That movie is so annoying
What one is that annoys  you
That frozen movie
Why is it annoying
Because of that one song
What one
The one saying let it go or something
But that one is cute
No it is annoying
Well now i know what to sing
XXXXXXXXXXX
So after watching Frozen the millionth time with my daughter, we tried Moana.
Mo anne-na. I heard good thind about it. What did you think?
It's Moe-Anna. Like Anna from Frozen. I made the same mistake too. It was great!
What did you like about it?
It featured a strong female character, had wonderful catchy tunes and one crazy chicken that made me laugh.
Always have an animal sidekick. Disney movie rule.
Is Timon & Pumba considered an animal companion cliche? Since, well Simba was an animal?
Umm, sure why not!? They brought that comic relief that the companion always has.
I agree. Maybe since they are lower on the food chain as well.
I like bacon.. Yup.. Yup..
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think some movies are annoying
What kind
Kids on in particular
Why
I think Disney movies just agitate me
Thats not good though
Why not
Because everyone loves Disney
Not me
Well  that is weird
XXXXXXXXXXX
James and the Giant Peach was one of my favorite books
I know, I was so happy when the movie came out.
I felt so bad for how James was treated though.
I know, I was thinking about how he had lost his mom and dad and now he is being abused.
I wonder if that peach tasted good being that it was so big.
I know, also because it had giant bugs all through it
I liked how he lived in the peach seed in the end, that was neat.
right in the middle of the city also!
I was glad that he got away from his horrible aunts.
so was I , he deserved to be happy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Aladdin?
Yes
I heard an interesting theory about it
What is that
That is could be in the future
How is that
They have magic like genies and flying carpets that could be just technology
It would be a post apocalyptic future then
It does seem to lack some modern conveniences. Also, the genie knew about some recent device despite being in the lamp for hundreds of years
That's a cool theory
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the animated Beauty and the Beast better I think
Not me, I have parts of both the animated and the new one I really like
So are you saying you couldn't pick a favorite?
Probably not easily. I mean, they are not even both the same type, like both cartoons or whatever.
I guess I see your point, I just grew up watching the old animation.
So did I, and I love it, always will. The new one just brings the story to life in a whole new way for me.
Oh I will agree with you there. Some moments I was just ear to ear grinning and right on the edge of my seat.
I will admit, and maybe it's just my age, but I don't see myself watching this one as many times as I watched the animated as a child.
True, but like you said, probably more of an age thing, we don't have the time anymore.
We should make time, have a disney movie night.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you checked out Avengers?
Yes, with all those super heroes around, it was on my 'to watch' list before its release.
Well then good news for you, as Avengers: Infinity War is on the cards?
When does it release?
As per the initial reports around April 2018.
That seems to far and a long wait.
You haven't heard it all. It is a two-part movie.
What?!! Do part 1 and 2 release together?
No, so far I know only about part 1 releasing in April 2018
Reminds me of Harry Potter's last book and movies which were divided into two parts. A long wait then for part 2.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I don't really have a favorite, but I pretty much like anything that Pixar has made.
I heard Cars 3 was very good.
It was definitely the best in the series.
I really liked the Toy Story movies.
That is probably my favorite animated series of movies of all time.
It's amazing that the sequels are just as good as the original.
The characters in the movies are some of the most memorable of any movie.
Buzz Lightyear and Woody's interactions are funny for both kids and adults.
The fact that they throw in some adult humor here and there is what makes those movies so entertaining.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Disney princess?
I know i'm in the minority, but I just love Aurora from Sleeping Beauty.
I do love that movie, especially because of Prince Phillip.  But my favorite princess is Belle.
Beauty and the Beast does have some of the best songs.
I love Cinderellas dress though, and those glass slippers were to die for!
Belle's dress is pretty amazing too, but yellow is my favorite color so I am a little biased..
Jasmine had a pretty cool outfit too, even though it wasn't really a dress.
All of her outfits were amazing!  Plus she had a tiger so she was the best.
Out of the princes, Aladdin was definitely the best.
He was my favorite too! Even though he wasn't technically a prince.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like disney's cinderella?
I did. I really love gus, the chubby mouse.
He was a cute character. Adorable voice.
The cat from that film was iconic to me too.
I think his name was lucifer, good bad cat name.
Ya  it was.. I loved when he walks across the floor with his muddy paws.
You feel so bad for cinderella there, but got to love how well it displays his character.
Agreed. I mean in the end she gets the prince and all is good.
True. Do you recall the song they dance to this is love? I think it is such a beautiful tune.
Yes, that was my friend's wedding song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you noticed how much Disney movies have changed over the last several years like Frozen, Brave Etc?
What do you mean?
It is no longer about the princess being saved by a prince, but now they are showing strong independent women.
This is true, I never thought about it.
What do you think about the change?
I think it was a great idea.
Why?
Because society has changed so much since Disney first started making movies.
What do you mean?
Women are more independent, and while we all love a good love story we don't need to always see the man being the savior like in Brave
XXXXXXXXXXX
My students are obsessed with the Disney movie Frozen?
Oh yeah? I feel out of touch, I know nothing about it.
Well, this is one of the benefits of teaching. You stay hip to the young people stuff.
That's 100% true. What's Frozen all about?
I don't actually know, but they're obsessed with one of the songs from the soundtrack.
Would I know it?
Possibly. It's called "Let It Go" and it repeats that refrain many times.
That's honestly not ringing a bell.
You'll have to visit my classroom sometime soon.
Only if you're screening Disney movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are your kids still into Frozen?
Well, they are starting to get out of it.
Mine still watch it everyday.
Wow, that's crazy.  I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, my brain is about to burst.
Mine would too.  I don't want to hear any of those songs as it is.
Yeah, hopefully it slacks off.
Well, all that's gonna happen is something new is going to come along.
You are probably right.
Yeah, we are stuck.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get to see the new Disney movie "Cars 3" that came out this year?
I totally did I thought it was awesome!
So did I. I love the message that is was sending about having a strong sens of community and also that winning is not everything if it is at the expense of someone else's well being.
Totally! It really honed in on the whole deal of moral values. We sure need a big dose of that these days.
Indeed. These are the kids of messages I think that really need to be instilled in our kids.
Hey I'm a big kid too (chuckles) but you're absolutely right. That's why I'll take a Disney Movie any day.
I loved how they showed that sometimes you really have to loose to win.
Yeah and sometimes based on what you do to win you end up being a Looser!!
They really stressed the need and the value in a strong sense of community which I think is lacking today, in a world that is so self oriented.
Totally, we need each other and it is when we have a sense of community we could build something awesome. Yay Cars!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I got all misty eyed this morning when I was flipping channels.
Why, what's wrong?
Nothing, really. Just thinking back to when the kids were small.
I get it. Was a kid show on?
Winnie The Pooh and the Hundred Acre Woods.
Your son loved Pooh, didn't he?
Yes, we put the movie in every night at bedtime.
He used to sing the songs didn't he?
Yes he did.
I remember all the stuffed Pooh Bears in your house.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the  movie Brave?
The one with Merida?
Yes
That was quite good.
I thought it had a good story for teaching girls to be brave.
And making them stand up for themselves.
Yes and she was really good with that bow and arrow.
Yes she was!
Disney makes some great movies!
And a lot of money!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just can't believe it!
What?
They are remaking Mulan.
Oh, I haven't even seen the original to be honest.
Really?  It's really good.  You should watch it instead of the live action one.
I will check it out.  Remakes usually make me really mad.
Yeah, especially if it's really bad.  It disrespects the original.
I think it's weird to remake cartoons, but this is Disney we are talking about.
They will remake anything for the mighty dollar.
It's a shame.  Let's just hope it's good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw an older Disney movie the other day that I hadn't seen in a long time.
What movie was that?
It was Oliver and Company. I forgot how good that movie was.
I remember watching that when I was kid.
It was a classic when we were younger.
I liked that Billy Joel did some music for it and Bette Midler too.
Did you know Joey Lawrence did Oliver's voice?
Really? I didn't know that. He was really young then.
Yeah. Hard to believe that movie came out so long ago.
I wonder if they will ever do a sequel to that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have heard people say the Gargoyle in Hunchback of Notre Dame is really Pumbaa from The Lion King .
People are mistaken. That statue actually exists.
Like in real life at the cathedral?
Exactly if you went to paris and saw it in person you would see it is a real life gargoyle.
But maybe that is what inspired  the looks of Pumbaa from The Lion King
Well what year was lion king out?
I think 1994 was when Lion king was released.
So that theory can't work because  hunchback was in 1996.
Unless the creators were already aware of the statue and maybe got inspiration for it prior to hunchback's release.
That could be. The cathedral was standing long before lion king.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know of any new movie releases coming up?
I have heard of a few but they are probably the same ones you know.
A recent one I know is Guardian of the Galaxy.
Yeah I have heard of that one, it was released in May.
Yeah it was May 5, 2017.
Yeah I knew it was somewhere around there.
There is also a Toy Sory 4!
No way! I love those movies.
Me too and it just released June 6.
We have got to see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is better, Atlantis or Treasure Planet?
Oh, Atlantis for sure.
I have to disagree. I much preferred Treasure Planet.
Atlantis was so much cooler! They had all the technology.
They had technology on Treasure planet. So much tech.
But Atlantis had the cool blue glow, and the folklore.
The characters were much more likeable in Treasure Planet.
There were evil characters in both movies you can't base it off of that.
Treasure planet is still my favorite.
You can think that, but Atlantis is better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Disney sports movie?
Yes, the best is definitely D2: The Mighty Ducks.
That's a great one. I love hockey and I remember that movie making me want to play so much when I was younger.
What about you? Do you have a favorite Disney Sports movie.
Jamaica we have a bobsled team!
Cool Runnings?
Yes, Cool Runnings!
Definitely one of the funniest Disney movies I've seen.
Oh yeah! The humor is great and it's a movie that the whole family can watch.
That's what I love about Disney films.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish I could be shrunk like they did in that movie from Disney.
Which movie is that?
Honey I Shrunk The Kids.
Oh yeah. That was cool how it looked when they were running in the grass.
Yes, but creept too, with the ants.
Yeah, actually it was.
No I mean to be able to sneak anywhere and not get caught.
Yes but look how many times they almost got crushed.
A mad scientist father who creates a shrink machine.
Well, only in a Disney movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the movie Alice in Wonderland? It's my favorite Disney movie.
I think that's a great movie! Old, but great!
Yes, it was made in 1951. Kathryn Beaumont voiced Alice's character.
Ed Wynn was the voice for the Mad Hatter. He was hilarious!
To be honest, the Mad Hatter annoyed me.
Why?
He was really crazy. His character was too much for me. I liked the white rabbit.
Tweedledee and Tweedledum were great. Oh and the Cheshire Cat!
Yes, the Cheshire Cat was awesome. I liked how he'd disappear.
Everytime I see a flamingo I think about the game of croquet...
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your Favorite Disney movie?
I have to say Frozen.
Why do you like Frozen?
I just love the story and the singing.
What is your second favorite disney movie?
I also love Hercules.
Yes, that is one of my favorites as well.
Who is your favorite character?
I would have to say Phil.
Yes! He gives the movie a great sense of humor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, I really liked the Moana movie.
Oh I know right?  Hawaiian culture is so nice, I looked it up.  There was a lot going on in the back scenes.
How do you mean?  In terms of making of the movie?
Exactly.  They went to Hawaii, researched legends, spoke to the people, and got their input and contribution.
Ah that is nice!  It's really great to experience different cultures every now and then!
Tell me about it.  The fact that each country and nation is distinct from one another, it's so great.
I totally agree.  You know, if there were no countries/nations, we wouldn't have any Disney princesses right?
Yup!  And I'm totally looking forward to the next Disney princess!
What culture should they focus on next?
Well, whatever it is, I'm sure it'll be amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw The Jungle Book last night.
The cartoon or the live action movie?
Cartoon, 1967.
Cool.  Who was the voice of Mowgli?
Bruce Reitherman.
Who is Baloo?
Phil Harris.
Who was the panther?
Sebastian Cabot.
I loved him in Family Affair.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Disney incorporating songs into their movies again?
I think it is a great marketing strategy to interest old and new generations.
I agree!
With Frozen it has been very effective.
Frozen was all I heard about for months.
They are coming out with a second one too.
I know! I'm looking forward to it.
That's what is amazing about those movies. Adults love them too.
I guess that's the magic of Disney.
Very true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen 'Frozen'?
Thankfully not - I'm sick of hearing that 'Let It Go' song everywhere.
I know how you feel. It's crazy Disney is still making hits, though.
Disney is timeless. You can still watch an older Disney movie and it stands up to the test of time.
I watched 'Beauty and the Beast' for the first time since I was a kid and the animation is gorgeous.
It's amazing what they were able to do decades ago, and it still looks beautiful.
'Alice in Wonderland' is still an amazing feat of animation.
That's definitely one of my favorite Disney movies. The scene with the Queen of Hearts and all the cards is so scary!
I remember feeling claustrophobic and panicky when I saw that scene as a kid.
Me too. Disney movies just really stand up to the test of time, in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
That's a tough one, if I had to pick a favorite it would be Aladdin.
Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, I like that one, too.
What about Snow White or Cinderellla?
I liked those, but they weren't my favorite, my favorite is Aladdin.
Have you seen the Emporer's new groove?
Oh, yes, that's my second favorite, It's hilarious, Kronk cracks me up.
Yeah, I like the squirrel scouts thing with Izma.
Haha, Yeah, Squeaker Squeak Squeakin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the very first Disney movie you ever saw?
I do! I saw Bambi at the drive in movie theater.
At the drive in? Wow, that's cool.
Yeah, I remember how cool it was. I loved the short movie clips they played before the movie too.
They are starting to bring back some of those too.
I noticed! I saw an old time Mikey Mouse clip last time I went to the theater.
How fun! I just love how things have evolved.
It gets better every year. The 3D Disney movies are my favorites now!
I saw Toy Story 2 in 3D! I absolutely loved it!
I wish it was easier to watch 3D movies from home. I love them, but don't like the price tag at the theaters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Disney will every make another Fantasia?
Oh, I hope so. I really liked the first two.
What was your favorite part?
Oh mine must be a tie between Mickey casting a spell on the broom and the flamingo with a yo-yo.
Those were funny ones.
What was your favorite part?
Definitely Rhapsody in Blue from Fantasia 2000.
That's such a good part! My family watches them every year around christmas.
That's such a great tradition, I'm going to start doing it.
You can join us!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Disney movie growing up?
The Lion King!
Oh, that's a good one.
Wait, I really liked The Little Mermaid too...
Yes, that one was my favorite- along with Aladdin.
A whole new world!!!
Hehe, the best karaoke song!
All those movies had the best songs to sing along to.
Right!? I used to have my sister write out the lyrics for me because back then it was only dial-up Internet.
Oh my gosh, we are so old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Another one of my favorite Disney movies is Hercules.
I like that one too. It has a great story line.
Yeah. I love the story between him and Megara especially.
It is so romantic how she sacrifices herself to help him.
I also liked the character Hades. He is a funny villain.
True. James Woods does good with the dry humor for his character.
Plus the music for Hercules is really good.
I liked the song Hero to Zero.
Really? my favorite one was I won't say I am in love.
All their songs are good honestly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Oh, that's a hard one. There's just so many classics!
It doesn't have to be just classics either, it can be some of the new ones they put out.
I think for me, it would have to be Inside Out for the new ones, and Mulan for the classics.
Interesting! I'd have to agree with you on that.
I think Mulan was just so different from the other princesses and Inside Out is a movie everyone can relate to.
I loved the animation from Inside Out, it was very pleasant to watch. Even my kids loved it.
I feel like it would definitely call out to children!
I like that Disney is sending positive messages to little children and making movies they can relate to.
Not only that, but adults can enjoy them too! That's when you know it's good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think a modern Ariel would feel about humans? Compared to how they were before?
I don't know, I think mermaids would find humans in general to be gross.
She loved their culture and creations that they didn't have underwater.
But would she love everything else now?
Haha, her riding in a carriage was a riot, imagine her in a car.
Or a plane!
Her mind was blown when she found a telescope, imagine how she'd react to computer.
We see in the sequel she loves her life as a human though.
That's true.
Modern Ariel would be a riot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know when Avengers Infitiny War is coming to the theaters?
Im not sure but I think it has a long time still.
I heard it was coming out in 2018 I just wasnt sure when.
Oh that would be great I really want to see that movie.
Yeah! I want to watch it too it looks really interesting.
What are your favorite heroes?
Mine are Captain America and Thor what about yours?
I really want to see Iron man he cracks me up.
Yeah he is pretty funny, hopefully this new Avengers movie will be pretty great.
I heard its the last Avenger's movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Little Mermaid movies?
No? I thought there was only one.
Nope, I definetely have seen the direct sequel
Oh, well whats it called?
I can't remember, but in the movie Ariel has a daughter with black hair.
Of course, she would look like Prince Eric.
Yeah, exactly, and they have drama like mothers and daughters do.
That doesn't suprise me, sounds interesting though.
Yeah, I actually like the music in it.
Well I'll have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite DIsney movie couple?
I don't think so. Do you?
I like Aladdin and Jasmine.
Oh yeah, they're pretty cute together.
Remember when he goes up to her balcony on the Magic Carpet dressed like a prince?
Yes! When she tells him to go jump off a bridge or something and "falls" off the balcony ledge onto Carpet below.
Yeah, and then that leads into that beautiful song...
"A Whole New World"!
Yes! Didn't you just want to be on that magic carpet ride?
I would still jump at the chance!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Beauty and the Beast in theaters?
Yes, when I was a kid.
I saw it when I was a kid too.
Did you see it when they released it for a couple days a few years ago?
Yeah, wasn't it in 3d?
Yes, it was
I also saw The Lion King in 3d
Cool!
Do you like Disney films in 3d?
Yes, it adds depth for me and I get to experience it in a new way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your all time favorite Disney movie?
That's a tough one. Of the older ones, I'd have to say the Aristocats.
I loved that one too, but I'd pick The Jungle Book.
Both of those have great music. What about more recent movies?
I love all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and Frozen and Moana were both must sees too.
And Finding Dory. I was surprised by that one.
I was too! I really didn't expect to like it.
Ellen DeGeneres is great.
And the plot was good too. I was really afraid it was going to be a bad knockoff, but it was fresh.
Yes. I'd even watch it again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Inside Out is Disney's deepest movie yet.
Why do you think that?
Well, it looks at all the human emotions and puts a classic disney twist on it.
That's true, but what about the movie The Chronicles of Narnia.
Why was that movie deep?
Well there were tons of symbols in that movie that everyone was talking about.
Yeah I guess maybe that could be a prett deep movie as well.
It might even have more symbols that Inside Out!
Maybe we should watch the both of them again. What do you think?
Sure, how about tonight?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite DIsney princess?
I really like Jasmine!
Why is she your favorite?
Mainly two reasons. First, she looks most like me--long dark hair, you know?
That makes sense. What's the other reason?
She's independent with some spunk--like how she's not going to let anyone tell her who to marry!
So true! I think Pocahontas is like that too.
How so?
She listens to her heart and makes decisions she believes are right, instead of just listening to other people.
So true, they are similar in that way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like disney movies?
Yea, generally.
Is it because you have kids?
No, I don't have kids, I just really like the animation and music.
Yea me too! It's nice not being judged for that.
It actually is inspiring me to draw more!
Really? That's great! It inspired me to become an animator, and my sister to become a voice actor!
That's amazing! Do you have a favorite?
It's too hard to choose! I'll sing along to any of them!
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy watching disney movies?
I love them
Have you seen camp rock?
That was a good movie
I enjoyed all the songs
I did too
And demi lovato was good
Shes a great actress
Amd pretty
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favourite Disney movie?
I think the Lion King is my favourite.
That movie is my favourite as well but I also really enjoyed Bambi.
Bambi is such a sad movie but The Lion King is also pretty sad.
Many Disney movies have sad parts like Frozen when she accidentally hurts her sister.
Did you like the Frozen movie?
I did. It is my favourite modern Disney movie.
I don't usually enjoy the singing in Disney movies but I liked the singing in Frozen.
The singing was very good. I think it is my favourite part of the movie.
I hope the new Frozen movie has lots of great singing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think there should be a new lion king for future generations.
I feel that the original is good enough for all generations.
I think they should make it so mufasa doesn't die.
But that ruins the whole premise of the plot.
No, I just feel they can go in a different angle beside killing off a father.
You are crazy. Nothing is wrong with the movie.
The movie is great it just can be better.
Nothing is better. It's a classic.
Classics can always get redone.
You have the right to your opinion
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish I was a cat so I could spend my night playing jazz piano.
Like the Aristocats?
Yeah doesn't everybody want to be a cat.
Yes, because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's hat.
Everybody's picking up on that feline beat.
Because everything else is obsolete.
Haha, it seems we are already on our way to becoming Aristocats.
Yeah I'd be a tomcat and you'd be a scaredy cat.
Ha ha you're so funny. Anyways I'd definitely be Scat Cat.
Well I'll be Toulouse then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
Snow White
Oh, wow!
Yea, It's old, but good!
I agree!  What's your favorite part
Probably the end
Makes sense - all is well in the end
Exactly!
She ends up better off than the beginning even!
True true!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you find Underdog funny?
The premise of it was great
Having a dog superhero was too funny
Jason Lee played that role
Yeah its hard to imagine
Wasnt Peter Dinklage in that too
Yes there were quite a few actors in it
Patrick Warburton was definitely in it
Yeah the plot was absurd so they loaded up with stars
I think Brad Garrett was the funniest out of all of them
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get to watch the live action version of Beauty and the Beast?
Yeah, I did! Emma Watson was awesome!
Yeah, she was great as Belle. The new songs were not bad at all, either.
They fit the expanded storyline, but I still kind of like the old stuff better.
I know what you mean. It was cool to see a bit more backstory.
You know, I think I remember the Beast's past being expanded on in the Christmas special but not much of Belle's past before she came to whatever town they were in.
She mentions having moved there, in the original. Also, Gaston had a bit of a job change. He was a hunter in the original and he's some kind of soldier in this one.
And LeFou, too! They changed him a bit, he's kind of...quesioning, I guess?
I guess. They still did really well with it overall.
True, true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite song from Frozen?
For me, has to be Let It Go.
I knew you were going to say that.  Everybody says that.
Okay, wiseguy, what about you?
I'm a bit different.  I prefer First Time in Forever.
Nothing wrong with that song.  It was quite lovely.
I actually preferred Kristin Bell's singing over Idina Menzel.
That's some pretty heavy praise.
Just sounds more natural to me.
I disagree, but respect your opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which disney film has the best musical score?
I say Aladdin. there is gotta have a friend like me, whole new world.
Whole new world is such a good one. I love singing along to it.
I also really loved the opening market song in Aladdin. So entertaining.
Aladdin is a good call, but I think Lion King had a stronger soundtrack.
I do also think that is a top choice.  Circle of life is amazing.
It is so deep when you think of the message, and so very true.
Lion king was incredible for so many reasons. Original story as well.
Musically it is my favorite. Can you feel the love tonight won an oscar even.
Elton john is a pro. Disney was so wise having him in on this film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I could watch Tangled every day of my life!
It is such an underrated movie!
I am Rapunzel! I just need the magical hair now.
Could you imagine having magical hair!
And having Flynn Rider being your boyfriend?
His smolder is the greatest.
And having little Pascal as a buddy.
I love the lantern scene when they are in the boat.
My favorite is when she is reunited with her family.
Yes, such a happy moment.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I have always been partial to Aladdin.
That's a great classic Disney movie.
It has some of the best songs, too.
Did you see that the voice actors did a version of A whole new world 20 years later?
I did see that, it sounded exactly the same.
I always liked Jasmine. She was a strong character before that was popular.
She does seem ahead of other Disney princesses of her time.
She still used her body to try to distract Jafar.
That was creepy, but also necessary.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember when you first saw The Little Mermaid?
Yeah, I love that movie so much.
I always thought Ursula was such a fantastic villain.
She was definitely one of the more memorable ones.
She was big but still beautiful and had that sinister smile.
Yes! I wonder if we'll ever get to see her in a live action remake.
I can't believe they haven't done that already.
I wonder who they would cast as Ariel.
It would have to be a very careful decision or people would be upset.
You're right. Those are some big, nostalgic shoes to fill.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you just love the Muppets?
Oh yeah.  I loved the Disney film The Muppets with Amy Adams.
Oh it was sooo cute. Good story too.
Right.  Restore the Muppets to their former glory.
They got the team back together!
With some newbies.
Oh like Jason Segel.  Mmm hmm.
Who is your favorite muppet?
Kermit of course!
Mine is Miss Piggy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Frozen?
I did the first time I watched it...
But you don't like it anymore?
Not since I've heard Let It Go at every single birthday party I've been to.
Oh, me too. I still love that song though!
Ugh, I am so tired of it. I hope the songs in Frozen 2 are less catchy.
I bet they'll be even more popular than Let It Go.
Impossible! Every kid on earth knows that song.
I just hope they get Idina Menzel to sing it again.
True. She's the only good thing about that song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love disney movies, what about you?
Yes they are great
They are so fun
I love the old disney movies?
Which ones?
The lion King, aladdin, beauty and the beat
Those are classic.
They are and nothing beats them
My all time favorite movie is beauty and the beast
Thats one of my favorites too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your third favorite Disney movie?
I like Dumbo the little elephant.
Why do you like sad ones?  Dumbo was one of the saddest that made me cry.
Dumbo was sad but it was nice that he made friends with the other circus animals.
What happened to Dumbo's mother?
His mother was locked up in a cage for awhile.
Dumbo had big ears and could fly correct?
Yes, that was part of his act.
Did Dumbo escape from the circus?
He did escape at the end.  I think he flew away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
winnie the pooh is one of the best movies
he is such a cute bear, did you know the writer made that about his own stuffed animals
he was, he was always finding honey pots
I wonder why bears love honey so much
because it tastes so good!
I like tigger, he was so crazy jumping around
and little roo, he was always following tigger
i know and poor rabbit with his garden always getting ruined
i know, rabbit was a boy i always though rabbit was an old lady
so did i , then my mom said rabbit was a boy
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey mom, what is a good movie?
Honey, I'm busy. Go watch Alice Through the Looking Glass.
Oh, the movie with Johnny Depp? I heard it was a flop.
No honey, it was good, okay? The time guy was very cool looking.
Wow Mom, do you have a crush on him?
Yeah, if I was Alice I would steal the time orb, and try to get the time man to marry me.
I like the mad hatter.
Yeah, because you are a little bit mental.
Do you still love me?
Yeah, I guess so...Go watch the red queen, that's my mood right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the latest Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, very much so.
How did you like it compared to the original?
I liked the original better.
Why did you like the original one better?
It was my favorite childhood movie.
Do you think the original means more to you because you were a child?
Yes, it brings back a lot of my favorite childhood memories.
Do you think the latest Beauty and the Beast will be enjoyed by children today?
That's hard to say, but if I had to bet, I would say they would enjoy the original better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like any Disney movie?
You want animated or live action movie?
Tell me about a live action movie.
I really love the Pirates of the Caribbean!
Oh! I too love Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.
Haha! he is so funny sometimes tear come out of my eyes on seeing his antics.
Which part do you like the most ?
I liked the first one best it's "The Curse of the Black Pearl".The story was so fresh.What about you?
Well I liked "At World's End" the most, it had the most action scenes and I'm a big fan of action.
Okay! To each his own I suppose.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember when Lion King was made?
I'm not exactly sure but I think it came out in 1994.
You're probably right. Can't believe it's been that long!
I know! Makes me feel old.
Another one I watched regularly as a kid was Aladdin.
Oh I loved that one also, so good.
Did you enjoy the Return of Jafar too?
I did but it was not as good as the original.
You're right, I prefer the original too but I did enjoy Robin Williams voice in those movies.
I really did too! His character was perfect.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember the movie, 'Wall-E?'
Of course I remember.  It was such a great movie.
I saw it again the other day.  I forgot how satirical it was.
Which were some of the satirical elements that stood out to you?
I thought that it was really biting, especially about consumerism and environmental concerns.  How about for you?
I liked the elements you mentioned, and I also liked that they addressed the concerns of obesity.
I forgot about that one.  I can't believe a children's movie was that complex.
Isn't it great?  I love that movies like 'Wall-E' and other Disney films are great for people of all ages.
That is a sign of great writing.  Speaking of, do you know who directed it?
It was directed by Andrew Stanton.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whenever I watch 101 Dalmatians, I end up wanting to get another dog.
I know! Me too!
And I get so angry at CruElla. Who could be that mean to animals?
She's a classic Disney villain, isn't she?
Yeah, she has to be one of the worst with her stupid fur coat.
She's a terrible person with even worse fashion sense.
Could you imagine having that many dogs though?
Imagine the dog hair getting on everything!
I think owning over a hundred of any animal is a bit crazy.
You've got that right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe it's been so long since Snow White and the Seven Dwarves came out.
It's astounding, isn't it? It's such a classic Disney movie.
Totally. The dwarves are my favorite part of the movie.
Which one is your favorite?
I like Bashful the most because it's so cute when his cheeks get all red. What about you?
I like Doc because it is so funny when he can't find the right words to say.
I think it's cool how each dwarf had a different personality yet they were all so sweet, even Grumpy.
I know, and they were all heartbroken when they thought that Snow White had died.
I wonder if they ever visited her at the palace after the prince woke her up.
I guess we'll never know. At least she gave them all a kiss on the head goodbye.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you ever see Mulan?
No, never heard of it
The one about the Chinese princess
Still doesn't ring a bell.
You should check it out. Has some funny moments.
I think I might pass
Eddie Murphy is the voice of the dragon
Really? I didn't know that
Yes, a good showing by him
Hmmm, maybe I'll have to check it out now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I went this weekend with my kids to see Cars 3. They love it!
We wanted to go and see it but we didn't make it. Lighting McQueen is my son's favorite Disney character.
All my kids love him too.
Did you see it in 3D? How was it?
Yes we did. It was fantastic. We really enjoyed the animation, the effects and the plot of the movie.
What is it about this time around?
I don't want to give away the plot, but the message in this Car's movie is one that really will help children believe in themselves.
That's a good message for kids now a days.
Yes is it, and the best part is that the whole movie revolves around believing in one self. Which is amazing.
You can never go wrong with a Disney Pixar movie. They are the best. We will definitely be seeing this one next weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is better, Pixar or Warner Brothers Animation?
That's easy man. Pixar is Disney and Disney makes all classics.
Can't we say the same about Warner Bros. animation?
They've made a number of good movies, sure. However, Disney/Pixar has Toy Story, Inside Out, Finding Nemo, Finding Dory, Monsters, Inc., the Incredibles, WALL-E, and so many other classics.
Yeah, I guess you're right. You just named a bunch of great movies and didn't even mention Cars, or A Bug's Life, or Up.
See? Disney Pixar has so many great movies.
Do you know who was associated with Disney Pixar?
Specifically? No.
Steve Jobs of Apple fame.
Really? I had no clue!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite moment from Fantasia?
Cal me old fashioned but the Sorcerer's Apprentice part always gets me.
Is that the one with Mickey and all the brooms?
Yea, I think it's a classic.
Yea definitely. That part always stressed me out as a kid. I was always a big fan of the dancing hippos.
In the pink ballerina outfits? I loved them.
I cannot watch it and not laugh.
Yea they were hilarious. They were big but they could definitely move.
I wish I could stay on my tip toes like them.
Yea I never thought I'd wish to be as graceful as a hippo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe Frozen is getting a sequel?
Yes, yes I can. Everything is getting a sequel whether it needs it or not.
Is that really such a bad thing though?
It can be, but as Finding Nemo and Finding Dory has proven sometimes they can get it right. Though as The Little Mermaid 2 indicates... not always.
Frozen was insanely popular forever so I'm honestly not surprised either. Haven't seen the first one yet, but hopefully it's not one of those sequels for money's sake and they can actually do the original story's feel justice.
I'll give Disney the benefit of the doubt as they've been pretty consistent in recent years with both their live action and animated films.
There any sequels you ARE looking forward to being released?
Actually, yes. The Incredibles 2 and Wreck It Ralph 2 in 2018 then Toy Story 4 in 2019 but I have mixed feelings and concerns about that one.
I noticed there were some untitled Pixar films coming out from 2019 to 2021. I wouldn't mind if one of them was a sequel to Inside Out.
That or another Monsters or Finding whatever would probably be good if they can keep the momentum they did with their prequel and sequel films. Was quite pleased with how Monsters University and Finding Dory turned out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Tarzan Disney Movie?
Yes, I watched it with my daughter last night.
That was good wasn't it?
It sure was.
I love the part where he's sliding on the trees to the Phil Collins song.
Yeah that was the best part.  I like when he saved Jane from the monkeys.
Yeah, great movie.  Or how about when he defeats Clayton?
That was good.  Guess we know who the real animal is.
I know right?
Over looked part.  When he let out the Tarzan call after killing the leopard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I love Mulan, she is such a strong lead female character.
My favorite Disney movie is Hercules.
Hercules has a great soundtrack - I love the song "Zero to Hero."
So does Mulan - "I'll Make a Man out of You" is amazing!
I agree, I love all the Disney songs.
Have you seen any of the recent Disney movies?
I saw Frozen when it came out but not since then.
I really want to see Moana.
Let's go to the movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the animated movie Tarzan?
Sure it is a pretty good one.
Do you know who was the voice of the baby ape Terk?
Wasn't it Rosie O'donnell?
I am not sure but whomever it was I think it was my favorite character just because of the voice.
I am not sure I understand, what do you mean?
All of the disney characters seem to have a predictable voice.
Like low and gruff for a villain and high and melodious for a heroine?
Yes but Terk's voice was gravelly and hit the punch lines with just the right tone that it sunk in for me.
I will have to rewatch it so I can hear what you are talking about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What DIsney movies are out?
I know Cars 3 just got released.
Oh, fun! I loved the first one!
Me, too. My kids have always loved watching the first one.
Mine, too. But none of us like the sequels.
Nah, but the third one is getting really good reviews.
Maybe we'll try it. It has to be better than Captain Underpants, right?
I would think so! Let me know how it is.
I will. My kids will probably be quoting it for weeks.
Speed? I am speed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney song?
"Under the sea" from The Little Mermaid.
Oh I forgot about that one!
How could you forget about it? Sebastian is the best.
He's pretty great, although I think Flounder was my favorite character.
Flounder was pretty cute. I had a stuffed flounder doll when I was a little girl.
Me too! I slept with that thing all the time. I thought he would help me ward off Ursula.
Ursula was so creepy.
Yea and those ells that she had were gross too.
I actually thought they were kind of cute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you buy Beauty and the Beast yet?
Not yet.  I'm trying to not let my daughter know it came out yet.
Why's that?
I would rather wait for the Blu-Ray to get a bit cheaper.
How much is it at Target?
$25 I think.  Seems expensive.
If you want, you can borrow my copy.
It's okay, I'm sure we'll get around to it.
Alright.  Besides, you know she's going to watch it about a billion times once you get it.
No joke, don't remind me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Disney movies or Nickeldoen ones better?
For sure Disney. They make better feature length films.
What do you think about the whole princess genre ?
Like Snow White and so on?
Yes the princess cartoons.
I loved the old ones. The way they hand drew the animation in Snow White as well as Cinderella .
I like the music in them.
Disney has a real good way of making these catchy songs.
I still find myself singing the themes from Hercules the Disney movie.
Oh, that one was so underrated.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw something spectacular in the theater
What was it
I went with my niece to see that new Disney movie
Yeah?
And the movie was amazing
Was it?
Much better than i had anticipated
What were you expecting
Something bland and boring
It was not?
XXXXXXXXXXX
How often do you go to the movies to see a Disney movie?
Usually every one.
Yeah theres something about their films.
They do them so well.
Which one is your favorite?
I really loved Frozen
I think the dialogue was excellent in that film
The singing too.
Well yeah that goes without saying.
I cant wait for the sequel!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favoirtie Disney movie?  Mine is The Lion King.
I like that one too.  I really like Timon and Pumba.
Did you know that they are based on two characters from Hamlet?
Really? Who?
They are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
That's right.  That movie has a connection to Hamlet.
Which Hamlet character do you think is Rafiki?
I'm not sure. I don't think it follows the story that well.
I guess Scar is Claudius.
Yes, and Mufasa is the old king.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever just think about Disney's classic Cinderella?
Yes, I do actually.
Imagine talking to animals, or thinking that you're talking to animals.
I wouldn't mind having birds and mice that are tame enough to let me dress them up.
That would be adorable, wouldn't it.
I wouldn't want to talk to animals if it meant I had to live with that family through most of my adolescence.
That's true but I supposed at the end of it you end up rich and with someone who wants to take you away from it all.
Even then I don't find it worth it.
You know what's really not worth it, those glass shoes. That would hurt!
No kidding!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that movie on the disney channel?
Which one?
The one with the girl who can control the boys with her smartphone
Oh the movie with Zendaya in it?
Yes
That was a wierd movie
Yes it was
Who would think a malfunctioning phone could ever do that
Exactly
It would be cool though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite classic Disney princess movie, Cinderella or Snow White?
I think definitely Cinderella.
What about the dwarves in Snow White, though? They're so funny!
Yes, but I love the mice that help make Cinderella's dress.
Okay, they were pretty great.
Plus there's the romantic dance at the ball!
Yes, but Snow White's prince gets to wake her up and save her life.
That's true, and the evil witch is a great Disney villain.
Cinderella gets a great dress, though!
And she gets to wear the glass slippers. That's my favorite part!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana ?
No I haven't yet, what's it about?
I don't know much about it , but it is based in Hawaii.
Wow, that sounds interesting.
Oh , and one more interesting thing.
What's that?
It has got "the rock" as a main character
really , It has Dwanye "the rock" Johnson in it?
Yeah, the one & only.
Oh my god! I have to see that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Isn't Bambi a sad movie?
Do you really mean the cartoon?
Yes, the Disney movie.
Guess I never thought about it.
Bambi loses her mother to a fire. How sad.
Yes, it is. There is a lot of tragedy in Disney movies.
Yes. Like all the Princesses that lost their mothers too.
Bambi does make a lot of good friends though.
Every movie does have a moral to the story.
Yes and Bambi overcomes it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I didnt know mary poppins was a disney movie
I didnt know that either, whered you hear that?
I just looked it up.
Well then thats now my favorite disney movie of all time
I love that movie.
Me too.
I wish they came out with a second one back then
Me too
If they tried to make another one now it wouldnt be good
Probably not
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the first Disney cartoon movie?
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
When did that come out?
I believe it came out in the 30's.
Wow, that was a long time ago.
Yes and it was a huge success.
What was the second one?
I'll give you a hint. He had a rather large nose.
I'm not sure.
Pinocchio!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Finding Nemo?
Yes
Better than Finding Dory?
Yes, I thought it had a better story.
Do you know the director?
Yes, Andrew Stanton.
He also did Wall-E.
Yeah, he is a good director.
I love the Disney Pixar films.
They always deliver great films.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What disney movie do you really like?
I love the movie Dumbo.
Oh yeah that movie is super good.
I miss it, I need to watch it again.
What other disney movies?
I like the lion king a lot.
I love that movie too, such a classic.
I also like Wall E.
Oh I have not seen that.
Make a point to, it is amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i need some more Disney stuff
Hm
Well Disney movies
What about them
I need more of them
Why
Because they are awesome
Well they are good
For sure they are
Yep
XXXXXXXXXXX
Am I the only one that didn't like Monsters Inc?
I'm sure there are others.
I just thought the movie had a good concept, but got old quick.
I don't think it got old, but preferred the kid not go into the monster world.
The plot was just bare.  Trying to make kids feel fear, I get it.
It was interesting how they built an economy around it.
I just don't think destroying a door would somehow prevent you from going back.
It is a kids movie, you know.
Still, I would have expected better.
Be sure to write Pixar and let them know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is one of your favorite Disney movies?
I have to say Beauty and the Beast.
That movie is a classic.
Who is your favorite character from that movie?
I really like Lumiere.
Yes, he is quite charming.
My favorite villain is Gaston.
I know, I love how he has such a big ego.
Gaston would probably be an attractive person in real life.
I have to say the real life action movie was well cast for Gaston!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mary poppins was such a good movie
I wish I had a nanny like that.
I know I would also like to be able to clean with magic.
I liked the chimney sweep scene
i liked the part when the art came to life
that was a really neat scene also
the music was good in this movie
it really was a classic musical Disney movie
Mary Poppins should really exist, she is my favorite
she is also my favorite, I wish I had her as a kid!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Aladdin is a musical stage play coming to town soon?
Yes, I saw the ad for it on TV last night.
I want to see it.
I'd miss Robin Williams as the Genie.
Yes, but I'm sure whomever they cast as the Genie will be good.
No doubt, but I'll be comparing him to Robin Williams. He's who I know as the Genie.
I suppose so.
I get nostalgic when it comes to Disney.
Me, too I guess.
But I still want to see the musical!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite movie?
My favorite movie of all time?
Yeah, the movie you can watch over and over again.
Well, let me think about it for a bit, it has to be a Disney one.
Seriously? Mine is also from Disney!
Cool! Well, I think my favorite one has to be The Lion King.
That's such a classic, I love that movie!
Yeah, it has a great plot and compelling characters.
And amazing songs.
Yeah, and amazing song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you end up seeing the new live action Beauty and the Beast movie??
No not yet but I heard that it did really well at the box office.
Me too. I heard because of the success of this one they're going to make a live action The Little Mermaid too!
That's awesome! That was one of my favorites growing up.
Yeah I'll be excited to see what they do with it.
Well I heard that the live action Beauty and the Beast was really well done and that Emma Watson was the perfect Belle.
I saw the photographs of her in the yellow ball gown. Remember the scene where Mrs. Potts is singing "Tale as Old as Time" and they're dressed up and dancing?
Of course I remember that! And I saw the photographs too. I agree Emma Watson was the perfect Belle.
I wonder who they'd cast for The Little Mermaid?
Hmm, I think that Bella Thorne or Karen Gillan could do it. They both have red hair and are young.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of disney's more recent work?
I think disney puts out so many films it varies.
That is a good point.
The caliber of film they put out varies so widely, you have hits like frozen and but also have Teen beach movie 2.
Ya, they almost seem from different worlds or studios altogether.
They  are certainly different in quality.
That is the thing with disney such a huge studio now they produce all kinds of movies.
Well overall I think they produce some of the best films out even today. take frozen or even the new star wars films.
True, the work they have done on star wars is impressive and high caliber.  But don't forget flops they have to like tomorrowland.
I did not think of Tomorrwland as  a flop, but they do have different levels of work quality now more than the past.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the old live action Disney movies?
Yes, I have seen them all.
Which one is your favorite?
The Happiest Millionaire. I love it.
Oh that is a great one!
Personally, I think it is better than Mary Poppins.
Speaking of Mary Poppins, what did you think of Saving Mr. Banks?
It was so good! Tom Hanks portrayed Walt Disney really well.
Oh I agree. The backstory was interesting.
I was shocked about the real story. It was a neat movie though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I just saw Mulan. That movie was epic!
I'm glad you liked it. It was about time Disney set one of their movies in China.
So was the movie based on a true historical story?
Most likely not. A lot of ancient Chinese legends are highly embellished to begin with. And to top it off Disney didn't even follow the source material very closely.
What do you mean? Mulan didn't actually dress up as a guy to fight the Huns?
Well she did, but the original had a lot more going on, and, to be honest, the original did not have a happy ending.
Well, then it makes sense that Disney decided to change the plot. You can't movie a movie about empowering girls only to end it on a tragic note.
Indeed, I'm not going to criticize Disney for exercising creative license here.
So what was your favorite part of the movie?
The Mulan Szechuan Sauce Mc'Donald's put out to celebrate the release. Don't laugh, that sauce changed my life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The song "A Girl Worth Fighting For" is totally ruined by the ending, I think.
Wait, what ending?
Oh, don't you remember from the movie?
No.
They're marching along and singing that song, and then they suddenly stop singing because they see the village that's been destroyed.
Oh now I remember! Yeah, that's so sad.
The little girl's doll! I cried, probably.
Oh yeah I felt so bad for her.
Disney movies make me cry all the time though.
Yeah, Tarzan...The Lion King...ok, they've all made me cry probably.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many remakes of the Disney movies do you think they will make?
Like, into live action ones?
Yes, from the cartoon.
Well, Cinderella did not do to well.
Beauty and the Beast did ..
I know they were doing a Little Mermaid one.
I think the actress they wanted back out.
I heard they are doing a Lion King one too.
That will just be Hamlet then, if it does not have Lions.
Lion King is based on Hamlet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Maleficent was such an amazing story
it really was, the costumes were amazing
I liked how she called the baby Beastly
and how she cursed her but took care of her because the fairies could not
I know she gave her food in the leaf that was sweet
and she always watched over her as she grew up
I liked it when the girl discovered her
I hated when Maleifcent's wings were cut off
that scene was so scary and traumatic for her I bet
I am glad she got them back though, very moving story
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Aladdin?
No i usually don't watch disney movies!
Well if you gonna watch one you should watch this one!
Why is that?
Well for 1. Robin Williams, he is an amazing person who plays one of the best characters of all in Disney movies, The Giene.
What does he do?
Well he helps al out by granting him 3 wishes. but that is the giene's job.
Seems like a pretty lame job to me.
Well he also uses his 3rd wish to let the Genie free
Thats really nice, Maybe i will watch it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your most anticipated movie release?
I think it would have to be Coco by Disney.
Oh, I haven't heard about that movie, what is about?
It's a story of a young Mexican boy on the day of the dead or something like that.
That seems interesting, it's an animated one right?
Yeah, and as always the animation looks amazing and so well produced.
I might give it a chance, what is the premier date?
On August I believe, I'm planning on going with my whole family.
That sounds cool, let me know how well you liked it.
I sure will, I hope you go to watch it too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Disney ballad?
I do. It's When You Wish Upon a Star.
Why do you like it so much?
I think the lyrics are realy inspirational.
My favorite is So This is Love from Cinderella.
That's a pretty song.
It is and I like how romantic it is.
True.
Seems like Disney has a lot of good ballads.
They have some good song writers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know they Snow White was Disney's first feature film?
Oh wow! No, I didn't know that.
Yeah,Walt was really proud of his accomplishment.
I can't say I blame him! I'd be proud if I ever made a movie!
Me too! Though I'd rather be a Disney Princess.
Ha ha! Now that would be something!
Wouldn't it? Could you imagine being a mermaid like Ariel?
I think I'd rather be like Belle from Beauty and the Beast.
Yeah, that Beast was kind of rugged and dreamy.
Sure, but I was dreaming of the dress and having talking objects that cooked and cleaned for me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you name any famous singers that sang for Disney movies? Like Billy Joel sang for Oliver and Company.
Yes, I think Bette Milder sang in that one too. Let me think about it for a minute.
Okay, I will name another while you are thinking. Donny Osmond sang for Mulan..
Peggy Lee sang for Lady and The Tramp.
Really, I did not know that. Mandy Moore sang for Tangled.
Nice, how about Shakira sang for Zootopia.
Let's see, Tevin Campbell sang for A Goofy Movie.
I don't know who that is. I guess it is my turn, Cliff Edwards sang for Pinocchio.
My personal favorite is Phil Harris for The Jungle Book.
That is the cool thing about singing in a Disney movie, it will last forever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Jungle Book?
Yes, it was interesting
That's my favorite Disney movie
It's good that the wild animals treated him so well
It is pretty amazing they liked him at all
The snake is the same as the one from Robin Hood
I wonder how it got to Nottingham
I liked the Bear Nececcities
It's catchy
Living in a jungle would actually be terrible
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any new Disney movies lately?
No, I haven't.
Why haven't you seen any?
Mostly because I'm a fan of the older Disney movies that I was able to watch while I was in their target age group.
So you feel like you've out grown these types of movies?
Pretty much.  Sometimes I still enjoy children's movies from time to time.
Could you name some of the movies that you can remember from your childhood?
Yes.  Bambi, Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio, and Cinderella are a few that come to mind.
Are these movies you would show to your children?
Absolutely.  The content of these films is perfectly fitting for a child.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana that Disney just released recently?
Oh, I have always wanted to see that movie, looks very visually pleasing
indeed, especially the water, they look so cool
I have seen the trailer, the big hawaiian dude with a funny girl, I was really intrigued
yeah, you should go see it, it's really good. Those 2 have a lot of fun lines
Yea, I would definitely go watch that, just for the fact they have cool sand and water simulation
I know right, it's pretty amazing what they made in the studio
All they need is a brilliant idea and a group of artists work together, and voila Moana!
haha, indeed.
alright, I'll mark that on my schedule
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch The Lion King when you were younger?
Of course I did. That was the first time I cried in a movie.
Let me guess. The stampede scene made you cry?
Yeah, that remains to be one of the saddest moments in movie history.
Definitely. I felt so bad for little Simba.
Timon and Pumbaa made it better though.
I totally forgot about Timon and Pumbaa. I used to love them.
Remember when they all ate bugs together?
Yeah that part grossed me out when I was younger.
It was the opposite for me. It made me want to try it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been to see the latest, 2017 version of Beauty and the Beast?
You mean the one with Emma Watson as Beauty and Dan Stevens as the Beast?
Yes that one! I haven't seen it yet have you?
No, but I really want to.
I want to see how Dan Stevens plays the Beast. I enjoyed him so much in Downton Abbey, and this is a very different role for him!
I'll say, and it's also a pretty big switch for Emma.
I heard that Emma sings in this movie.
They probably all do, don't you think?
Maybe, I guess that is likely. I really enjoyed the music of the older version from 1991.
You mean the animated one. Yes, that had an awesome soundtrack. Maybe this one does too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mulan is one of my favorite movies.
I have never seen it.
Really? It's been out since 1998.
What's the premise of the movie?
It's retelling of a traditional Chinese folktale.
That's so interesting.
Yes, Disney is great with historical films.
I agree. I will see Mulan as soon as possible.
That's great. There is also a sequal called Mulan II.
I will see that as well!
XXXXXXXXXXX
One thing I’ve always felt Disney did great was tell stories in their films.  Any movie that really stands out as telling a great story to you?
I’d have to say, Beauty and the Beast. I have always thought that movie was just a great story.
I completely agree. It’s an amazing movie, but also a classic story that speaks for itself.
Definitely. While it is simple, it’s quite compelling at the same time.
A formally man, now cursed to be a monster manages to find love.
Yes, and the thing is, they present Belle as believable in terms of falling for him.
I also like the character development of The Beast, especially. As the film goes on, you get to see his softer side.
I think that is part of what makes the movie so great. You begin to really like him.
Yes. Overall, Beauty and the Beast is an amazing story.
I completely second that. It’s a classic and always will be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite disney movie?
Ive always like aladdin.
Thats a good movie
Yea, its a classic, i still have it on vhs
Wow, do you have a favorite character?
Definitely genie

He os hilarious, he makes the movie
I like how jasmin has a tiger
Yea, its cute
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that they put Lilo and Stitch on Netflix?
No way!
Yes! I just watched it last night for the first time in 15 years.
Is the movie really that old?
Yes, can you believe it?
No I can't. I will have to watch it again soon.
You have to, it brought back so many good memories. I used to love that movie.
I did too. I loved Lilo, I thought she was awesome.
She is awesome! Stitch is pretty funny, too.
He sure is. I will let you know what I thought about it once I am done.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see any movies by Disney recently?
I saw High School Musical.
Oh really?
Yeah.
That movie is so old though. But the music is good I will admit.
Yeah it had been a long time since I watched so I wanted to watch again.
Who is your favorite in it?
I like Zach Efron and Vanessa Hudgens.
I like them too.
I also like Ashley Tisdale.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast?
No, I loved the cartoon
Then you should go see the new one!
yeah but i dont want to ruin the cartoon
I hear ya but I think you would be surprised.
Disney always does a great job at these things.
They really do.
I think I want to keep my view of the movie as it is
It will only enhance it!
Alright maybe I will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm looking forward to Cars 3.
I'm excited for the movie too. This one seems very action packed.
The trailer is so cool. The graphics for it are very impressive.
Every year, Disney's animation team always makes something better and better.
Yeah! And you can't help but think, "What could be better than this?"
Right! Do you think Cars 3 will be the end of Cars?
I think so... Honestly, I thought Cars ended on its second film.
I thought so too. But what about Planes?
I think those are considered as "Spin Off" since it has a different cast?
But they're definately related in the same "universe," you would think?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited to see the new Cars 3 movie?
I'm looking forward to it.
I really hope that it is a good one.
Sometimes these sequels don't live up to the hype.
I hope Lightening McQueen, Mater, and Sally, and the rest of the gang are in it.
Me too, it would be a shame if they weren't.
I missed Sally in the 2nd movie.  Didn't seem right she was only in a few scenes.
I know, I felt the same way.  She was a huge part of the first movie, seemed a shame to not bring her back strong in the 2nd.
You'll have to tell me how you like the new one.
Definitely, and you too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats the last Disney movie you watched?
Snow Dogs
What? I don't think thats a Disney Movie
It is. It's part of their live action movie franchise.
Sounds interesting, whats it about?
It's about a Dentist who inherits a lot of huskies and has to take them across the Tundra
I think I've heard of it. Who stars in it
Cuba Gooding Jr.
Oh he is very funny
I highly recommend it if you like light hearted family movies
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Cars 3 is out this weekend?
Already? I had no idea!
We should go see it.
What time do you want to go?
It doesn't matter, but I'm exicted to see it!
I heard it was sad.
What do you mean it's sad? Does something happen to Lightning McQueen?
I don't know it's just what I heard.
I'm avoiding the internet for this one because I don't want to ruin it.
That's fine I still want to see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what's your favorite Disney movie?
Do I have to pick one specific?
Yeah.
Well, my favorite's probably SLeeping Beauty.
Why Sleeping Beauty?
Lot of colors. The fairies are just funny as hell. Plus Prince Phillip is sexy as hell.
Okay, what your favorite modern Disney movie?
There aren't Many. Modern as in how long ago?
Let's say, last 20 years.
Is Tangled Disney?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney villain scares you the most?
Ursula
She was very scary in The Little Mermaid
I agree. I did not like her
She used to give me nightmares
Same here. That is so funny
Cruella de Vil gave me nightmares
She was very scary
Her hair and her sharp face were frightening.
Yeah and her fur coat
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Snow White is one of the best Disney movies.
Why is that?
Well, it was one of the first ones. So it kind of started something larger.
I guess that's true. Is the movie itself that great though?
I liked it! The dwarves were funny and the witch was really creepy.
Yeah, I remember I used to have nightmares about her trying to offer me an apple as a kid.
I also just loved the animation style back then. It was hand-drawn!
It is kind of neat that they used to do that.
I wish they still made hand-drawn movies.
Maybe Disney will eventually go back to that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's your favorite newer Disney movie?
Well, I really liked the new Jungle.
Oh you are right, it was really good.
Yeah, I thought the special effects were really good looking.
They were good! And the acting was good too.
Yeah, the boy that starred in it did really well.
Yeah, I think he might of been better than the older jungle book movies.
True. I really liked Idris too.
Yeah, his voice was really perfect for that part.
I even jumped a couple times from his loud booming voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Princess Diaries?
Yes, I have. I was Anne Hathaway's first movie wasn't it?
I think so. She was really funny in it.
I loved the makeover scene.
Yeah, before her makeover it was so convincing that she was average looking.
She's definitely not average looking.
They made a sequel to it but I didn't like it.
Yeah, the whole concept of forcing her to marry someone put me off.
She found a good guy in the end though.
Only through luck. I liked the guy she was with in the first movie but they totally got rid of him for Chris Pine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Peter Pan is one of best Disney films.
Oh, I saw the new live action movie the other day.
I think it's one of those Disney movies that translates well to a more adult movie. Like Cinderella.
Yeah, I think it would be hard to adapt Bambi to attract a more adult audience.
Oh don't get me started on Bambi. I don't feel like crying today.
You mean when mom dies?
Yes, when the mom dies. Okay?
Don't think about the mom. You should think about Thumper.
Oh, I adore Thumper.
Eating greens is a special treat, It makes long ears and great big feet. But it sure is awful stuff to eat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
peter pan was kind of messed up
how so?
i mean, i get that peter was eternally a kid or whatever...
but?
BUT, he was actually just an old man dressing as a kid to steal other kids. if you think about it
okay, that is kind of messed up. where do you come up with this stuff?
i'm just saying!
maybe captain hook was trying to get the lost boys back home. that's why they had so much beef
maybe! you never know
either way...that is officially the most messed up disney movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the name of the Warthog from the Lion King again.
Simba?
No, that's the lion. The main character. The warthog.
I'm not sure. I know the meerkat is Timon, if that helps.
It doesn't. This has been driving me nuts all day.
Why don't you just google it?
I would, but my phone is out of battery.
Why don't you just use mine?
Thanks. It looks like it's Pumbaa.
Of course! Pumbaa!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen what new Disney movies are coming out this week?
No, have you?
Yeah, they have Cars 3.
That should be awesome!
Yeah, my kids are thrilled.
I think I am thrilled hearing that.
My kids have been asking me to go to the movies, and this Disney one is a hit.
I know, Disney never fails to amaze me.
They are so creative at Disney.
Only the best artists are working on their movies.  The songs are incredible too in the movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Me and my sister were arguing the other day about what was the best Disney movie ever.
What was your favorite?
I said Bambi was the best Disney movie ever made. Everyone has seen and knows and loves that movie.
It was really touching, and the animals were so cute.
My sister said Cinderella was the best Disney movie ever. She said every little girl saw that movie and cheered for Cinderella and dreamed of meeting a Primce Charming like her.
That's a tough one. I think Cinderella might be a little more better known than Bambi, just because the name is still mentioned when talking about evil stepmothers.
So which Disney movie do you think is the best one ever made?
Actually, I always thought Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs was the best, because it was such an original plot, and I always loved those dwarfs.
I went online to see what other people ranked in top ten lists and stuff like that, hoping to break the tie. But all the lists kept mentioninng the same one as number one- The Lion King.
I think that's just because people think in two categories of Disney movies, the new ones, and the old classic ones. People voting The Lion King were obviously just thinking of the newer movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I also think the Disney movies have an appeal for adults.
I agree. Some of the innuendos are very clever. The kids think they are funny but the adults understand the subtle underlying joke.
One of my favorite Disney movie that did this was Shrek.
I agree! I laughed so hard at some of the double meanings in the jokes.
I also love the voices. When I think of the actors like John Goodman that are the voice of an animated character, I just laugh.
I loved him and Billy Crystal as Sulley and Mike in Monsters, Inc.. They were so funny.
Their acting ability definitely comes through their voice.
I think the animation in the Disney movies has become remarkable. I remember when it was so simplistic like in the original Jungle Book.
I agree that the technical capabilities has come so far in just ten to fifteen years.
I think I enjoy them just as much as kids sometimes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Cars 3.
Oh! Was it good?
It was ok. The first will always be my favorite.
Yeah, I understand. It had to be better than the Planes version, right?
Yes, that one was terrible. The sequels have all kind of been lame.
Well, it's nice to see Owen Wilson in something again.
Yeah, it's been forever! He is definitely the voice of Lightning McQueen.
My kids just got rid of all their Cars toys. I'm sure they will be regretting that.
Yes, it kind of made me want to play with that stuff again!
I will have to take them tonight. It sounds fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Honey, I Blew up the Kids! was a funny movie
I know that baby was so big!
He wanted his mom so bad but he was too big to hold
I think at that point that Dad should have just stopped with all his inventions
seriously, if I was the mom I would have said to get out
I know! He could just invent other things
I would make a lot of things bigger, like my house for starters
so would I , those kids should have stayed away from his stuff though
yes, it was partially their fault
that is true, but at the same time that dad was just a bad inventor I think
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite actor in Toy Story?
I liked Tim Allen a lot.
Really? You didn't like Tom Hanks?
I liked him too. But, Tim Allen was my favorite.
He did have a good voice.
Don Rickles was great as Mr. Potato Head.
It's too bad he will not be in part 4.
Yeah, but part 1 will always be the best and he is in that.
There are some really great voice actors in those films.
Yes, it is a great talent to be able to voice a character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the Disney movie The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad.
I watched it when I was a kid but I really don't remember what it is about.
Wasn't it based on Sleepy Hollow?
I thought it was two different movie segments.
Oh yeah, there was the Wind and the Willow part about Mr Toad?
Do you remember what that one was about?
Wasn't Mr Toad an adventurer that never paid attention to costs.
Yes but I haven't seen it in so long that I do not remember the plot.
Maybe we should watch it again.
Good idea, how about Friday night?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the scariest thing you have ever seen in a Disney movie?
Well, you know about my phobia for Chernabog from "Fantasia."
That I do, other than him, who or what gives you the creeps?
I think it would have to be "Ursula" from "The Little Mermaid."
Really, what about her?
She turned people into little sea slugs!
Creepy little sea slugs!
Exactly and she stole voices and-AND she tried to steal Eric from Ariel.
True, she was a real witch.
A real "sea witch." Sorry, couldn't help it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Robin Williams gave the Genie so much character in Aladdin.
I love Robin, but others could have did just as well.
Really, who??
Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock to name a few
All fine actors, but that role was practically made for Robin.
Give me a better argument.
You can pratically see Robin himself acting rather than a cartoon.
That's actually a good point.
His mannerisms even in cartoon form were top notch.
He was such a lengend; R.I.P.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hard to believe, but it's the five year anniversary of Brave.
Really?  Wow, I'm getting old.
I loved the accents in that movie.  I wish I had a cool voice.
I wish you did too.  Merida's voice was kind of grating though.
She was a bit whiny, but it was still unique.
I didn't really get the ending though.
You mean how the mom got better?
Yeah because it was after the sunrise and somehow it still worked.
Better to not ask questions and just accept it.
I guess, but it would be good to understand it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I recently just watched Moana on Netlix. Have you seen it?
No, actually. I haven't gotten a chance to see it yet.
You definitely should watch it, it's a great movie.
I bet it is! I usually love all Disney movies. I love re-watching older ones.
Which movies do you re-watch?
I really love Mulan and the Jungle Book.
I agree about Mulan. Mooshoo is one of my favorite Disney characters.
I can't wait until the live action version comes out!
Same here!! If it's anything like the new Jungle Book, it's going to be amazing.
We definitely should go see it when it comes out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite movie of all time?
I am a big fan of animated movies.So, I can list a few.
Any particular movie you liked?
Disney has created some high quality movies over recent years but The Lion King still takes the cake.
Oh yes! It brings back the memories of my childhood.
I still remember that I cried when Mufasa died.
It was a heart breaking moment. Any sweet moments you had?
I adored the young Simba. Loved it when he roars for the first time.
It released in 1994. Can't believe it's been 23 years.
Oh my god! It's been 23 years. I feel old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of Disney's classic movies from before they started making computer animated features?
Yes I have. They were some of my fondest childhood memories!
Really? What where some of your favorites?
I really liked the older classics like Snow White and Cinderella. But my favorite of all time would have to be Aladdin.
Why is Aladdin your favorite Disney movie?
Because Robin Williams as the Genie was the most amazing thing ever!
Oh yes, his performance certainly stole the show.
There's that, and I also loved the little monkey in the movie.
Do you mean Apu?
Yes, that's the one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Today I heard that the art Sleeping Beauty was based on old tapestries.
Isn't it considered the gold standard for Disney art?
Yes, now that I'm an adult, I can really appreciate the historical artistic touches.  But I didn't like it as a kid.
I understand.  The tiny hooves on the horse used to bother me, but now I think he's cute.
Can you imagine having to do all that art by hand?  The continuity editors must have had a real headache.
And all the man hours that were involved.
Did you like Aurora's dress better in pink or blue.
I liked both.  But they should have mixed the two and done purple.
That would have been a good compromise.
What they really should have done is asked her what color she wanted her dress to be, and gone with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How far in advance does Disney-Pixar anounce their new movies.
Well, there's a ton of movies that are supposed to be getting made, but only so many are given rough release dates.
Like what, they'll tell us the movies that are coming out this specific year?
More than that. You can actually see online that a bunch of Disney-Pixar movies are coming out in 2019 and 2020.
That's a ways away.
Yes, but think of how good Disney-Pixar films are. They take time!
Are any of the upcoming movies sequels?
Yes, a bunch.
What sequels are coiming out?
Toy Story 4, Frozen 2, Wreck-It Ralph 2, The Incredibles 2, Mary Poppins Returns, and Cars 3, to name a few.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Everyone's saying that 'Let it Go' from Frozen is the best Disney song ever.
That's crazy! There are so many songs that are classics.
That's what I said! What about Aladdin's "A Whole New World"?
And "Tale as Old as Time" from Beauty and the Beast?
And even more old school like "When you Wish Upon a Star" from Cinderella?
So we agree, classic Disney still holds up.
Absolutely. Although I do love "Let it Go."
Yeah, it's a great song. And I like the snowman song too.
"Do you Want to Build a Snowman"? Yeah, that's pretty fantastic as well.
So perhaps not the best ever but they can be added to the list of great ones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Hmm, probably Peter Pan if I had to answer.
Ooh good pick. Who was your favorite character.
Pan duh, who was yours?
Hehe, the crocodile!
What? Why?
Well without the crocodile there is no ending, hook would still be going after Pan.
Exactly! That's why he shouldn't have been involved, it could've been longer.
What was your favorite part?
When Pan flew for the first time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the movie Beauty and the Beast.
I love that movie.
Did you see they came out with a new one?
Yes, I did. I really love the animated one though.
I saw the new one last week.
Wow was it?
Excellent. Josh Groban played the Beast.
He has a great singing voice.
He does, you should go see it.
I will this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think it's so strange that Star Wars movies are considered Disney movies now.
I agree. I think Star Wars should be its own thing.
I know! I just associate Disney movies with kids.
Yeah, Star Wars movies are more for adults. I guess kids like them too though.
Most of the Star Wars movies these days are rated PG-13.
I think they're geared more towards teenagers and adults then with that rating.
Yeah, I never associated Disney movies with movies for teenagers and adults.
Maybe Disney is going in a new direction.
Maybe they are. I guess the Pirates of the Caribbean Movies are geared towards teens and adults.
True, but I'm still not quite sure what to think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like older, classic Disney films. Do you?
Yes, I love the classics. Lady and the Tramp is a favorite of mine.
I loved that, too. Even though it was released in 1955, it's still one of the best in my opinion.
Jock is the cutest. He cracks me up the way he skips and buries his bones.
I like all the characters. I couldn't stand the mean Aunt that came to stay with the baby.
She was horrible, she was so mean to Lady.
I also got upset with the coach hit Trusty in the end. I was worried he wouldn't make it.
That was upsetting. He came through which is a good thing.
I love Peggy Lee was great as Peg the shelter dog. She had such a beautiful voice in the movie.
Did you know she also voiced the characters of Darling and the siamese cats?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the live-action version of Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, I did. Emma Watson was good in it.
I didn't expect much from Emma Watson after the Harry Potter movies ended.
She did a very good job.
Did you like it compared to the animated version from the '90s?
It was too different to compare easily. I liked both in different ways.
Did you have a favourite part?
I loved the scene where the villagers fight all the people who were turned into household objects.
I liked that too, you don't often see funny fight scenes.
It was very well done. Action scenes can be very boring but this one worked.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney animation.
Robin Hood.
That was a classic.
I love Baloo as Little John.
He was pretty hillarious.
Prince John was pretty spot on too.
"Hiss, you've hissed your last....hiss!"
Ha! What a great line.
Hiss was pretty funny too.
There were a lot of Jungle Book dupes in that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Disney Princess?
When I was little I liked Mulan and I know Lilo doesn't count but she should.
I think Lilo's sister Nani is a great character. Watching that movie as an adult and hearing it Nani's situation makes my heart reach out.
Do you have a favorite princess?
I always like the music of Pochahontas but I never really picked a favorite girl.
Was there a princess in Atlantis?
Yeah! I think her name was Kida.
I always liked her hair.
Atlantis was a great movie. I should find the sequel.
Let's watch it together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Frozen from Disney?
yes, I have. It was such a fun movie, winter is coming.
You know, the main theme music, let it go?
yea, it stuck in my head for quite a while after watching the movie
such a good movie, I think it has good motivation for young girls, after all, it's trying to teach young girls' to be smarter and more realistic
Disney definitely did a good job on that
do you think it's possible they make a sequen on that?
I'm not sure, I think the ending was good enough, people always ask for more for movies they love
that's true
but I won't mind if there's a sequel
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
That's a tough one. I love them all!
Yeah, but if you HAD to pick just ONE Disney movie that is your absolute favorite, what would it be?
Hmm....... I guess I would have to say Alice in Wonderland.
That's such a great movie! What do you like about it specifically?
I just like the whole story line. It's so interesting and most of it makes no sense and that's what I love about it!
Any favorite characters?
I love The Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. What's your favorite Disney movie if YOU had to pick?
Don't make me choose. I love them all too! I guess I would have to say The Sword in the Stone.
That's another one of my favorites too! Great choice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did Beauty and the Beast come out?
The cartoon version right?
Yes
That was 1991 I think
Wow, I was a kid then.
When did Pinocchio come out?
That was in the 40's I think.
Wow, I never knew there was such a big time difference there.
Yeah, they started making animated films since the 30's. Snow White was first in 1937.
Wow. That was a long time ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Disney movies because I grew up watching them!
I know, I love Toy Story!
Yeah, I like how you can find characters from other Disney movies in some of their movies.
Like how Tarzan and Frozen are supposedly connected?
Yeah, I also am so glad that they redid Beauty in the Beast with live characters!
I don't know, I have always enjoyed the original as it was.
That is true, some movies should stay animated, but not 101 Dalmatians!
Oh no, that is definitely a classic!
What is the Disney movie with the fish named Flounder?
The Little Mermaid!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw The Parent Trap last night.
The original or the reboot?
The 1961 original.
I loved Hayley Mills in that.
Maureen O'Hara was lovely as well.
Vicky Robinson was great as the fiancee.
She played a role in the fiancee's mom in the reboot.
Cool. Who was the minister?
The great Leo G. Carroll.
He was great in North by Northwest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, wasn't it great?
I thought it was fantastic. Emma Watson did a wonderful job.
There were so many guest stars! I tried to guess them all.
So did I! I missed Ewan McGregor, though.
Oh, he was the candelabra, Lumiere.
My favorite was Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts.
She was great. How many times did you see it?
I watched it three times in theater.
I'm buying it the day it comes out on DVD!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did you think about Frozen?
I was really surprised that Anna was more a main character than Elsa.
Yeah that was odd but Oloaf was my favorite.
Definatly. He was so funny. Some things he said when he was dreaming about summer.
Or when kristoff said "I'm going to tell him"
Yeah that was funny too.
I still don't understand how all of a sudden she could contol her power at the end.
Yeah that was odd. And every one in the kingdom had turned on her and then poof everything is back to normal.
Yeah oh well I still think it was a good movie.
Meh. There was too much singing and all the songs get stuck in my head.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Disney movies!  Have you ever seen Snow White?
I sure have, it's and oldie but a goodie for sure, I think it came out in the 30's.
Yes, it did, 1937 to be exact.
The mirror and the Evil Queen scared the heck out of me when I was little.
Yes, me too, the voice of the Queen is so creepy and when she turns into the old hag, it's even creepier.
I kept yelling "don't eat the poison apple Snow White"!
The home of the seven dwarfs is so cute, tucked away in the woods.
Speaking of woods, wasn't that part scary when she was lost in the woods and the trees were like monsters?
Yes, the movie has some really scary stuff in it!
It's a great movie that will withstand the test of time for sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My granddaughters favorite Disney Movie is Sleeping Beauty.
Really? Thant was a good movie.
She love Princess Aurora and Prince Philip.
I loved those little fairy ladies, what were their names?
Flora Fauna and Merriweather.
They were so cute.
Yes they were.
It was pretty scary when Princess Aurora touched the spindle of the spinning wheel.
That was scary.
That was a good movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you watched the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
No, I haven't but I have been wanting to. How was it?
It was great! I actually watched the new one before the old cartoon one.
Really? I watched the old cartoon one a long time ago, but I'd like to watch this one too.
You really should, it was so good! Emma Watson played the perfect Belle.
I imagine she would have played a good Belle, she is beautiful!
Yes she definitely is, but what was most impressive was her acting skills.
She is a great actress!  Was the storyline the same as the cartoon movie?
Yes, exactly like it, right down to the musicals.
They usually change movies so much when remaking them. That's so surprising that they didn't do it with this one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Pocahontas on a plane ride yesterday.
What'd you think?
Awful movie.
You're awful!  What did you hate it.
Mel Gibson did a horrible job as John Smith.
He wasn't in it that much really.
Yeah, but every scene, all I can think about was how I don't like Mel Gibson
So really, it's not about not liking the movie, it's about you not liking Mel Gibson.
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
You should give the movie another try, just mute his parts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that great football movie, Remember the Titans?
No I missed it.
It is very special?
I thought is a was a typical football movie.
No this one tells a unique and powerful story.
Ok that sounds interesting.
Yes Denzel Washington gives a great performance also.
I like him, he is a great actor.
Yes he shines in this, its a story that needs to be told, for this film.
Ok thanks for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the live action Beauty and the Beast?
I did and I loved it!
I loved that the story line was just like the animated feature.
Yes and it was amazing that they could pull off all those animated scenes that seemed like they would have been impossible.
They did an amazing job with the Gaston song where they are in the pub.
Yes, and Gosh Gad's character was fantastic.
Yes, it was funny when he turned on Gaston in the end.
Yes, that was one thing I didn't remember from the original.
I didn't either but it was great.
The beast sure turned handsome when he turned human again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We just saw the new Cars 3 movie!
Really? How was it?
We loved it. It was better than the second Cars movie.
Why do you say that? I liked the second movie.
This one focused more on Lightning McQueen like the first movie. The second one was more focused on Mater. I really like Owen Wilson who is the voice of Lightning.
That's good. Since Mater is my favorite character, that is why I liked the second movie so much. I think Larry the Cable Guy is hilarious.
I like that they continue to introduce new characters like Cruz Ramirez to the existing cast of characters to make the movie so interesting.
I agree, the writers for the Cars series are so talented. I need to go see this one today!
You should! Let me know what you think of it. I hope it is successful enough for them to make a 4th movie!
I'll let you know. Thanks for letting me know how good it is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see Cars 3 this summer?
No, I don't think so. Are you going to see it?
I might. I think the graphics look awesome.
Yeah, I agree the graphics do look cool. I just think they need to be done with the Cars movies.
I'm willing to give Cars 3 a chance. Toy Story 3 ended up being one of the best movies, so maybe this will be okay.
Yeah, but Toy Story 2 was also good. Cars 2 wasn't that great.
I'm thinking maybe Pixar and Disney learned from their mistakes in the second Cars movie.
I hope so, otherwise Cars 3 will be even worse than Cars 2.
I bet Disney doesn't care though. The franchise is probably meant for kids who don't care much about the plot anyways.
You're probably right about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite Disney movie?
Mulan. What about yours?
The Lion King. I watched it more than 10 times when I were young.
Yeah I like it too. What do you like the most about Disney movies?
Well, I grew up with Disney so I didn't analyze much movies when I was younger. But now I liked the stories, the songs during the movie and the funny moments.
Yeah I agree. And the villains, the way they're created. I like it
True. But I don't like the fact that they're kinda the same. You can recognize a movie from Disney just a couple of minutes after watching it.
I disagree. I think they're all unique on their way.
Still have some things in common. Like funny lines and the main characters.
Let's agree to disagree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Have you ever seen 'Finding Dory'?
No, I still haven't watched it. Did you like it?
Yes, It's one of my favorite movies- lets watch it sometime together.
Yeah, that would be great!
Ellen Degeneres voices the character Dory, and Ty Burrell voices a beluga whale named Bailey.
Oh, cool. I love Ellen! Did you like this movie as much as Finding Nemo?
I actually liked it a little better than Finding Nemo if you can believe it!
Awesome, now I'm really excited to see it.
Yes, I just loved the story and message about family. Great for adults and children.
Nice, let's plan to watch it this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really enjoyed Moana.
Oh? How come?
I found the music composition very enjoyable.
Hmm... I will have to disagree. I felt like it tried to compete with Frozen with something super catchy.
What song made you feel that way?
"We know the way."
Are there some songs that you genuinely like though?
I liked "Your Welcome," actually.
Haha, me too. It's silly but cute.
Easy to sing with too even if you can't sing well, haha!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lilo and Stitch is such an underrated movie.
Absolutely.  I love that little alien.
It was great to see an original movie, especially one located in Hawaii.
The music was great in that one.  Kind of paved the path for Moana.
The little girl was a bit of a brat though.
So was the older sister though.
Stitch was the true hero of this movie.  Reminds me of a rabid dog.
I guess that's one way to describe him.
I'm just glad they didn't blow up the Earth.
That would be a very un-Disney like ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love when disney movies bring folklore and mythology into play.
Like when?
Like there was Hades and the titans from Hercules.
And Maui from Moana.
I think Te-Ka too.
I don't know about that.
Maybe she was a symbol for Pele the volcano goddess.
Maybe...
I'd love to here her backstory.
Definitely deserves another movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and Beast movie?
Yes, It was great! What did you think?
I loved it. Maybe even more than my kids!
Was that really Emma Watson singing?
Yes! I never knew she could sing.
I think she was great as the role of Belle but I counldn't help but think about Harry Potter!
I agree. I think they did a really great job recreating it.
It was actually better than I expected.
I am glad I bought a copy of my own. We have watched it several times already.
I will probably go get a copy for my collection too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
If I had to answer I would say none of them.
What?!?!?! How can you like NO Disney movies?
They all have the same ending and its boringly predictable.
That's what people love about them, they have happy endings!
It is precisely what I don't like about them.
Well what would you do then?
I would have the Beast kill Belle and then you can have a sequel.
That's....horrible.
No, that's marketing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the older Disney movies or the newer versions?
I like the older ones better, more nostalgia there.
Yea, I agree, but I like the modern day CGI in the remakes.
I did really like like the remake of the Jungle Book.
Oh, that was amazing! have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?
No, who is in it?
It stars Emma Watson.
Oh man, she is absolutely gorgeous and a very talented actress to boot!
I know, she came a long way from The harry potter films.
I might have to watch the movie now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the best musical Disney movie?
I think Aladdin is.
Really?
Yes. it has the most memorable song.
Which one?
A Whole New World.
That is a classic.
I think it is the best Disney song ever.
I don't know. Under the Sea is pretty good too.
True. But, A Whole New World is still the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i watched fox and the hound again today.
i like that movie.
Todd the fox is my favorite.
I kind of like the dog.
Whats his name?
I think Copper.
its a great story about friendship.
i tear up everytime.
i like the ending.
it was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Beauty and the beast is now out on Blueray and DVD?
Yes, I can't wait to see it again!
Did you see it in the theater?
I did and it was amazing!
My family just watched it the other night. It was my first time seeing it.
What did you think?
I thought it was very good.
What did you think about the actress who played Belle?
I thought she was wonderful. It was nice to see a more down-to-earth Disney princess for a change.
I felt exactly the same. Belle was my favorite character in the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched Pinocchio?
You know I have not even heard about it.
It is a great story I highly recommend it!
I will have to look into watching it.
You should watch it soon, it has so many metaphors to life!
That sounds really interesting we should watch it today!
My favorite part is when Pinocchio finds himself in the really big... Oh never mind I do not want to spoil it for you!
Yeah seriously you know I hate movie spoilers!
I just can't believe you have never seen Pinocchio before that is crazy!
Well lets watch it now then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Do you have a favorite disney movie?
I really like the Little Mermaid.
Yeah great choice.
What about you?
I love the lion king.
Of course, great.
They remind me so much of growing up.
Yeah I know what you mean.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Mulan?
Yes, I watched Mulan years ago.
I wanted to be just like Mulan when I grew up. I wanted to be tough and pretty like she was.
Yes, but it was Eddie Murphy doing the part of Mushu that really made the show.
He was so funny and when he broke the head of the Great Dragon, I laughed till I cried.
Yes, his job was to try to help bring honor to the family but he did not always help her.
No, remember the scene where he was "helping" Mulan think up a name for herself.
Yes, and Chi-Fu makes the comment about no wonder General Li never spoke of a son.
I did like the part where she finally figured out how to climb to the top of the pole.
That was the part that showed that intelligence could play more of a role than just physical toughness.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ratatouille is not a good film.
Wow, you are so wrong.
And how am I wrong?  It's about a dumb rat.
It's about realizing your dreams and that nothing should stop you.
So a rat can somehow cook?
Right.  It means no labels.
Dude, it's a rat controlling a guy by pulling his hair.
You are so missing the point.
I'm not missing any point.  And I hate French food.
You're aching for a fight, aren't you?
XXXXXXXXXXX
so what did you think about the live action remake of the beauty and the beast?
I think it was great...simply phenomenal. How about you?
oh i am a huge fan of Emma Watson, i had to go see it in the first week of its release, movie was awesome
yeah and i loved the special effects and the songs.
oh and the acting and direction too, they did a good job!
i feel that they should start bringing to life more of the old disney classic animated movies.
yeah that seems like the trend. I think it all started with the live action movie of cinderella, then came the jungle book.
ya and they were great too. i am really looking forward to them coming out with a live action alladin movie.
oh yeah that would be cool, with the genie and all. oh how i love all disney movies!
yeah me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
It is strange to me how disney can make some great films and then such awful ones.
What awful ones?
Are you kidding me ? There is a long list of awful disney films.
Such as  what? I want names.
Well to name a few Mc farland,USA. , Teen beach movie, Bad hair day. The list can go on and on.
Well I will say not all there movies are top quality.
Exactly I just find it weird that they can vary so much in the quality of film they make.
Isn't that true of any studio, they have some hits some misses?
Perhaps, I just find it baffling to go from oscar worthy films to teen beach movie 2.
Well I suppose they are trying to make as much money as possible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch The Santa Clause?
Yes I love Tim Allen movies.
I loved how close they made him look to Santa.
Yeah it was funny and odd to see him that big.
The effects they must have had to use.
I dont think it was effects, just alot of makeup.
Did you catch the sequel?
No I liked the original too much
I believe they even did a third one.
I think that is going a bit too far.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it just me or is Ariel mean?
What are you talking about?
Well, maybe not mean, naive would be better.
She's like 15 years old though.
Yeah, but she's immature and goofy.
Again, she's 15 years old.
I guess I just think she should act more her age.
She lives underwater and her father's a king.  Why are expecting realism?
I never said anything about realism, I just don't like her as much as I should.
You really need to get out more and stop focusing on mermaids.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know in some of the older Disney movies, they reused a lot of the film?
Like what?
They reused the dance sequence from Sleeping Beauty in the Belle movie.
Beauty and The Beast?
Yep, they just covered it, but used the same film.
How did they do that?
Pre-Pixar, before they merged most of the Disney animation was done by hand.
Even stuff like the Lion King?
Yep. There were computers involved by then, but most was by hand.
Wow, that makes the movies even cooler.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Snow White, are you a fan?
yes, that was the first great Disney movie
Pretty old now, no?
Yes, but it still contains all the true Disney elements.
Like what?
Princess in trouble, evil, good overcomes evil, happily ever after, etc.
I just remember the dwarves
Yes, the seven dwarves. Each one had a different personality
Provided a lot of comic relief for the movie.
Yes, and they still sell merchandise today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you just love The Lone Ranger?
Yeah absolutely. Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, totally awesome together.
No kidding.
The only thing was it was such a long movie.
Some of Depp's antics fell flat too.
I think he was miscast.
I think he said something publicly to this effect.
But I think Armie was spot on in his role.
The final train scene went on way too long for my taste.
They must have been trying to top all previous western train scenes!
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey do you know if any disney movies are in theaters?
Im not sure but there should be
Why should there be one?
Because disney uusally always has at least one movie in theater and they own other big companies
Really? Like who?
Im pretty sure compaines like marvel are even under disney
no way that is crazy awesome!
Yeah it is because disney has great movies and so does marvel
Yeah i really like marvel movies especially how good they have been
Yeah disney is a good studio producer and knows what they are doing
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you in to Disney at all?
Yeah, growing up I had so many Disney movies!
Same.
Isn't it crazy how they're re-making them all now?
Yeah, they're now targeting all audiences with all the special effects and what not.
Beauty and the Beast, The Jungle Book...
I almost see more adults going into the theaters than kids!
I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that these movies are near and dear to our hearts.
Yeah, like from watching them growing up?
Exactly, just like movies like Frozen will be near and dear to our kids' hearts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss old stuff
like?
Like the black and white Disney movies
Those are so out of date
But they are cool
I mean i guess
No they really are
I did not watch them much
Steamboat willie is the best
I think that one i had though
XXXXXXXXXXX
High School Musical really launches some careers
Most notably I guess you could say Zac Efron
Vanessa Hudgens was in that too.
And you have to add in Ashley Tisdale.
It was almost filmed with an ensemble cast.
The plot to it wasnt that bad either.
It was a standard Disney movie thats for sure.
It was but it connected with audiences
And made them alot of money
Its the starting point for a lot of the kids in it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the cast for beauty and the beast movie?
I love Emma Watson, so it's a yes for me.
I know, she was a great choice.
Also, Ariana Grande sang really well the main soundtrack!
Totally agree, the duet was even more special with John Legend
I have to admit that i had my doubts with that duet but it turned out just great.
The technology to create the beast in the movie was amazing also.
Disney live movies are beginning to seem more interesting every time.
Well, today is the second time i'm going to watch the movie, want to come with us?
Sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
I did! What did you think about it?
I liked it! I thought the way they brought Will and Elizabeth back together was great!
Same! It's hard to believe the series has progressed to their children being old enough to have their own adventures.
Seriously, where has the time gone?
Also, what did you think about Barbosa having a daughter?
Wow! That totally surprised me.
Right? I couldn't believe it either.
Too bad there won't be another one in the series, but at least this last one was great.
I know. Well, onto bigger and better things I guess!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Happiest Millonaire?
I actually kind of like it.
I don't. I think it is one of the lesser Disney movies.
I like it better than Summer Magic.
Well, that one was a total waste of talent.
At least the Happiest Millionaire had Fred McMurrary and Greer Garson.
I do like Lesley Ann Warren in that.
Eh. I'm not too crazy about her.  I like Haley Mills better.
But, the songs are kind of cute in Happiest Millionaire.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So have you told your girls about the new Frozen movie?
Yes I told them at dinner last night.
What did they think about it?
They were excited. They can hardly wait to see it.
I told Marsha about it but she didn't seem tto thrilled.
Oh really, why?
She says she's getting too old for movies like that.
She's only eleven years old, how can she be too old.
I don't know, you know kids growup so fast these days.
Well my girls can't wait to see Ana and Elsa
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch the movie Mulan?
I don't think so. Who's in it?
Well, I'm not sure. It's a Disney movie.
Well, then no I didn't.
It's about a daughter who dresses up as a son to go fight in war so her father doesn't have to.
So she's not a princess in the movie?
No, she's a warrior.
Well, women can do anything.
That was the point. Showing how strong a woman can be, I think.
I never actually heard of that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was inside out a disney movie?
Yes but also pixar, you know they sometimes do them together.
Ah that makes sense. Felt a little different than regular disney animated films.
I too notice the pixar flair in the collaborations they do.
Maybe it is the actual annimation technique or drawings.
Well whatever it is I enjoy it.
Ya they seem to have a winning history. They did Up and Wall-e too.
They have done so many good ones.  Brave was also a joint effort I believe.
Brave was so good. Loved seeing a redhead for a change.
Ya, I liked that aspect too. Also just how strong minded she was as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pinocchio was kind of a scary movie
it was at some parts, like when he was swallowed by the whale
and when he went to that place with those bad boys
Geppeto was always telling him to be careful
I guess he was just a curious boy
that is true, without guidance how would he know how to act
his nose grew so big at one point
I know that part was so weird
how did a puppet know what a real boy was anyway
I know, if he was never alive how would he know !?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Descendants?
Wasn't that the movie released directly on Disney channel?
That's the one.
Nope.  Thought it looked cheap.
I think you'll be surprised, it was quite good.
I prefer to stick with the classics.
Oh really?  What classics do you mean?
Like Tangled, stuff like that.
Dude, you don't even know what the classics were.  Go back to the 90's for much better stuff.
Snow White, hello?  I know the older classics too, buddy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
Lion King, easy.
Who is your favorite character?
I love Nala the best. She took care of her home and talked sense into Simba when he wanted to run from his problems.
Who is your least favorite character?
Probably Zazu, he's so uptight.
And your favorite scene from the Lion King?
I love the entire Hakuna Matata montage.
Oh that's a really good part.
Yes! The animation, the music, it was just cute and my favorite part of the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the Little Mermaid came out the same year we were born?
1989? Really?
Yeah, I was shocked to find that out. I swear I could have remembered it coming out when I was like five.
That's definitely around when I watched it for the first time. Thinking back, I don't remember seeing it in theaters though.
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's weird to think it came out in 1989 though.
I know what you mean. I have this weird bias where I think that movies have improved so much within my lifetime, but it's kind of unfounded.
Right, I have that bias too, but I really think it's the technology that changed not the quality of movies so much.
I disagree, I think that there are way many more great Disney movies coming out today.
I guess you might be right. I really loved Ratatouille, Inside Out, and Moana.
Moana was fantastic. It really inspired my younger sister.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you go to see the remake of Disney's Beauty and the Beast in the theatre?
Yes I did and I loved it, did you go and see it?
I did too! It was amazing. The girl who played Belle was so good in the role. Do you know her name?
It was Emma Watson. I was shocked at how good her singing voice was.
Same! What was your favorite part of the movie?
I think my favorite part was the remake of the formal dance in the library. It was so romantic.
I loved that part too but my favorite part was when Belle ran through the village singing in the opening scene.
The movie really was great. I love how Disney remakes old movies like that.
Me too, it truly keeps the films classic and timeless for future generations.
I agree. I cannot wait until the next remake!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Cinderella?
The Disney one?
Yes! It is my favorite.
I watched it as a kid, but not recently. I remember loving it!
I just watched it with my niece and I forgot how much I loved the little mouse, Gus Gus.
Oh yeah! He was very cute! When I was a kid I named my dog Gus Gus.
That is so funny! I had a cat named after Malifecent from Sleeping Beauty.
Awe! Was he a mean cat?
He could be a bit grumpy at times!
Well at least the name fits!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love all the disney channel cinderella stories
Me too, i really liked the one with selena gomez
Me too, that one was a great cinderella twist.
It was instead of a pronce, it was a movie star
That one was very modern
I liked the one with hilary duff too
Yes so did i
That one was modern as well
It was
They are all good
XXXXXXXXXXX
Every single time I see a deer, I think of Bambi.
Oh I know what you mean!
Disney movies like Bambi probably inspired much of my love for the outdoors.
I know. It's so easy to get attached to the characters.
And there's usually a good lesson for kids in the movies as well.
Yeah, Bambi makes it out in the world even without its mom.
It is really sad when the mother deer dies.
Death is just part of life, I guess.
That's a good point. Kind of heavy for kids though.
But it's a cute movie all the same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes, I hear it was breaking all sorts of records when it came out.
Yeah, I heard that too.
What did you think?
I liked it. It followed the cartoon really closely, but there were some new scenes and some things were explained better.
What do you mean?
In the original animation, they said that the rose would bloom until his 21st birthday, and later they said that they'd been cursed for ten years.
So... the prince was 11 when he got cursed?
Yes. if some lady comes to my house and asks my 11 year old to let her in, I would want him to say no.
Good point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see any of the old Disney films in theaters?
I only remember seeing The Lion King and Aladdin
Those were both 90's right?
Yes
I liked them too. But, I did not see them in theaters
It would be cool to see the older ones in theaters
Like 101 Dalmatians?
Yes
I love that movie
Me too. I bet on the big screen it is even better
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I like Cinderella
Cinderella is the best
I liked the part when the glass slipper fits her
Yeah, it was funny that the sisters couldn't fit it on their foot
Cinderella should have gotten out of that situation
I would not have put up with it
It was a nice house, but not worth it since she was treated worse than a servant
The stepmom was the worst
She was lazy
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the live version of Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, I did.
What did you think about it?
I actually liked it a lot. I didn't think I was going to.
Why is that?
Because I am such a huge fan of the animated version.
Oh, yeah, me, too.
At first, I kept comparing the two in my head, but after a while, I really got into it.
Well, thanks for your thoughts about it. I'm going to check it out as well.
I think you'll enjoy it if you just take it on it's own, don't compare.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard Wreck-it Ralph 2 is coming out in 2018.
Oh, cool. I loved the first one.
I did too. Remember Fix-It Felix?
Oh, yes. His voice was done by that guy from 30 Rock.
Right. The actor's name is Jack McBrayer.
There were so many funny characters in that movie.
I liked how all the bad guys had meetings to talk about how hard it was to be a bad guy.
I remember that. Didn't they have bad guys from actual video games in there?
I think so. I remember Bowser was there.
I wonder what the next movie will be about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the next Disney movie to come out?
Oh, I have no idea.
I feel like they're always making a sequal or a redo.
Agreed, well they did just release Moana.
Yeah, they also remade Beauty and the Beast.
Have you seen either?
Nope, I wanted to see Moana though.
Yeah, me too. I haven't seen either.
I would rather see a new movie than a remake, you know?
Yeah, that makes sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get a chance to see Moana?
Not really, for some reason i wasn't interested in it, is it a musical?
Not really a musical, although it has a bit of singing in it.
Yeah, i know it has Dwayne Johnson, but i look for more action animations.
Well Moana is entertaining to say the least.
Well i might then stream it one day if i'm bored.
I think you should do it, it was a very popular movie.
I can see that.
Let me know when you're gonna watch, i might pop by.
Sure thing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
My favorite Disney movie is Aladdin.
Who is your favorite character on Aladdin?
Aladdin is my favorite Disney movie because the genie is my favorite character!
My favorite Disney movie is Beauty and the Beast.
Who is your favorite character on the Beauty and the Beast?
Belle is my favorite chracter on Beauty and the Beast although Lumiere also came very close!!
Did you watch the new Beauty and the Beast movie that recently was released?
I prefer the original Disney movies because those are all of the movies that I remember from my childhood.
We should have a Disney movie night and watch our favorites together!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's a good Disney movie to watch with my great nephew?
How about Cars?
That's a possibility. I think we have that one.
I like Lightning McQueen.
Me too. I don't remember it much either.
Yeah, it's been a while since I saw it.
Me too. My sons are in their twenties.
He will love Tow Mater too.
I know I liked him.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney animation?
I really like the Great Mouse Detective.
I've never seen that one?
You must!
What is it about?
It's a take off of the Sherlock Holmes stories.
Sounds interesting. What's so great about it?
The villian is voiced by Vincent Price.
That is pretty cool.
He plays Ratigan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Disney movies?
I sure am.
Which are your favorites, the older ones, or the newer ones
I think I like them both equally.  However, of the older ones, I think I life the little Mermaid best.
Me too!  The songs are the best in that one, remember "under the sea"?
Don't you think they should have had Robin Williams in that role?
I think that would have been a poor use of his skills. Although he was in the Aladdin one, right?
I know, but he would have been a great Sebastian
Agreed.  Now that I think about it, there was a great role for Robin Williams in EVERY Disney movie!
I think you are right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really had no idea Mary Poppins was a disney movie
Neither did I
Greatest movie ever
Yes definitely
That movie is a classic
I love all the songs in it
And her mary poppins purse
That can fit the whole town in it?
Exactly
Great movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think 'A Whole New World' was the best Disney song ever.
You're crazy.
Not at all.  What's better?
Hello, Elton John?  Lion King?
Which one are you talking about?
Can You Feel the Love Tonight?  Strike a bell?
Yeah, I heard it at every dance that year.
Best Disney song ever, not even close.
It wasn't even the best song in that movie!
I'm not sure if we can be friends anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
The Little Mermaid!
A classic!
You gotta go with the classics!
Yea I agree@
I love the old art style before modern CGI
I agree.  Modern CGI needs improvement
Yea it looks so blocky in many movies
Yea and it's not just DIsney movies
Same page bro
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy the really old Disney movies?
I love 'Bambi' especially.
That's a beautiful movie the way they illustrated the forests.
Yes, I love how the scenery looks with the old animation.
I do find that movie extremely sad though.
I think everyone does when his mother dies.
I guess that was important for kids to see and learn about.
Yes, there are some interesting life lessons throughout Disney movies.
I just wish I didn't have to feel like crying every time I watch it.
That's exactly the way I feel, but I push though and savor the rest of the film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Pete's Dragon?
No, but I used to love the original one.
There was an older version?
Yeah, it was from the 70s, I think.
Who was in it?
I don't remember.  Actually, I had looked it up a while back and the kid that acted in it doesn't even act anymore.
Was it good?
We loved it.  We had it on VHS.
I loved the new one.  I might have to check out the original.
You would probably like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of disney princesses?
I love  them all, why?
Well there seems to be a lot of talk on their image on young girls.
Oh like the barbie thing?
Yes, Somewhat are they giving young girls unrealistic idols?
They are cartoons, they are not real to begin with.
Well they are animated people and represent an a image to them.
True , I don't think there is anythign so wrong with their image though.
Well you see disney has kind of changed the mold. Look at moana for example.
Yes she is quite different in terms of body. Is she a princess?I have not seen that one yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Favorite Disney princess. Go.
Oh, Moana, easily.
Really? I thought we agreed Belle was the best.
You said favorite. Moana is my new favorite.
Okay, why?
Because she gets things done, because the ocean chose her, and because she didn't need a romantic interest.
Oh yeah, forgot you were aromantic.
Yep, instant identification. Plus her singing voice.
Oh absolutely, How Far I'll Go is STILL stuck in my head.
Can you believe they just FOUND that girl?!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Cars?
Yes, that movie was so cute!
I liked it too. Did you see Cars 2?
No, was that as good?
I don't think sequels are ever as good.
What did you like most about the first movie?
I loved the characters and how they fit their "car" personas so well.
Who was your favorite character?
Tow Mater, for sure! Who do you like?
Have to say the star of the show: Lighting McQueen!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Beauty and the Beast starring Emma Watson yet?
I haven't yet but I am planning to see it this weekend. Have you?
Yes, I did saw it actually last weekend.
How was it?
You know, I went into movie skeptical but in the end I have to say I did like it.
Why did you thought you wouldn't like it?
Well, I thought it would be cheesy like almost all romantic movies are but it wasn't.
How's the acting like?
Emma Watson nailed her character as Belle and so does Dan Stevens as Beast.
Sounds great, I guess I should book tickets now and make sure to see this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Lion King is one of my favorite Disney movies. How about you?
Hmm. Alladin has always been my favorite. The Genie always makes me laugh.
I have heard they are making a new Alladin movie.
Oh yeah!? Another animated film?
No. It is live action, like the Beauty and the Beast movie with Emma Watson.
I loved that movie! Who's going to be in it?
I believe they are still casting but lots of rumors are comming in.
The genie will be some hard shoes to fill!
Robin Williams was always wonderful.
He was great in Flubber also!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on disney films?
I am big animated disney fan.
What you don't like the other films they put out?
I find some of them too mushy. Like McFarland, USA I hated.
Really? It is based on a true story.
I just feel that at times those type of disney film are to sentimental in a way.
Well in their defense it was only co-produced by Disney Pictures. Done with  Mayhem Pictures.
Mayhem Pictures may be slightly to blame then.
I don't think every film is going to appeal to every person. So you hated it someone else loved it.
I am sure they did, many even. I just find disney films  I do enjoy most are the animated features.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
It's either Beauty and the Beast or Mulan.
Well, you have to pick one!
Hmm, it's so hard to decide!
Wait, are you talking about the original Beauty and the Beast or the new live-action version?
The original, of course!
Hey, the new movie was good!
It was okay. Emma Watson is pretty great.
Yeah, what a good actress! Maybe you should wait to decide until you see the new live-action Mulan!
That makes sense. Better ask me again in a couple of years!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How well do you remember the Mulan movie?
Oh, it was one of my favorite Disney movies!
Huh, why is that?
Well, duh, Mulan, the female lead character is represented as a very strong person.
Okay, let me test your knowledge then. Which actor played Mulan?
I've got this. The actor for Mulan's speaking voice is Ming-Na Wen and Lea Salonga did Mulan's singing voice.
Hmmm. I can't verify that without using Google, but you seem confident. I believe you.
What do you think of the movie?
It wasn't my favorite Disney movie, but I definitely got a kick out of Eddie Murphy as Mushu.
You can't beat Eddie Murphy for comic relief.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movie do you like?
which one don't I like?
I don't know. bugs life?
bugs life was cute
it was a nice tale
the characters were super likable.
that is true. it was better than ants
it definitely was
that wasn't Disney though
it wasnt
XXXXXXXXXXX
It is so odd
What is odd
Well it is odd that now Star wars is a disney property
That is not odd
Well i mean its different
Just imagine
Imagine what
Winnie the pooh star wars
Oh no stop that
Why though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi there.
Do you enjoy disney movies?
Yeah sure do.
That's good.  My kids love them.
Oh you watch them with your kids?
Yeah all the time.  It's a great way to spend family time.
That's true.
They really get into them.
That sounds nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you every think about how young Snow White was?
What do you mean?
She's supposedly only 14 years old in the movie!
What? No way!
Yes! Which is even more devastating when you think about how the Queen treated her.
She was just a kid!
Atleast with all that work she had to do, she held her own well in the dwarf cottage.
Yes, they really appreciated her cleaning and cooking for them.
And she was married at 14 also!
To be fair you'd married a prince at 14 if it meant being far away from an evil witch mother.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the new Disney movies better, like Brave, or the older ones, like The Little Mermaid?
I like the older ones--the hand drawn ones. Sleeping Beauty is my favorite, but I really love all the old cartoon styles.
I loved that one! The drawings were so romantic and unique.
Another one like that is Alice in Wonderland. The way it looks is really different from anything else they ever did.
A lot of the older ones are like that. Fantasia has like six different drawing styles in it along, and you can tell the difference between each one.
So do you think the CGI looks more uniform? Like it's all the same from movie to movie?
Well, the CGI sure gets better in quality, right? You look at something like Chicken Little, it doesn't compare to how gorgeous Brave is.
Merida's hair looks like you could reach out and touch it. And yet they still make it look like a cartoon, you know--not just like it's trying to mimic live action?
I hear you. I guess while I like the hand drawn ones best, the CGI is its own art form.
I can't argue with that. Every movie they do expresses something special and takes a ton of time and effort to make it a special thing of its own.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know the opening song in The Lion King?
Yeah I know it, the one that everybody makes up the words to cause they don't speak the actual language.
That is the one. Did you know that it translates to "There comes a lion. Oh yes it's a lion" and its just repeated a bunch of times.
I didn't know that, but that's pretty funny!
Yeah I read about it the other day online.
Here's something I bet you don't know...
What is it?
The Lion King was the first Disney movie that was completely original. Think about it! Every other Disney movie before that is from a story.
Wow I never realized that before! That's really interesting.
Yeah but if you look at the original story of some of the Disney adaptations, the Disney movies are way different.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movies do you like?
Monsters, Inc. is my favorite.
That's a great movie! Billy Crystal and John Goodman are phenomenal!
They really are. I couldn't believe Mr. Waternoose turned out to be on Randall's side.
I couldn't believe that either. Good thing he was captured and arrested in the end.
Did you see Monsters University?
I did! I liked Monsters, Inc. a little better, but Monsters University is still really funny.
I love how Sully tries to help Mike in the end with his scaring.
By helping him cheat in the scare games?
Yes. He did it out of love for his friend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes it was great!
Where did you see it at?
THe movies.
Oh, I watched it at home on DVR but I can image it was much better on the big screen.
Yes it was very entertaining.
Did you know that Disney World has a Beast castle you can eat at that looks just like the one in the movies?
No, have you been.
Yes. Its awesome.
I think i will buy the Beauty and the Beast movie when it comes out on DVD.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can we talk about Disney
Sure we can if you want
I do want too
What do you wanna say
I just like want another lion king so bad
Their was a sequel to the first though
Their was!
You have never seen it?!
Nope
Well then lets fix that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Sword and the Stone?
is that a Disney movie?
Yes, the one about King Arthur as a youth.
Oh yeah, I remember that one. The one with Merlin.
Yes, Merlin the wizard. Takes him on as an apprentice.
Yes, that was a pretty good one. Don't they turn into different kinds of animals.
Yes, fish, squirrels, rabbits.
I recall his brother and father treated him badly.
I think it was his adopted/foster parents.
And then he grabbed the sword out of the stone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like the movie Fantasia. I hadn't watched it for years until last night.
I haven't seen that movie in ages.
I love the different scenes and the music just makes it epic.
Isn't there a part with dinosaurs in that movie?
Yes, it's kind of the story of how they come to be and then go extinct.
Really, it covers that much?
Yeah, it was really interesting. Also, the part with the dancing mushrooms is awesome.
I remember that! I loved that one and then the part with the dancing hippos!
That part was great too! It makes me want to watch Fantasia 2000.
Oh, I almost forgot there was another one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
One Disney movie I really like but many don't seem to is The Lion King 2.
I know that movie. It's pretty good.
Yeah I actually prefer it more than the first one because I like the romance story between Kiara and Kovu.
It does seem to be more developed than Simba and Nala's romance.
Plus I like the actor who does Kovu's voice.
Who does Kovu's voice?
Jason Marsden. He is a pretty popular voice actor that does a lot of work for Disney shows and movies.
Oh I remember him. Didn't he do the voice for Max in A Goofy Movie?
Yeah that's him alright.
Cool. I liked that movie too a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Disney's movie The Chronicles of Narnia?
Yes I have seen that movie. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
Yes thats the first movie which has been released in the series back in 2005.
Yes i know, I saw the first part and I was hoping to see more, then came two more movies in the same series!
Yes everyone were longing to see another movie from the series, then came The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.
Yeah the second movie in the series was released back in 2008, that was too a good movie to watch.
That is true, that movie was really cool, movie had a faster story telling style than first part!
Yes I did noticed that too, it was really a brilliant movie. Graphics and editing were amazing.
But the most interesting movie in the series was The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, it was superb.
But what happened? They did not continue the series after they had released 3rd part back in 2010.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana   yet ?
I have  I  really liked  the chicken
It did  really  seem like he  stayed in  trouble
My  favorite is  how the water kept  putting  him back on  the boat
The  whole movie was  great    and I liked the message
I really liked  that  the rock from wwe  played  a  huge roll.
And he  did all of his own singing  .
I also  thought the   grandma  in this  was  quite  beuatiful  as she  became part of  the ocean
Did  you see  how she  was leading them as a  sting  ray
It was just a  great movie  about  family
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which character from any disney film would you pick to spend a day with?
Ah, the fairy godmother from Cinderella.
She is cute. She'd probably grant make some cool things happen.
Exactly my thoughts, and her power seems to be short lived so one day is enough.
Though who would not want more in that case?  Disney is great at creating a fantasy world you would love to be.
Some storylines I would not want to be living out though. So much peril in some.
That is a good point. Like snow white is always under attack.
Most fairytales Disney movies are based on were even darker.
Disney does do a good job and making them child friendly. Some still terrified me as a youngster.
Yes like Maleficent scared me in sleeping beauty terribly when I was little.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Zootopia?
I really liked it! It seemed different from a lot of Disney movies.
It was a change to have a modern story rather than something fairy-tale.
Well, all the characters are animals, so it's not super-realistic.
No, but it seemed like it was about modern life.
I really liked Judy's determination to become a police officer even though people doubted her.
Yeah, and it was fun watching her deal with criminals even though she's a little bunny.
And the animation was spectacular.
I know, the city looks so wild, with all the different areas for different animals!
I'd love to see Disney do something else in this style. Maybe we'll get a sequel?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Toy Story was a good movie did you like it
I did like it, I like the idea behind it
the toys coming alive and having feelings was neat
it was who did you like?
I like the potato heads the most
they were funny , like when they lost their noses and mouths
I know that part was really funny
can you imagine if they were real and kids could change them like that
I know that would be wild !
Buzzlightyear was a cool guy, I bet he was an expensive toy
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I have a confession.
Alright, I'm ready for it.
I cried during Inside Out.
I knew it!  I did too though.
It was just real sad because they were actual human characters going through normal human things.
Moving to another city is hard.
Plus being picked and feeling isolated.  That's why it was so effective.
The ending was wrapped up really nicely.
I loved the emotions!  Especially Joy.
Agreed.  I could use more Joy in my life!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like disney movies?
Yes i love them all
I really like the jungle book
I forgot all about that one
Its a really good movie
Its so hearwarming when he goes to see the humans at the end
Yes and a little sad too
Definitely sad
But overall a great movie
Yes it is
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the first Pixar film?
Toy Story
Was that in the 90's?
Yes it was
Are there any other Toy Story movies?
Yes. There is a second and third one.
Are they just as good as part 1?
No. The first one is the best
Cool. Are they good though?
Part 2 and 3 are both very clever films.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seen any good Disney movies recently?
Yeah I saw Tarzan.
What is your opinion of Tarzan?
I like Tarzan a lot.
Who is your favorite character?
I like the one that Rosie O'Donnell plays.
She is hilarious in that.
How about the music?
Yeah the music is wonderful by Phil Collins.
I can't wait to buy the DVD
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you seen the Jungle Book?
Which one? The animated one or the newer, live-action one?
They're both amazing, but I meant the newer one.
Yes, I just watched it with my family last week!
What was your favorite part? Did you have a favorite character?
I thought the temple scene with all the monkeys, the orangutan, Mowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera!
Did you mean King Louie and where Baloo and Bagheera have to rescue Mowgli?
Yes! I couldn't remember the orangutan's name - Louie!
Did you find Shere Khan scary?
Yes! I managed to act cool about it, but my little brother screamed at least once. He's really scared of being eaten by lions or tigers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have the song Let it Go stuck in my head!
I love that song! Idina Menzel has such a beautiful voice.
I love the scene in the movie where Elsa sings the song. I like watching everything turn frozen.
I like the fact that Olaf is the same snowman from when Elsa and Anna were little kids.
The scene with Anna and Elsa when they were little makes me sad.
When Elsa accidentally hits Anna with ice?
Yes! It makes me so sad after their parents die and Elsa stays locked in her room.
I feel like their parents did a bad job though. They should have tried to teach Elsa to control her magic, rather than locking her up.
I don't think they did a bad job, they just wanted to protect Anna.
I don't think they should have locked Elsa away though. That's not fair.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I didn't know Disney did Pirates of the Caribbean.
I didn't know that either until recently.
They also did Guardians of the Galaxy. I love that one.
Have you seen part 2 yet?
Not yet but from what I hear it's even better than the first one.
That's gonna be hard to top but then again it is Disney.
That's true. Have you seen all the Pirate movies?
Only the first two but I love Captain Jack Sparrow.
Me too. Johnny Depp is hilarious in that role.
Kiera Knightley was good in those films as well as Orlando Bloom.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When I was in high school Disney re-released some of their iconic animated movies.
I remember that. Did you see many of them?
I saw a lot of them. I recall going to The Jungle Book with a boy I had a crush on.
That must have been fun.
Well, I didn't know he was bringing three of his little nephews with us so it wasn't the romantic outing I had hoped for.
But you enjoyed the movie, yes?
Oh, of course! How can one not enjoy a Disney film?
Did you see the live action version of it?
No, but I hear Idris Elba was good.
He was, and I adore the song .... Bear Necessities!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know where many Disney stories come from?
Which ones?
The famous ones -- Cinderella and Snow White.
No, where do they come from?
They originally appeared in the stories by the Brothers Grimm!
Wow, that's interesting. Did the Disney group have any other sources of inspiration?
Definitely! They also borrowed from an even earlier compiler of stories.
That's amazing! Who is even an older source than the Brothers Grim?
That gentleman's name is Charles Perrault.
Yes, I heard he is the original source of Little Red Riding Hood.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
I don't have one
Why not?
I LIKE THEM ALLLLLLL!
Oh?  there isnt one that you don't like?
Well, maybe the little mermaid I dont like so much
Why's that?
I just dont like the story
Yea, they aren't for everyone
I agree!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Me and the kids watched Aladdin yesterday. I forgot how much I love that movie!
Yeah!  I loved that one as a kid!
It's still great as an adult, but you definitely notice different things.
Like what?
Abu is a pain in the butt!  It's because of him the chamber closed, and he didn't want to share with the street kids.
I never thought of that!  Were the songs still as good?
Yes!  My kids have been singing them all day today.
"A whole new world"!  Haha, I used to sing that constantly as a kid.  Must have driven my Mom nuts!
Me too!  Now I know how my Mom felt.  They're driving me nuts!
Would you mind if I borrow it?  I'd love to watch it again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I have watched the new Beauty and the Beast like seven times already.
I loved Dan Stevens as the beast!  But I love him in just about everything he does.
I had no idea he could sing!  He did a fantastic job on the song Evermore.
I have listened to that song on repeat.  But I have pretty much been listening to the whole soundtrack on repeat.
Emma Watson has a pretty good voice too.
I loved her as Belle, she looked the part perfectly.
I was afraid I would hate all of the new songs, but I actually loved them.
I'm a pretty hardcore classic Disney fan so I was worried too.
I almost left the movie crying during some scenes.
I loved that they answered some of the questions that needed answering from the cartoon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Disney Princess?
It is hard for me to choose but I think I like Belle the best. And you?
I like Ariel. I think it is the songs in The Little Mermaid that I like best.
They do get stuck in your head!
Yes, but I think that it was is great about Disney movies. The songs!
With the new Beauty and The Beast movie out I am definately hearing those songs floating around again.
Why do like Belle?
She seems content with very little. Just makes herself happy. Why do you like Ariel?
She is also very happy with very little, she collects trash!
I guess they are very similar!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what's your favourite Disney movie then?
Mine would probably have to be Lilo and Stitch.
I like that one too! Why is it your favourite?
I really love aliens and Stitch is so cute! Which one is your favourite?
Gotta go for The Lion King.
A classic - do you just like the songs or does the story do something special for you?
A bit of both really - I mean, who doesn't like "Hakuna Matata"
So true. When Mufasa dies at the start, so sad.
Yeah, really heart-wrenching moment. Bring tears to my eyes everytime.
Same here.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I really like Pete's Dragon.
The new one?
Yes, the one that just came out last year.
I really liked how they kept the story in line with the time period.
Yeah, they didn't try to make it more modern. But the dragon was top notch!
It was a really charming and heartwarming story.
I thought it was very authentic myself.
I liked the car chase scene at the end.
That was my favorite as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the remake of Pete's Dragon?
Yes I did. Did you like it?
Well it was different than the original. I can tell you that originally I wasn't happy they remade it.
I never saw the original so I had nothing to compare it to.
It was actually in many ways different and that was a good thing because I felt like I didn't have to compare the two.
I really liked how they showed that there were lots of dragons actually living in harmony somewhere.
Sure, but I thought that the relationship with Pete and the family that found him was great. They really developed that storyline
I am glad they didn't make it a musical.
I thought that the CGI was really great. The dragon looked so real.
The CGI was fantastic. It was like the dragon was really there interacting with the people. He was not cartoon looking either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who  is your favorite character in Aladdin?
It would have to be the genie.
Why the genie?
He has a lot of personality.
Do you have a favorite song from the movie?
I loved the song with Prince Ali.
Mine was A Whole New World because it was romantic.Did you find the movie to have a good romance story line?
I did.
Do you think the genie should be set free?
Yes!!!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana yet?
Sort of, I've only seen a little bit.
Why? The whole movie is great.
Honestly, I just turn it off after a while!
Wow, the music is amazing though!
Oh, yeah I like "How Far I'll Go" a lot.
Me too! I think the message is adorable.
Yeah, the whole theme of the movie is cute from what I've seen.
You need to see it all to understand the full message!
I know, I really need to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the new Beauty and the Beast movie and it was amazing!
I have been wanting to see that!
I suggest you go! I went with my cousins and am so glad I saw it!
Was it like the original?
Very similar, but different in some ways.
Like what? Would a fan of the original still like it?
I think so! There was more character development for Belle, and her father.
That's interesting!
Yeah! Belle was the inventor in this one, but it was a good addition to the plot!
I'll definitely go see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who's your favorite Princess?
Aurora
Which movie was Aurora in?
SLeeping Beauty.
Is that the one with the Dwarves?
No, that's Snow White, silly.
That's the one with the poisoned apple.
Seriosuly you don't know? Sleeping Beauty is the spindle. How do you not know this?
I don't know. It's been a while.
What do you think Cinderella was about?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I got stuck watching Beuty and the Beast last week!
Poor you
Oh, it really wasn't too bad.
Is it the same as the original
It has some new music, but the story is the same.
At least something is new
The animation was really good
Better technology today
I disliked the new Gaston
The old one wasn't very likeable either
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Disney was inspired by Shakespeare?
What? I thought they took inspiration from like fairytales and stuff.
Well, that too, but some people say The Lion King is basically just Hamlet with lions.
I guess that makes sense, with the whole father dying angle and such.
Yes, and then Simba has to eventually slay his uncle--who is maybe married to his mother now?
I think Simba has a happier ending than Hamlet does, though.
That's certainly true, he doesn't wind up dying for one!
And he gets to sing better songs and hook up with Nala in the end.
I shipped Nala and Simba so hard as a kid.
Well, Nala was surprisingly cute for an animated lion!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, why so sad?
Oh, just a little heartbroken and disappointed.
Why's that?
Well, I haven't seen a lot of Disney movies so my best friend was exposing me to everything post late-90s I've missed out on but now she's no longer talking to me.
That's a bummer. Which ones did you two watch so far?
Lilo & Stitch, Hercules, Atlantis, Treasure Planet, and Mulan was the very last one we watched together.
I'm quite surprised you hadn't seen most of those. Would you like me to recommend some?
That's what she said. No, really, and yeah I guess.
If you want to see some really enjoyable animated ones like those then I'd recommend Chicken Little, Big Hero 6, and Zootopia. For something more live action... Tomorrowland, McFarland USA, and Into The Woods are absolute must see movies.
She also highly recommended Into The Woods so I think I'll start with it. How can I not with the likes of Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, Johnny Depp, James Corden, Richard Glover, Chris Pine, and Tracey Ullman in it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite series of Disney movies?
Pirates of the Caribbean, without a doubt.
Okay, is any particular one of the movies a favorite of yours?
I'd have to say that At World's End was my favorite of the Pirates movies.
Okay, why is that your favorite?
Because it has the most intense and wild ship battle.
Oh, when the Black Pearl and FLying Dutchman battle each other while circling the goiant whirlpool?
Yes, I love the action and the music is fantastic.
And of course, the sword fighting is excellent of course.
Yeah, I particularly like Barbossa performing Will and Elizabeth's marriage while in the midst of combat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes! I loved the remake, and the music was fantastic.
I could listen to the soundtrack all day.
Me too. I think I loved this version of Gaston the most.
He was obnoxious in the most adorable way..
So was Belle's father.
The part where he met Beast was one of my favorite parts.
He did look menacing, didn't he.
But, that ending! Those dresses.
Very well done, and such beautiful colors were used.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your favorite Disney films?
The Little Mermaid. Aladdin. Pocahontas. Cinderella. The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Peter Pan . Snow White
Those are all good ones.
I  also really like Tarzan and The Lion King.
They both have a jungle them, do you also love The Jungle Book?
I like the newer version better than the animated film but yes that too.
What do you like about them so much?
Well Tarzan was the first time that Disney changed up the formula some.
How did they do that exactly?
It was the first time they did not have the characters sing the song themselves. You will notice it is phil colins singing the songs not any character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new movie Moana?
No but I've heard it is good.
Yeah, I loved it I've seen it many times since they added it to Netflix.
Are there any good actors in it?
Dwayne Johnson, Alan Tudyk, and Auli'i Cravalho is in it plus my favorite football player Troy Polamalu.
Wow, they are all good actors what is the movie about?
It's a musical that takes place in Polynesia and Moana and her pet take a trip to Maui.
Is there a lot of good music in the movie?
Yeah the whole movie is full of music, my favorite song was "How Far I'd Go". My one year old niece dances during the whole movie.
That's awesome yeah I'm going to watch that tonight with my daughter. Thanks for telling me about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Moana?
I thought it was wonderful!
What did you like best about it?
I loved the meaning of it and the female empowerment.
I agree with you, I would love to watch it with my girls.
Let me know what they think of the song "How Far I'll Go?"
Will do! I heard the soundtrack is wonderful.
Oh yes, the songs will stick in your head for days.
Thats what makes Disney movies so great.
Well said.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Disney movies?
The cartoon ones of the live action?
Cartoon ones.
I loved the sort of golden age one.
Like what?
Bambi I think is the epitome of the golden age of Disney.
That is the one with the deer that has his mom die, and the cute skunk.
Yep, the skunk that is always falling in love.
I loved having those old Disney movies on VHS.
It was like a treat getting to see a new one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait until the newest Little Mermaid comes out.
It looks fantastic from what I've read online.
Who is directing it?
According to imdb, Chris Bouchard and Blake Harris.
Who's staring in it?
The main stars are Gina Gershon, Shirley MacLane and William Moseley.
Wow, quite the cast!
I know right!
I can't wait to see it.
I suggest watching the original in the meantime!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you have a favorite Disney movie growing up?
I always loved The Lion King.
I can't watch The Lion King because it makes me cry.
I cry when Mufasa gets trampled, but the rest of the movie is so good.
Scar still scares me even though I'm an adult now.
When I was little, I was scared of the elephant Boneyard.
Seeing the elephant bones still creeps me out.
The hyenas are so goofy though, I don't think that it can be too scary.
I also get scared at the end when Simba almost falls into the fire.
Yes, but at the end it always ends so happily.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard Cars 3 is releasing soon.
Yes, I read about it online.
I wonder how does the story take you in the latest flick.
Well, it sure will be full of humor and life lessons.
Any idea whether they are adding any new characters to the story?
I remember reading they are adding a new race car named Cruz Ramirez
What does Cruz do in the movie?
Well, obviously must be around to help McQueen.
Do you think it will be better than the previous two instalments?
I sure hope so and wish the movie does well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That new person at work is going to end up with a nose like Pinocchio!
What? Made of wood?
No, I mean if he doesn't stop lying his nose will grow like Pinocchio's did.
Oh, I follow you now!
He had a tough time poor old Pinocchio.  He was led astray!
Remember Candlewick when Pinocchio goes to Pleasure Island?
I do, he was the guy who turned in to a donkey?
That's the one, I though he deserved it.
I wasn't a massive fan of Mangiafuoco either.
No but the scene with the dancing puppets was great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where does The Little Mermaid take place?
Under the sea.
I love movies that take place in the sea.
Me too. The Little Mermaid is one of the best sea movies of all time.
I like the colors and the characters in that movie
Have you ever been on the California Adventures ride?
No, I didn't even know it had one.
The Little Mermaid is my favorite Disney cartoon.
What is the main character;s name?
Ariel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you remember those Not Quite Human movies?
No. When were those from? The 1980s again?
Yeah. They were on the Disney Channel. I think, made-for-TV.
Okay. Well, what about them?
Well... I liked them. At the time, anyway. There were three of them.
What were they about?
A scientist creates an android, and tells everyone it's his son. The android tries to figure out how to act like a person.
Oh, so you identified with the android?
I... well. Maybe.
I bet his name was something clever like "Chip."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that old movie Bambi?
No. I heard about but i haven't seen that movie.
I like that movie characters very much, Could you tell me how can i get that movie online or youtube?
I don't know exactly but you can watch the movie online stream.
Ok. I will check it out and i'm eager to watch the movie.
Yeah. I too eager to watch this movie.
Wow. So nice of you. When we will start to watch the movie at online stream.?
Yeah. I will tell you now i started to search in online stream.
Really?. Check it out soon i'm waiting.
Yeah i'm searching. Wait for moment. We will watch and enjoy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Beauty and the Beast yet?
No, but I heard it was almost the same as the first one!
It really was, except with live action characters!!
How neat! Id love to see how the girl from Harry Potter did as Belle!
She was outstanding! The man they cast as the beast did really well too!
I always loved him! Guess I'm into the strong, silent type!
Im pretty sure my favorite part of Disney movies are usually the end. I love seeing a romance blossom!
Me too! It always gives me the warm and fuzzies!
So, I guess this means you're renting Beauty and The Beast tonight?
You guessed right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Disney movies. I see them even though I'm am adult and have no kids.
I love them, too.
I remember going to see Beauty and the Beast, the animated version, in college.
You don't think of college aged kids going to G rated movies.
Well I did and I loved it.
I did as well.
Have you seen the new live action Beauty and the Beast?
The one with Emma Watson?
Yes, that one.
No, but I hear it's great and I plan to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know they released Cars 3 recently?
Wow, I can't believe they made another Cars movie!
I agree. Too many sequels can be annoying.
It can never compare the to original either.
The first one was so great on its own, so I couldn't agree more.
I wonder what they wrote this one about?
Supposedly Lightning McQueen loses to a new racer and he has to fight his way back to the top.
It just seems like a repeat of past movies.
It does. I'm sure it's okay, but they should leave it alone after this.
I probably won't end up seeing it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was looking through my attic over the weekend and found some old VHS videos.
What did you find?
My old Pinocchio video.
I remember that. Parts of it kind of scared me.
Yeah, it's surprising how many kids movies have scary elements in them.
The whole Monstro thing freaked me out.
You mean when the whale swallowed him?
Yes. That and when they were turned into donkeys.
What was up with that?
Trying to teach us about following rules, but what a scare tactic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why was Moana so bad?
What?  Bad, how do you mean?
I just didn't like the film.  It was boring.
I completely disagree, why do you say that?
It took forever to get to point.
You mean that the island really wasn't bad, just misunderstood?
Right.  Spent way too much time on Maui dinking around.
You're probably on your own island with this stance.
Hey, just saying, sometimes Disney dropped the ball and they did on this one.
You're entitled to your opinion I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you like cars?
the first was okay
what about the second and third?
I didn't bother watching the third.
yeah, it really is not worth it
the 2nd was bad enough
I don't know why they even made a third
they should make more wall-e or even brave
yeah or any other Pixar movie
exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess what movie is coming out in 2018!
What movie? Is it Disney?
Yes. Incredibles 2!
Wow that is so exciting!
I know. The Incredibles was one of my favorites as a kid.
Wasn't it everyones?
True. I bet the theater will be packed with adults.
I hate that we have to wait till next year.
Yeah. I think it will be worth the wait though.
I'm sure it will be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie "John Carter"?
No, I have never heard of it.
It is actually a Disney movie, but not for kids.  It is Science Fiction.
Really?  Is it a good movie?
Yes, I actually really liked it.  Its about a guy who finds an portal to travel to Mars and all sorts of action takes place.
I love alien movies!  I wish I would have heard of this sooner.
I don't know why it didn't do well at the box office.  It was a really good movie.
Maybe it wasn't advertised enough.
I don't think it was.  It is not just about aliens and science fiction.  There is a love story involved too.
That sounds great.  I will rent it this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in Guardians of the Galaxy 2?
Definitely Baby Groot.
He's mine, too. I think he;s so cute.
I know. I loved the opening of the movie when he was dancing around.
My favorite part was the pushing buttons scene.
That was really funny.
I didn't like it in the ending credits when they showed him as a teenager.
I didn't watch the credits.
Well, he was a teenager and wasn't' cute anymore.
Too bad. I was hoping he would still be Baby Groot if they make another sequel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
That's hard, let me think about it. Well, I like a few: Aladdin, Mary Poppins, and Alice in Wonderland.
What do you like about Aladdin?
The music and the genie--the genie is awesome!
Did you see any of the sequels?
Yeah, did you?
Yeah, but not in a really long time.
How many were there, three?
I think so. I don't remember them as much as the original, which I've probably seen a hundred times!
I think I've seen it a thousand times!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember A Goofy Movie?
Yes, I still watch it sometimes.
I felt bad for Goofy in it, but sometimes he embarrassed Max a lot.
I know. He didn't mean any harm, though.
Powerline made some really good music.
Definitely! That song "I2I" is still good.
Max's performance as Powerline was probably worth getting in trouble for.
Remember when his friend made the leaning tower of "cheeze-a?" It always looked so good.
Animated canned spray cheese, a true delicacy.
It's better than getting chased by Bigfoot like they do in the movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes! Wasn't it great!
Yes, but I would have preferred they make it a little more unique?
I loved how close they stuck to the original story. What would you have liked to see?
I don't know, but it didn't have any surprises, even the songs were the same.
They changed the wording of the songs some, but not a lot.  Don't you think it was good that they didn't completely change them?
I guess, I just wish it was a little more different than the cartoon.
The cartoon version was one of my favorites when I was little so I was very happy with this one.  Will you buy it when it comes out on DVD?
No, I didn't like it enough to buy it.
That's too bad, I can't wait to own it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the new Disney movies?
Like Frozen? Not really.  I  like some of the earlier stuff, like Mulan.
That was a great movie- girl power!
Yes, although the really early ones, like Snow White and Cinderella were about rescuing the princess!
They were old fashioned-but the music was great in Snow White
Although when I was a kid Bambi made me so sad.
It still makes me sad, and so does Dumbo.
You know what else I like? Pocahontas.
I love that one.  Colors of the Wind is a great song!
Also, Aladdin. The genie was so funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember that old movie about the fish that got lost?
Oh, do you mean finding nemo?
Yes! That was a really good movie.
Oh, I agree. Ellen Degeneres is so funny.
Did you go and see the seqeul?
Oh, do you mean Finding Dory?
Yes, that's what it's called. That was the one when Dory had to go and find her own family.
Yes, I did see that one. It was even better than the original.
Really? I would have said Finding Nemo was better.
Well, it's just a matter of opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Inside Out was the best movie Disney did.
C'mon, you can't say that!
Yes, I can.
What about The Lion King?
No, Inside out is better.
How so?
They touch on mental health! It's the first Disney movie to ever care about something.
Guess you're kind of right.
I'm super right! The character? Relatable! The side characters? Even more relatable.
Jealousy was pretty funny, I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch The Mighty Ducks as a kid?
Yes, but I mainly watched D2: The Mighty Ducks because I had a copy on VHS.
I loved all those movies, they made me interested in ice hockey even though I'm Australian.
I heard they named a real team after the movies, is that true?
Yes, there is a professional ice hockey team named The Anaheim Ducks.
The kid who played Charlie in those movies went onto to bigger things didn't he? Like Dawson's Creek or something?
Yes, he was also in that show called Fringe. His name is Joshua Jackson.
I haven't seen Emilio Estevez in anything else since he played the coach in these movies, have you?
No, he was in these three Mighty Ducks movies then seemed to disappear.
I think he's been in a few things but I guess he retired.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard that the Incredibles 2 is coming out next year?
I did not, I wonder what they are planning to do.  Do you think they will have the characters age?
I'm not sure, many of the Disney movies do have characters that seem to progress in life, but the Incredibles already was at a good age for all the characters.
I wonder how older Jak will look and act!
Me too.  I really liked his animated short "Jak Attack" with the babysitter.
That was definitely one of my favorites too.
Maybe they will age him, but get a famous actor to do the voiceover.
That would be a good opportunity to do that.
I personally really like the villains in movies like this.
I agree, the movie really only does well if you have a good antagonist!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes! I loved the new live action version!
I thought the actors were great. Emma Watson was a perfect Belle.
Yes, her singing really surprised me. What did you think about Beast?
He was good, too. Did you know he was the guy from Downton Abbey?
Really? I didn't realize that! I couldn't tell under the costume.
Yeah, that's when I realized it. The effects when he changed back were really great.
You're right; the special effects were really well done, and so were the songs.
Yes! I loved that they included the original songs and added new ones, too.
My favorite song was the one by Celine Dion in the credits. That was a nice touch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mulan has got to be my favorite Disney movie.
Really? I like the Princess and the Frog the most.
That was a good one, too. Tiana and Mulan are both very strong characters.
Agreed, and their sidekicks really bring out the best in them.
Mushu and Cricket were great in Mulan.
Ray was my favorite sidekick in the Princess and the Frog.
It seems that a lot of Disney movies have a lot of great sidekicks.
You're right. For some people, Olaf is the main reason they like the Frozen franchise so much.
I can see why. He is very lovable and provided great comic relief.
I know. I'm just happy he didn't melt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like all of Disney's direct to DVD sequels are a waste of time.
What do you mean? The company certainly profits from them.
Yeah, but it should be about more than the money; the story should mean something.
Well, there must be one good direct to DVD sequel.
Cinderella's are terrible, Bambi's aren't very good, Aladdin's are just average, Belle's was terrible and so was Ariel's, so.
Yes, but wasn't the Rescuers Down Under a sequel?
Oh, I forgot about that one! Isn't that the one where they're in Australia?
Yes, and they help the little boy and there's an eagle.
Okay, you have a point, that one is really good.
I loved Miss Bianca and Bernard, they were so cute!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe they are making another Toy Story!
I am a little worried about it.  I thought the third one was perfect.
The third one made me cry!  I thought it wrapped up the movies perfectly.
I'm not sure how they are going to do the voices for all of the characters since some of the voice actors have passed away.
I didn't know that.  Which characters have passed away?
I'm pretty sure the voice for slinky dog and maybe Hamm.
Those are pretty big characters.  It will be interested to see what they do with them.
I wonder what they plot line will be, since Andy gave the toys away.
Maybe it will start with the little girl being older again.
Maybe it will be some kind of flashback movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the best Johnny Depp movie is a Disney movie?
Someone can't "know" that, it's an opinion.
Sure, but it's a very strongly supported opinion.
Okay, point taken. I have to admit though, I don't know any Disney movies with Johnny Depp.
Pirates of the Caribbean!
That's so true! The set and costume design for that movie are insane.
So good, right? It's so gritty and real feeling.
Yeah, it's probably the only Disney movie that has ever truly scared me.
Disney movies tend to be a bit more lighthearted.
Yeah, it's a testament to Disney's production that they could produce such a film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about some of the theories on Frozen and how other disney characters make appearances in the movie?
I have heard that Flynn and Rapunzel are in one of the scenes preceeding the coronation.
Yes, there is also a theory about connection to other movies?
Is that the part where they say Ariel used to play in the shipwreck from Ana and Elsa's parents?
Yes, but also that perhaps her parents were not dead, and were on a stranded Island.
I heard that one too, that they were like Jane and Tarzan?
I am not sure about that, but I heard that the reason Rapunzel was there was because Elsa's parents were traveling to her wedding when they died.
I heard that one too, very interesting fan theories!
Also I heard that the Let it Go song was added after they nearly finished the movie.
I do not think that is true, but if it is, that is cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the name of the movie with the house and the balloons?
"Up"
Oh that's right - I forgot the name of it.  I love that movie.
I know, the old man is so cute.
Ya, and it was kind of sad when they did the flashbacks with his wife.
That's what made the ending so great.
Right, when the house lands on beside the waterfall.
His wife would have loved that!
Ya it made me cry a little.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that interview with Tarentino on The Hateful 8?
No. How was it?
He totally bashed Disney.
Why?
Apparently his movie got pulled from a few cinemas.
What does Disney have to do with that?
They threatened theaters that if Star Wars didn't play in "x" amount of showings they'd pull it.
What bullies!
I'm still going to watch Episode VIII
Duh!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you feel about Maleficient?
I dont know it was weird.
Angelina Jolie is a good actor though.
She is but the movie was just not that good.
I agree some of the scenes were bizarre.
I dont think they are lining up a 2nd one.
No and I am not sure they ever looked into it.
She should do a better role.
Has she ever been a voice actor for a Disney film.
Theres no possible way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like watching the old Disney movie Mulan again.
You mean the 1998 or 2004 film?
I mean the first Mulan movie released in 1998. After my recent trip back from China, I started to feel nostalgic.
I see, I used to like the songs in the Mulan movie.
My favourite song is "I'll make a man out of you"
Oh I like that one too.
Yes, it is an oldie but a goodie.
Wow, now I really feel like watching the film again soon.
Why don't you drop by my house later, I'll dig out my dvd.
Sure, see you later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hey man
Disney is getting good with releases
Have they always been though
Eh
What?
Sometimes they were bad
How
They took forever
I guess
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Do you like disney movies?
Yeah sure.
Me too.
What was the last one you saw?
I watched Hercules recently.
I haven't seen that one in ages.
It's a really good one.
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
would you be interested in a disney movie party?
oh yikes. it definitely depends on the movie!
what kind of disney movies do you like? i have them all
something with a stellar soundtrack!
what about hercules?
oh gosh, that's a classic. i could be down for some hercules.
101 dalmatians?
yeah, not quite my thing.
i guess we'll stick with hercules, then
and that's the gospel truth!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know there is yet another Toy Story in the works.
After how the last one ended?
Yep, even though the toys were given away.
And Andy went off to college.
I wonder if it will be set up, with the little girl he gave them too?
I imagine. I hope not back in that play school.
That was so scary!
I do not know how, but they managed to make me fear pre-school. At least for the toys.
I was so stressed at the end when they toys almost got crushed at the dump.
I liked that the bad guy bear ended up as a hood ornament.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Frozen is a great Disney movie, but I actually thought Tangled was better.
Really?  I loved Frozen!
Don't get me wrong.  I liked Frozen, too, but I thought it was a little over-hyped.
I have never seen Tangled, so I wouldn't know.
You are missing out!  It's adorable!
Isn't it the story of Rapunzel?
Yes.  She's a teenager who grew up thinking the woman who raised her was her mother...but she wasn't!
Frozen has a talking snowman though...
Yeah, well Tangled has a funny horse named Maximus.
I'll watch it and be the judge as to which is better!
XXXXXXXXXXX
We just watched Moana.
I love that movie.
Me too. Hey Hey made me laugh so many times.
My favorite character was Maui.
I really enjoyed the scene in the beginning when the ocean opens around her.
I loved it when her grandmother returns to her in the ocean.
My daughters love the scene where she returns the heart to Te Fiti
The songs are also so great. We love Thank You, as well as How far I'll go
It has some beautiful messages.
Its a really great movie for adults and kids.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Disney movies?
I am a big fan.
I like the ones with animals as main characters.
Lasy and the Tramp was a favorite for me.
I almost forgot about that one.
When Lady and the mutt share the spaghetti - so romantic.
What about the Jungle Book with Baloo the bear?
I like the cartoon Baloo.
The new Jungle Book with CGI is pretty amazing.
The story is a bit different but I loved it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever notice that nobody worries about Jasmine when she goes missing in Aladdin?
What do you mean?
She snuck out of the house to go into the village and nobody noticed.
Didn't the guards find her?  Isn't that why they went into the city?
No, Jafar sent the guards to find Aladdin.  They found Jasmine by accident!
I never thought of that!  Maybe they thought she was still in the castle?
Maybe, but that castle was pretty poorly guarded.  She didn't see any guards on her way out and climbed that wall easily!
Maybe they trusted the people??
I guess, but it seems a little strange that she was the princess and fairly unguarded.
A little odd, but it sure made for a great movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to rewatch all of the Pirates of the Caribbean.
They are amazing, we do need a new marathon now that there is another one out.
I don't think they could have picked a better actor for Captain Jack.
I agree, the entire movie series would be different had he been played by someone else.
Have you heard if Dead Men Tell No Lies will be the last?
I have, I hope it's one of those things where in a year or two we'll hear they are making another.
I guess the way the story plays out it could just be the beginning of the end. Meaning we'll get another couple movies at least.
That would be fantastic, I'm not ready to say goodbye to all of them yet.
As long as they don't start doing a bunch of weird spin offs, those are rarely ever good.
Oh I don't know, I'd love some spin offs of some shows I miss a lot, just to feel the story live a bit again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pirates of the Carribean is awesome.
It's an epic movie, what more can we say?
It's probably the most epic movie Disney has made in a while.
Probably the most epic movie EVER!
Sword fights and cannon battles. You can't really get any more epic than that.
And it's one of the series of movies Disney has made that the second and third movies aren't bad films.
That's true, I really do like Pirates 2 and 3.
Which one was your favorite?
Dead Man's Chest.
I liked At World's End.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the movie, 'Moana?'
It was a really cool movie, and quite possibly the best one of the past few years.
Better than 'Frozen?'
Yes, for sure.  The characters and music of 'Moana' were superior to that of 'Frozen.'
What about 'Let it Go?'
'Let it Go' was catchy, but it was almost like the chorus was written, then the rest of the song was an after thought.
Which song from 'Moana' did you like the best?
'How Far I'll Go' was so good.  It also had a beginning, middle, and end to it.
I like that song too.  Who wrote it again?
The talented, Lin-Manuel Miranda!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movie has made you the saddest?
Probably The Lion King. I saw it when I was really little.
Me too. It was definitely sad when Mufasa died!
I felt so bad for poor, sweet Simba.
It wasn't all sad though, it was funny when he was with Timon and Pumbaa.
They were so hilarious. I love "Hakuna Matata," too.
My favorite scene is when Simba sings "I Just Can't Wait to be King."
He is being sort of obnoxious during that song, but it is adorable!
And Zazu's bickering at him makes it even funnier.
Even though it is a sad movie, I still love a lot of it, and it definitely has funny parts!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Disney's Brave?
Yeah, it seems like it was very popular when it came out.
I think it did make a lot of money.
It had a nice song or two in it as well.
There was something in it that spoke to the nature of mother -daughter relationships.
Right! Didn't the mother get turned into a bear?
Sure but it was accidental.
Merida was really loved by her parents, but a lot was expected from her.
She rose to the challenge though.
In a magical way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could have one pet from a disney movie what would it be?
Baloo from the jungle book.
Good choice but I don't think you could have Baloo as a pet he's too much of a free spirit.
That's true, I mostly just want to be his friend and have him teach me how to itch by back on trees.
I can see where you're coming from. I loved the Bear-Necessities as a kid. I would drive my mom crazy singing it.
Yea, I used to sing "Be Like You" all the time. King Louie was pretty cool too.
Yea he was really funny. I always thought that place with all the monkeys seemed kind of fun.
Except in the new version with the giant King Louie. It looked more threatening to me.
Oh yea definitely. I would just want to live with the wolves the whole time.
Oh the wolf parents were so cute!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the 101 dalmatians?
Yeah I saw both the cartoon and the real life movie.
Which one was your favorite?
I liked the real life on the best.
Oh me too, that was very good.
Glen Close was very good in that.
I agree.
Did you see 102 dalmatians?
No I did not.
Yeah I don't recommend it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I never saw Disney's Hercules movie, did you?
Yes, I actually did. My one son got it for a birthday.
Was it any good?
Yes, it was a cute movie.
Do you have the DVD or VHS?
DVD, why you want to borrow it?
Yes, I'd like to see it.
Okay, it's a good watch for any age.
Do you know who does the voices?
No, sorry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the music in Little Mermaid?
I think it's one of the best parts of the movie.
Do you have a favorite song from it?
I mostly like Part Of Your World.
My favorite is Under the Sea. Do you think it's a good song?
It is and all of the music in the movie is good.
Do you think the story had a good plot?
It was a really good plot.
Is this a ovie you would see more than once?
Absolutely!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Disney is making a fourth Toy Story movie?
I hadn't heard that. When is it coming out?
It'll be in theaters next July I think.
How long has it been since the last movie?
Toy Story 3 came out in 2010 I think.
Seven years seems like a long time to go between sequels.
Yeah, but I think an even longer period passed between when Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 came out.
That's true. Do you think it's a good idea for them to make another sequel?
I'm not sure. I thought Toy Story 3 wrapped up the franchise pretty well so I'm surprised they're doing another one.
I'm surprised too. I hope it's good but I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think disney's greatest film triumph is?
Hard to say they have had so many hits.
But if you had to pick one.
I suppose Snow white and the seven dwarfs because it took so much to get it made.
Ya at the time it was super innovative and new.
Pretty nuts when you think about how much effort disney had to putin to get this type of animated feature of the ground.
Ya he was an impressive guy. So glad he did work so hard, I love disney films.
Agreed, he was progressive for his day. Not sure he was always the nicest but he got things done.
I certainly feel his films are some of the most treasured of all time.
So many people grew up with disney films and disney world /land hard not to love him and all his film work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hear that Disney is doing a live action version of Mulan.
Really, when is it supposed to come out.
2018, I think.
Oh, I wish it was sooner, I loved the Beauty and the Beast live action movie.
I wonder who will be in it.
I don't know, but I am sure they will find people that fit the parts.
I hope they include some of the musical numbers.
I agree, they make the movies more fun!
I hope they make a lot more live action movies.
Me too, they are so much fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
People seem to think that Disney is only recently doing live action movies.
I know. They have terrific animated movies but they've also been doing live action for many, many years.
I loved seeing 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.
Oh yes, Kirk Douglas was really good in it.
I also went on the ride in Disneyland but kind of freaked out.
How so?
You go inside a really tight, enclosed replica of the submarine and I discovered that I have a touch of claustrophobia.
That's one heck of a time to find that out.
It sure is. Good thing I was a cute little 4 year old when it happened and everyone took pity on me when I sort of freaked out.
Cute goes far in getting you out of things!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the live action version of Beauty and the Beast?
No, but I really love Emma Watson.
Me too.  I think she will do a good job in the role.
She's come a long way from her Harry Potter days.
This is very true.  Have you seen the trailer for Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge?
Yes!  Did you see on the news where Johnny Depp went to Disneyland and dressed up like Capt. Jack Sparrow?
Yes!  I thought that was really cool.
Yeah, I wish I was there during that.
He's had some troubles lately, but I am still very much a fan.
I agree, I can't wait to see this movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I just loved the lion king! What about you?
I'd have to say Aladdin. I think the old movies are better than the new ones.
I'm not too sure about that. Moana was great!
I think they're good, but the old ones have a more nostalgic feel to them.
Well I see what you mean, but watching the new ones bring that feeling back to me in a way.
What do you mean?
Well they all have a warm theme to them so watching them makes me feel like a kid again.
Do you think they're better than the old movies?
I think they both have their place, but I still prefer them to the old movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My kids were watching Cinderella a few days ago, and now I've got the songs stuck in my head.
Oh, yeah? Which ones?
The one sung by the mice when they're making her dress. "Cinderelly, Cinderelly, night and day it's Cinderelly."
Oh, that's a cute song.
And the song by the fairy godmother, "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo!"
That one would probably get on my nerves if it was stuck in my head.
Exactly. At least it's not the off-key song by the evil stepsister.
Well, now that you mention it, that song will probably be stuck in my head!
Oops, sorry about that!
It's fine. I'll just think about Moana songs instead to get rid of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who are some of your favorite animated male heroes?
Well, my favorite is probably Hercules.
Oh, that's a good choice. I loved Tate Donovan as his voice actor.
Another one is probably Aladdin.
I agree. The cast and music in that movie was incredible.
Who are some of your favorites?
Well, I'd have to say Hiro from Big Hero 6 is my favorite.
Yes, that's a good choice too. That movie is really good.
Do you know if they are going to make a sequel?
I'm not sure but I really wish they would. I would go see it definitely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new live action Beauty and the Beast?
No I did not see it in the theaters. I was too busy and didnt have time
It just came out on DVD
Really? I will have to go get it so I can see it!
Yes! You should! It was so good!
Really? Was it as good as the animated?
Yes! It was amazing!
What was your favorite part about the live action? Dont spoil anything!
I really liked that the beast was featured more
I will go and get it after work!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What does the movie title "The BFG" stand for?
The Big Friendly Giant
Oh that makes sense.  I didn't see it.
It was a pretty good movie.  Directed by Steven Spielberg.
Oh wow, I didn't know that.
Yes, it got great reviews too, but didn't do as big as it should at the box office.
Ya, I didn't see many commercials for it.  But remember the poster.
Well you should see it - it was a great movie.
Oh for sure I will.  especially since I know who directed it.
Ya - he is a great director.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Zootopia was such a good movie!
One of Disney's best original animated movies!
It was a lot more serious then I thought it was going to be.
You mean the content of the story?
Yeah the story content was really adult but surrounded by cute cuddly animals.
I was really surprised by that but in a good way.
Disney presented Zootopia in a way where parents could enjoy the movie while their kids could too.
I know, I thought some of the themes were a little too much for children, but I think the overall look of the movie really appealed to them.
It definitely appealed to me as a parent and I know my kids loved Disney's Zootopia. It was our favorite Disney movie and maybe even favorite movie overall movie of 2016!
That's really high praise! I really liked Zootopia too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you prefer Cinderella or Snow White?
Wow that's like choosing between my favorite children, Cinderella if forced to choose.
Interesting, I'm firmly in the Snow White camp, why do you prefer Cinderella?
I guess the story just seemed better, had a certain level of magic with the shoes and the the evil step sister were brilliant.
I would argue that the seven dwarves supercede anything in Cinderella.
Don't get me wrong, they were the best part of Snow White, but still Cinderella was better.
But if there wasn't a Snow White, there may have never been a Cinderella, so that should trump everything else.
That's a good point, Snow White did come first, I would simply state that Disney's storytelling only got better.
No way Snow White was the first and is still the pinnacle of the Disney Princesses.
I would throw a curve ball of sorts and say that Sleeping Beauty is better than both.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Disney makes a lot more than just cartoons?
Really? You mean since they bought Lucas Films and Marvel?
Before then. They made some classic live action films.
Huh, never heard of any.
You might have, like Mary Poppins.
I love that movie! That is Disney?
Yes,  the same animators for the old cartoon did the animated parts in that movie.
Are there any other I may know?
Tons, like the Shaggy Dog.
That is a Disney movie?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite animated Disney Movie?
I would have to say the Lion King.
Why is that?
Because it is a work of art all the animals, the music plus the father son relationship of Simba and his dad is great!
What did you not like about the movie?
It´s very obvious, that Simba´s dad dies.
Other than Simba which is your favorite character int he movie?
I can´t choose one, I have two, Timon and Pumbaa they are hilarious.
Which is your favorite scene?
The End, when the new baby is born and the circle of life starts again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello
Want to do something
Not right now
Why not
Watching a movie
What movie
I am watching Hercules
Having fun
Sure am
XXXXXXXXXXX
What about the Disney movie Milan?
I think Milan was a good movie.
Do you think Disney will do a remake of the movie or a live version?
A remake would be interesting and a live version would rake in a lot of money.
I think a live version would seem to heavy for a lot of viewers.
Yeah, there is a lot of violence in that movie, maybe too much for a Disney live film.
Disney will probably need to take a few graphic scenes out.
Yes, or the make the movie suited for people 13 and up.
Most Disney films have some violence but it's not graphic.
True, the films have cartoon violence and it looks cute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, are you a fan of the Pixar Disney movies?
Yes, I love them! They are so emotional.
Yeah some of them have such tear-jerking moments. It's quite emotional for a kids movie.
I saw "Inside Out" recently and I was bawling my eyes out.
Were you crying at the part with the imaginary friend, Bing Bong?
Oh, don't even bring that up. You are going to make me cry right now!
I teared up at that part. The more emotional part was when Riley came home from running away.
It's such a powerful movie.
Yes, I really hope they make a sequel.
That would be great. The teaser about puberty at the end was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
Lion king, it was the first movie that made me cry.
Same with me, Bambi made me cry too when his mom died.
I think realistic stories like that are important for children.
I agree, I don't like the princess stories because they are unrealistic.
I know right? If Cinderella's shoe was the perfect fit then why did it fall off?
Not only that but I don't want my daughter to believe in the knight in shining armor narrative.
I agree that narrative is bad for little girls perception of relationships.
You can't go wrong with a Pixar animation though.
Yes Pixar Disney movies have great messages in them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie "Beauty and the Beast"?
Yes.  I saw it years ago when it came out as animation.
I really liked it.  I thought it was a beautiful love story.
I actually thought it was pretty great as well.  Could you believe the voice of the Beast was Robbie Benson?
I was surprised when I found that out.  I remember pictures of him on Tiger Beat magazine when he was a teenager.
He did a great job though.  I guess you never know.
Have you seen the version that just came out with live people?
I haven't seen it yet.  I heard it was pretty good though.
I wonder how they did some of the scenes with real people.
I think I will see it, but I will probably wait until it comes out on Netflix or Direct TV.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I'm not sure, maybe Cinderella.
That's an old one.  Why that one?
I don't know, maybe because it's a traditional story.
Have you been to Cinderella's Castle at Disney World?
Yep, I have pictures of the kids there.
What's the wicked stepmother's name again?
It's Lady Tremaine I think.  And the cat's name is Lucifer.
Hah, that's fitting I guess.
Yeah, and the evil stepsisters are Anastasia and Drizella.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You think they'll remake The Little Mermaid?
Their remaking everything else!
How could they do that live action though?
CGI.
Uhg...
They did a pretty good job on the Jungle Book.
Yeah, maybe they can pull it off.
I wonder who'd they get for Ariel?
Amy Shumer?
Oh no!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My daughter just loves the High School Musical movies.
They were pretty good.
I saw the three of them.
I only saw the first two.
Those kids in the movie are talented.
Yes, but how many high schools have that many good singers?
That's funny.
Funny but true.
Zack Effron pretty much got his start in that movie.
Yes, that was when he became popular.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was just thinking about The Lion King today.
Oh yeah? What inspired that?
I overheard a conversation about the soundtrack earlier.
It does have some great songs! And some great catch phrases.
Wasn't one of the songs a big radio hit?
Yeah, I think so. Some famous singer made it super popular.
And it's such a sad movie, but Simba succeeds.
He does. Even despite the untimely death of Mufasa.
And the challenges presented by Scar.
At least he has Nala by his side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which villain do you like more-Maleficent or Ja'Far?
Hmm that is a hard one.
I know because they both are so devious and ruthless.
Maleficent is evil incarnate but as a fairie as were Ja'Far is evil as a Genie or Jin.
I think that Maleficent is more protective of what she believes to be hers...
But Ja'Far just wants pure raw power.
I think Maleficent's powers are drawn from emotions of fear and jealousy.
And Ja'Far draws his dark magic from anger and vengence.
I like Maleficent more.
I think I like Ja'Far more. What does that say about us?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched National Treasure the other night.
Why?
My daughter never saw the movie. It's pretty good.
Weird that Nick Cage is in it.
He's a goofy actor. It was sort of an action type movie.
Yes, I guess so.
Well maybe more of an adventure.
Thats pretty old isn't it?
Yes from 2004 I think.
Well considering Disney did it, I guess it couldn't have been boring for her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
No, I haven't but heard it was great.
Yes, and the movie received some great reviews.
I heard it won many awards too, especially overseas.
Didn't the Harry Potter character played as Belle in Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, I believe her name is Emma Watson.
She was great and I didn't knew she could sing.
Emma Watson had a great voice in the movie.  She sounded so pure.
Who played her father and the Beast?
I think Dan Evans played the Beast and Kevin Klein played her father.  Both were great as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I know you know a lot about Disney movies.
Indeed.
What was the first Disney movie ever made?
Well, the first animated feature film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
And when was that one made?
1937!
Wow, that's eighty years ago.
Yes, Disney has been making movies for eighty years and they aren't showing any signs of slowing down.
Do you think they've kept the quality up.
Yes, their movies have been consistently good for the past eighty years. While I've only lived twenty-five years, I've had the good fortune of getting to watch many a Disney movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Cars 3 movie?
Yes, I saw it last weekend.  It was Awesome!
I know, I loved it too!
Cruz Ramirez is my new favorite character.
I like Cruz too, but Lightning McQueen is still my favorite!
The demolition derby scene was the best part of the movie.
I agree, I could watch that scene over and over.
Which Disney Cars movie is your favorite?
Well I liked Cars 3 better than Cars 2, but in my opinion, the first Cars movie is the best one of all.
Yes, me too!  Nothing compares to the first Disney Cars movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Moana for the first time finally.
Did you like it? I love the music!
Yes, so much that I also just downloaded the soundtrack.
I think Lin-Manuel Miranda did an amazing job on his work with the music.
Yes, I really like "How Far I'll Go," but I enjoy every song on there.
I like the first song that Moana's father sings to her about the village.
The song with the crab guy is pretty strange, but I still like it.
I find it quite hilarious. The song seems inspired by David Bowie.
And The Rock singing "You're Welcome". I never knew he could sing!
Yes, he does a pretty good job at it, especially the rapping part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Aren't you a great fan of Chris Hemsworth?
Yes and so are you!
Well, good news for us. His new movie Thor: Ragnarok releases in October 2017.
That's great. In time for your autumn break.
You haven't heard it all. From what I read, he is sharing screenspace with Hulk.
I'm not much of a fan of Hulk.
I don't mind him, but Thor is Thor!
True that. I cannot wait for October and the movie to be released in movie halls.
Can you put a reminder in your calendar to book tickets for the movie?
Consider it done. There is still time for the release and I'm getting all excited right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've got a question for you.  It's about Disney.
You have my undivided attention now.  What's your question?
What is the best Disney movie?
That is an extremely tough question, but I'll have to go with 'Beauty and the Beast.'
That's an excellent choice.  What aspect do you like the best?
Honestly, I like every aspect of it.  The writing was near flawless and the music is memorable.
There is something just beautiful about that whole soundtrack.  Did you watch the live-action version?
I saw it on opening night.
What was your opinion on it?
Well, I liked it a lot.  But it was pretty much, beat-for-beat, the exact same as the original.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie Freaky Friday?
Which one?
With Lindsay Lohan
Oh yeah I saw it, it was good.
Did you know that Lohan didnt want that role?
No I dont think thats true
Well Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job.
She is a good actress to be honest.
She seemed a bit out of place for that.
It was a funny cute family film
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Disney movies so much!
Me too.
They make me feel like I'm a kid again.
They make me really happy too! My favorite is Lady and the Tramp.
Aw! That one is so cute! I haven't seen that one in a long time. Lady is so beautiful.
I love the spaghetti eating scene!
I  just think talking animals are adorable.
That's true.
I also love Snow White because of Snow White's singing voice. It's so cute!
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Little Mermaid?
It was pretty crazy
I liked Flounder and Sebastian
They carried the movie
Ariel had lots of gadgets
She couldn't stay out of trouble
I'm glad she finally got feet
Having a big flipper for a tail would sure help in swimming
It would be expensive to keep out predators
You would need plenty of lights, which might attract all kinds of critters
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I think Beauty and The Beast.
Really, that is a hard one for me to decide.
Don't you have a favorite?
I loved Alladin.
I forgot about that one. He was a street rat.
Yes and Robin Williams was a great Genie.
Even the parrot was good.
I don't know who played the parrot.
He's a comedian, I don't know his name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the really old Disney version of A Christmas Tale?
No, I'm sure I didn't. What was it like?
Well it was essentially just an update of the Dickens story, except with Disney characters.
Ah, let me guess, Scrooge was Scrooge McDuck?
Obviously. And Mickey was Bob Cratchit.
Was that were Scrooge McDuck originated?
I have to assume so. The character is clearly a great fan of money.
Well he had to come from somewhere. And Duck Tales was just terrific.
Yeah, he was my favourite Disney character growing up.
Mine too. I so wanted to be one of those kids.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I like Pocahontas.
That is a good movie.  I love the songs in that one.
I do too. But I like that there is a message in the movie.
What is the message?
You know, be kind to the earth.
I guess I didn't figure that out when I saw the movie.
Yes remember the song Colors of the Wind?
Yes I love that song!
The song is about being kind to the earth and love!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is objectively the best Disney movie, Beauty and the Beast or Mary Poppins?
...Oooooh, we're going to be here a while.
Well one got terrible sequels and a useless remake, while the other's getting a needless sequel that may or may not be terrible.
Hey, Lin-Manuel's doing the music, I'm cautiously optimistic.
That is fair.
Also I'm against judging based on supplementary materials, let's just look at these as stand-alones.
Okay, what are some negatives about these two, since I couldn't find any.
Uh...you could interpret Beauty as being about Stockholm Syndrome and it's better as is without Human Again, whereas Mary Poppins has Dick Van Dyke's bad cockney accent.
...I'm thinking Beauty and the Beast wins, though I could also be saying that because I have a bias in favor of animation.
Yeah, I think Mary Poppins might be objectively better. I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I would have to say The Little Mermaid for a lot of reasons.
What makes it your favorite?
The storyline, the animation, the songs, Ariel's character. Everything about it was wonderful.
My favorite is Aladdin. I loved the songs in that one and the genie.
Oh Robin Williams did a great job playing the genie. Iconic character.
I think Disney did Jumanji didn't they? That's another one Robin Williams was good in.
I heard they're supposed to be coming out with another one this year.
Wow Disney is on a roll. It's been a great year for them.
I still need to see Moana though. I've been hearing it was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you a fan of the Hunchback of Notre Dame?
I thought it was great as a kid, but I watched it recently and not so much.
I did too, Esmeralda was my secret crush.
She was prety cute for a cartoon, I just wish she was in a better movie.
It was very depressing as a kids movie.
It was like a history documentary versus an adventure of wonder.
Usually Disney films hold up over the years.
Well this is not one of those.
Especially after that second one.
Yeah they should have stopped when they could.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I keep meaning to ask you, what's your favorite Disney movie?
Hands down, got to be Cinderella.
Really?  I love Beauty and the Beast.
In Cinderella I love how the birds get her dressed. Hope I'm remembering that right.
I think you are. I love the music in Beauty and the Beast.
Be our guest! Be our guest!
Have you seen the new version with Emma Watson?
Not yet. I went with my niece to see Moana instead.
Oh, right! That's the one with Wayne "the Rock" Johnson.
It was okay, but Cinderella is still the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Alice in Wonderland is probably my favourite Disney movie.
Why do you like Alice in Wonderland best?
Well, I really enjoy all of the Disney movies, but the thing I like most about them is the music, and the songs in Alice in Wonderland are really beautiful.
I think I know what you mean, they are quite simple songs, but they are very pretty.
What is your favourite song from the movie?
I think I like the song, "All In The Golden Afternoon" best of all.
I like that song best as well. I love how Alice is so tiny, and the flowers singing are giant.
I would love to be like Alice, and shrink to a tiny size, and wander among the beautiful flowers.
In the movie, after the flowers have sung their song, Alice meets the caterpillar.
The caterpillar is very cute, I like his little shoes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey there.
Did you hear they are remaking the Lion King?
Really?
Yep.
I hadn't heard that.
I think it's going to be live action?
Is that right, that sounds weird.
John Faverau is directing it.
Interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw that Emma Watson was in the new Beauty and the Beast.
She hasn't really been in many movies lately.
I wonder if she can sing well for Belle. Belle's character does a lot of singing, doesn't she?
Yes. She has a pretty big musical number near the beginning if I remember correctly. I wonder who is playing Gaston.
Luke Evans is playing Gaston.
Who?
He was the guy that played Bard in The Hobbit series.
Oh, I know him. He's a good actor.
I bet he does well as Gaston.
I'll let you know what I think after I see the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite disney movie of all time?
Frozen
Mine too
My kids and i watch it all the time
Its a great movie for kids
Yes, theres great lessons to be learned
Like you always need your family
Exactly
I love when movies teach my kids that
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need help finding a good DIsney movie
Do you like the ones with princesses or not?
Not really, I have a young son so he's not into that
Oh okay. Try watching Toy Story and see if he likes it
I think he will love it!
If he enjoys it, there's like 3 more to watch!
He will start to think his toys are alive like Woody though
That's normal though, every kid does that!
Be sure to get him some toys that were used in the movie
Good idea! I'll look online for a Woody doll and maybe Buzz too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Frozen?
Only about a million times!
Huge fan, huh?
No. I have daughters.
Oh, yeah.
I can't even listen to my favorite Beatles song anymore.
Let it Be?
You got it.
Yeah, that show kind of ruined it for me to.
Hope they don't try to work in Strawberry Fields into a cartoon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really enjoy watching Disney movies.
I really enjoy the newer movies where the women have powerful roles.
Me too. I really enjoy that they do not have to be saved by the men of the movie anymore.
I also enjoy the comical relief from the animals in the movies. They are always helpful or funny.
I like the Disney movies where there is an evil princess or queen.
I also enjoy the characters that are a little mean, it makes the movie more enjoyable.
Disney movies are not too long, and are always well thought out and beautiful.
They are always creative, magical and colorful.
I cannot wait to go to Disney Land someday.
Same here! I just need to save money!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What disney movie has the best setting or location?
Aladdin by far!
Oh great choice, but I'm going to have to disagree
What? What movie could have a better location than that.
I'm going to have to go with Lilo and Stitch
Oh, now that I remember, the Hawaii setting was really beautiful
Yeah, and it really went well with the story.
I feel that Aladdins setting worked better though
Yeah, and for the period in the 90s when it came out, it wasn't half bad.
It really spiced up the plot line as well
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that they're making a new Mulan movie?
Yeah, I saw that but they haven't announced all the actors.
I hope they pick a new actress for Mulan.
Agreed, they definitely need a new face for that character.
I heard that they were thinking about getting rid of her character and creating a new male character instead.
I don't like that, I hope they stick with the original storyline.
Agreed, I loved the original characters and I hope they keep the same plot.
That would be so weird if they introduced a new character.
I know, so many of the new Disney movies change around things too much.
I agree, I like when they stay with a traditional storyline.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Freaky Friday was such a a cool movie
it was, I would never want to switch with my mom
I know, can you imagine being a teenager again as an adult
no, I cannot, that spell they cast was crazy
it really was and I think it made them both think
sometimes we forget what it is like to be a certain age
we really do, especially as we get older
I think sometimes it would be good to make a teenager swicth with an adult
It would so that they know what we go through and how easy they have it
I would never be a teen again but it is still better than being an adult !
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Monsters Inc?
I didn't get a chance to watch it all the way through but from what I saw it was good.
I think they came out with a sequel called Monsters University right?
Yeah I think they went off to college in that one.
That's a cute series. My kids are more into the Toy Story franchise.
So am I and I'm an adult. They're really creative and fun movies.
On part 3 when Andy went away to college and played with the toys for the last time I cried my eyes out.
That was really a touching moment. He passed them down to a little girl.
Barbie and Ken were hilarious in that movie.
That's for sure, they took the movie in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So did you see the new Beauty and the Best movie with Emma Watson?
Not yet, but I loved the old animated on.
Yeah me too.
I'm a little bit unsure if I want to see the new one.
Yeah so am I. But I hear the acting and CG is wonderful.
I heard that as well. But live action remake seems a bit iffy to me.
True, but you never know you just might like it.
Yeah, maybe I can give it a chance.
Let's go see it together.
Sounds good to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen A Christmas Carol from Disney?
The CGI version they came out with.
Yes it was so good. I love that story and they did it justice.
Jim Carrey really got into it. I loved the way they got his facial expressions down.
Yes it was a really cute movie. So was Polar Bear Express.
Oh Tom Hanks was wonderful in that.
Aren't they coming out with a part 2?
I think I've heard rumors of it but I'm not really sure. I'm waiting for Incredibles 2.
Oh I'm going to be first in line for that one, me and my kids.
And you know they're going to out do themselves for making us wait so long.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Snow White & the Huntsman?
Yes, I thought it was good.
Charlize Theron did a great job playing the mean queen.
I know, she was great in that movie.
My favorite character had to be the huntsman though.  I love Chris Hemsworth.
Isn't he the guy who played Thor?
Yes, that's him.  And Kristen Stewart plays Snow White.
Isn't she the girl from the vampire movies?
Yes that's here.  There are some good scenes with the Huntsman protecting snow white in the forest.
Yes, I will have to watch that movie again sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Tarzan?
Of course, that movie was a classic.
It was interesting seeing the clash of Tarzan and Jane.
What do you mean by clash?
Well, Tarzan was from the forest while Jane was a normal person.
They do say that opposites attract.
I've seen alot of romantic movies but this one was special.
I always watch Tarzan every now and then.
The Jungle theme was so well put out.
It really added a mystique to the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
The Little Mermaid.
Really?
Yes, I had a friend who was obsessed with it when we were in the third grade, and it rubbed off on me.
I like Aladdin myself. I thought it had the catchiest songs.
All the animated movies from that time period were great. They don't call it the Disney Renaissance for nothing.
That's true.
What did you think of the Rescuers Down Under?
That was a pretty good one, but unfortunately forgotten a bit since it came between Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.
I agree with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pinocchio might be the worst Disney film ever.
Heavens no.
I'll give it credit for being iconic, but the actual movie is dumb.
It's a classic with a classic message.
A message?  And what is that?
That anyone can be anything in life if they have the will and drive.
Even animated wooden boys?
Even animated wooden boys.
Oh, and watch out for strange men who will turn you into donkeys.
Well, you got me there in terms of what the message was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
disney movies aren't just for kids, right?
not at all!
i thought so. they put a lot of hidden adult jokes
yeah, they're family movies. for the whole audience!
you have to keep mom and dad interested, right?
yeah, and the teenage siblings. otherwise the whole family won't go to the movie and you'll lose money
so i don't need to feel weird because zootopia is my new favorite movie?
not at all! it has a great message for all ages
secret of life pets was a huge let down, though
yeah...it really was
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the direction Disney is heading in terms of movies?
Yes, I feel like Disney movies have only gotten better as the years progressed. I am optimistic about the future.
I like Disney movies from all of its history, however I do like how the girls are portrayed as more strong lately.
I would have to agree with you there.
In what way do you think Disney movies are getting better?
The stories are just so true to life these days. For instance, Moana really struck a chord with me.
That was definitely a departure from classic princess stories.
Yes, and yet it was one of the best movies I've ever seen.
Did you like the music in it? I thought that song "You're Welcome" was hilarious.
Yes, I feel that Moana's soundtrack is in the top 5 of Disney soundtracks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Didn't you used to love Cinderella?
Yes, I still do. She is my favorite Disney princess.
Her dress is the prettiest, I think.
Even though the pink dress was pretty, the one the Fairy Godmother made ended up being beautiful.
It was so sad when the step sisters destroyed the pink dress, though.
I know, the mice and birds had worked so hard to make it special for Cinderella.
I think that Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters. They were so cute.
And they loved Cinderella very much. They really tried to look out for her!
Yeah, even though her step-family was so mean to her, she did have good friends in the animals.
And she was lucky to have such a good fairy godmother!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite classic Disney movie?
You mean like old school, like Alice in Wonderland?
Yeah, I actually tried to watch the original of that movie, it was really odd.
Did you see the remake of it with Johnny Depp?
Yeah, I did, I thought that version was odd too.
Me too.  I guess one of my favorites was Mary Poppins.
Oh I did really like that movie.
I liked the movie as a kid and still like watching it today.
For sure, and the songs can really get stuck in your head.
Yeah, I find myself humming "just a spoonful of sugar" quite a bit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
The Little Mermaid!
Very old Disney movie
Yea, but It's so good!
Why?
I like Ursulla
She's horrible!
Haha!  Everyone says that!
Well maybe that's becasue she IS!
Nooo she's awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
My favorite is Snow White
Why is that your favorite?
I like the dwarves. They are really funny.
Did you see it in the theater?
No, I that was before my time.
Do you like any other Disney movies?
I also like Toy Story and Lion King.
I liked Lion King. But I felt like Simba should have stuck with his pride.
Yeah, he wasted his whole teenage life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Disney movie growing up?
I was really into The Little Mermaid. I thought Ariel was really cool.
I did too. I loved that she was strong willed and wanted to see the world on land.
Ursula the sea witch always made me nervous though.
I would always gets scared she was going to keep Ariel's voice even though I knew better.
Ha, well she didn't play fair. I would get so mad every time I watched it when she would change into a beautiful woman to charm the Prince.
Me too, but the worst was when she actually hypnotized him.
Exactly, she was quite the villain.
I loved Ariel's friends Flounder and Sebastian.
They were so cute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the previews for the new Car's movie coming out?
I have!  It looks awesome.
I am going to take Brady there when it comes to theatres so he can see it.
I think I will take my kids as well.
It is suppose to be a great kid friendly movie.
I hope Dusty is in it, my son thinks he is awesome.
Is that the yellow airplane?
Yes, dusty is the airplane.
I hope the movie lasts longer than 90 minutes this time.
It is 112 minutes in length so it is a bit longer than the older ones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Every time I eat stick pretzels, it makes me think about The Great Mouse Detective.
The disney film? How come?
Well, it came out when I was little and I remember a friend and I watched it and pretended that the pretzels were pipes like Basil had.
Oh dear, that wouldn't fly these days!
I suppose not, but I always loved that movie. The end was so intense!
The part where Ratigan went all rabid, you mean?
Yes, and Basil and him fell off the clock tower.
I was so scared he'd actually died as a kid!
Basil was my absolute favourite character growing up; I loved how smart he was.
Yes, though watching it now I have to laugh at how silly some of the lines are!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the Lion King came out the year I was born in 1994?
No, I did not know that. Did you here they are making a live action remake of it?
Yes, and I am not sure how I feel about that. It was always one of my favorite Disney shows.
I always liked Timon and Pumbaa. They were so funny.
I must have sang Hakuna Matata so much, it drove my parents crazy.
That was my favorite song of the whole show. I was always sad though when Mufasa died.
I could not believe his own brother, Scar, killed him.
Then poor Simba thought he was the one that killed his father.
Yes, but if not for that, he would never have met up with Timon and Pumbaa.
They do make the whole show so funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what year the movie "Pinocchio" came out?
If i'm not mistaken, I believe it came out in 1940. That's a very old movie but it's so influential.
Ya, what was it about? Can you give me a quick summary?
Sure. It's about a puppet who is turned into a real life person but first must prove himself worthy to become a real boy.
Do you know what his father or creators name was? I think i'm starting to remember it.
His father's name was Geppetto. He wanted a boy so bad that he wood carved one.
Oh ok. I'm know about it now. There was a Blue Fairy who appointed Jiminy Cricket to be his "conscience".
Yep. that's right and every time Pinocchio lied, his nose would grow. It was hilarious.
I glad that Pinocchio finally became a boy at the end.
That just goes to show you that being honest pays off.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana yet?
Yeah it just came out on Netflix.
Its a great movie.
Yeah the grandma was the coolest.
I love that Disney is starting to add so much culture to their movies.
And woman empowerment.
I heard they actually went to a village in Hawaii to do research for the movie.
Thats great.
It woukd be so great to be so in tune with nature
I love how much they respect the water.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that I haven't seen Lion KIng in years
Really? Me too! We should really watch that one of these nights.
Yeah, maybe watch Aladdin too.
Good choice, man, Disney had a lot of good movies in the 90s
I know! They just couldn't miss for the longest time.
Even the direct to video sequels were pretty good. They could have made a lot of money if they released them in theaters.
Toy Story was the only exception, that series made a lot of money.
I wonder if they're going to make a new Toy Story.
I'd think so, it's still pretty popular.
Yeah, maybe they'll make a new Toy Story once Frozen's run it's course.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that there is a new Dumbo movie coming out?
I didnt know, I think thats great I loved that little rascal.
Yeah I think its great as well.
Do you know when its coming out?
Im not sure but Ive heard is coming next year, I really want to see it.
Me too, I liked the old version very much.
Yeah it was pretty cool it was a great movie from my childhood.
Do you know who the villain is going to be?
Im not entirely sure but I know that Michael Keaton was cast for the role.
I think Disney is doing a great job reviving clasic movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what my favorite Disney animated film is?
No. But I know it has to be a kids film because you always take your grandkids.
You are right!  It was Rapunzel.
That is a go.od one. I love how Rapunzel falls in love with Flynn
Me too! The mother was so mean.
Well,she turned out not to be her mother afterall.
That is true. Rapunzel was really the daughter of a king and queen.
Yes she was. She sure had some adventures though trying to see the lanterns.
She did, and she finally did get to see them.
Yes, it was on her birthday.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?
Which one, aren't there more than one of them?
The latest one, it just came out on DVD I think.
Is it animated? or does it have real actors in it.
It has real actors, Emma Watson plays Belle.
I wonder who plays the Beast?
The Beast is played by Dan Stevens.
Where are you finding this information about the movie?
I went to Disney's Beauty and the Beast website, they have a lot of great interaction type activities.
I think I will go now and check that out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite character in Finding Nemo is Mr. Ray.
He is awesome. I like how they made him the teacher.
That is why I like him so much. His wings make him a natural protector for the little ones.
My favorite part is in Finding Dory, when Dory insists that Mr. Ray wants her to be the assistant.
I liked it when Mr. Ray was teaching them about migration, and Dory kept echoing him.
It was so cute when the one asked Dory where did she grow up.
Especially when she went off tangent to tell them what happened when mommies and daddies got together.
That was one lesson Mr. Ray was quick to interrupt.
Everything comes back to the undertow.
It plays such an important part in both Finding Nemo and Finding Dory.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch Captain America Civil War?
I did watch it, I was wating for that movie a long time.
I was looking forward to it as well, I was really exited.
Did you have a favorite team?
I like Iron Man so Iguess I was supporting him, wha about you?
I was rooting for Iron Man as well, I just love Robert Downy Jr, I think hes a great actor.
What other character did you like in the movie?
I also liked Vision, I think hes really cool what about you?
Well I liked Black Widow, she just has great moves and shes pretty hot as well.
Yeah I know she is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What movies do your kids watch?
Oh my kids love Disney movies!
What are their favorite movies ?
The younger one loves Frozen and the elder one loves tangled .
Isn't frozen the one with the song? Let it go?
My God! my kids played that song on repeat for hours!
Haha , I can understand your pain, do you watch disney movies ?
Yes I have to see the whole movie with them , they wont watch it without me.
Haha it's adorable!
Maybe for you , I have watched frozen at least 10 times .
XXXXXXXXXXX
WHy is there a cars 3?
I know, right?
cars 2 was not very interesting.
It also got a lot of bad reviews.
most people did not like it.
i dont know ANYONE who liked it.
They should just do a wall-e too then.
wall e was great
i agree with you on that.
cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
The story of Sleeping Beauty is wonderful. Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip make quite the duo.
They do make quite the handsome couple.
Who is your favorite Disney Princess?
I really like Cinderella. Prince Charming is striking, as well.
Why do you like Cinderella?
I like that she works hard and does not complain. She is pure and gets the prince in the end.
More like the prince gets her, looking for the foot that fit the slipper.
It could be viewed that way. I love her dress in the ball scene where she loses that slipper.
It helps when you have a Fairy Godmother to dress for for a ball.
I wish I had a Fairy Godmother and a Prince Charming in my life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they will make another Toy Story movie?
I don't know, we should look it up.
There were three made so far right?
Yes.
It's amazing how far the animation has come since the first one.
Yes it is a really big difference.
Ah, I see here that a new one is being made.
Oh, that is awesome. When is it coming out?
In 2019.
Great, but that's so far away!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Beauty and the Beast film with Emma Watson?
Yes, I saw it in theaters. It's out on DVD now.
I don't think Emma Watson was the best actress to play Belle.
She was a bit meek in the role, but it is a hard role to fill.
Dan Stevens was phenomenal as the beast. Great actor.
I agree. He did a great job with the role, even though he was a computer graphic character for most of the movie.
Most of the film had to be. I guess that is the hardest part about making an animated movie live-action.
With all the talking objects like Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts, it is a wonder they even attempted to film it. Technology today made it possible.
I wonder what Disney movie they will attempt to film next.
I hope they film Sleeping Beauty. That film is one of my favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite live action Disney movie?
That would have too be Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
I've never seen that one, but it sound like a animated film.
No, it's an fusion of animation and life action.
Okay, tell me about it.
Its set in a world where cartoon characters live side by side with real, live people.
Okay, so I take it the character Roger Rabbit is framed?
Yes, for murder and Eddy Valiant(Bob Hoskins) end up having to help him prove his innocence and save his life.
So cartoon characters can die in this world?
Yes, but only by being immersed or sprayed with a mixture of acidtone, turpentine, and benezene called The Dip.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana?
No, I haven't.  Is it any good?
Yes, I love it!  The soundtrack is awesome.
What's your favorite song?
"You're Welcome," the character Maui sings it, and he's voiced by The Rock!
Oh, I've heard that song!  I didn't know it was The Rock.
Yup, he's actually a really great singer, and his character is funny.
Didn't the guy from Hamilton write some of the music?
Lin-Manuel Miranda, he did the music and lyrics for a bunch of the songs.
It sounds awesome, I'll have to check it out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie Moana?
No, not yet.  What's it about?
It's about a girl who keeps finding herself drawn to the ocean.  She goes on a quest to find a demigod named Maui.
Maui?  Like the Hawaiian island?
Yes, exactly.  He is a shapeshifter who stole the heart of Tafiti.
Who is Tafiti?
She's almost like the Hawaiian version of Mother Nature.
Why did he steal her heart?
He wanted to give it to the people, but it backfired.  Stealing her heart started to make nature die.
Sounds cool.  Maybe I'll watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of Disney movies do you like?
I grew up on their animated films. I saw all their live action movies in the 60s too, but those are pretty corny now.
I like the direction they went with their more action oriented live action, like Pirates of the Caribbean.
That first Pirates movie was such a pleasant surprise! I thought it would be awful, but I think it's marvelous.
Johnny Depp, he is amazing.
He's just one of the terrific elements of that movie. I love the music and the production values too.
The rest of the Pirates movies were not as good, I don't think.
The second one was okay, but yea, then the series kind of went off the rails.
Have you seen the latest one?
Not yet, but I'll give it a chance when it comes out on DVD.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know I watched it, but I don't remember the movie Dumbo.
I really don't either.
I had to be a kid when I saw it.
Me too. Do any of your kids have the DVD?
Actually, no.
We should see if they still sell it.
I would really like to watch it.
Does Dumbo's mom get taken away or killed?
I really don't know.
We've got to find it so we can watch it as adults.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read that The Incredibles 2 is supposed to come out next year!
Really? How old do you think Dash and Violet will be in the movie?
Probably the same age, would be a big risk having them be older.
Do you think Jack Jack will finally use his powers in front of his family?
I really hope so, especially after watching Jack Jack attack.
Because I liked the first Incredibles so much I'm a bit scared to watch the second one.
It could be like finding Dory; interesting but not nearly as good.
Yeah, hopefully nothing like Cars 2, which was terrible.
Agreed, Cars 2 was nowhere near as good as Cars 1.
I suppose we will have to wait and see how good the new movie is then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard that Disney is doing a remake of Mulan?
Yes, but I can't believe that they're not including any songs!
I know! What is Mulan with "Reflection" or "Honor to Us All"?
And don't forget "I'll Make a Man Out of You" by Donny Osmond!
Oh, yeah, that one's fun to sing along with.
I also heard that they are removing the love interest with Shang.
Like, they won't even have his character?
I'm not sure, but I think that's what I heard.
Wow, that's crazy. Will this even be the same story line? What about Mushu?
I haven't heard about that. Hopefully they keep him!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Disney's 101 Dalmations real version the other night.
That was done pretty good.
Yes, but I think the cartoons are better.
Me too.
There are probably real people out there who would do that with dogs.
Do you mean use their fur?
Yes, there's a lot of crazy people in the world.
What was the evil womans name?
Cruella De-Vil.
That's right. She was a wicked woman.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just sat through Toy Story with my nephew and boy do I miss the old Disney movies.
I agree the old Disney movies were great, they just seemed to have more heart.
Which Disney movie do you remember the most from your childhood?
I would have to say Old Yeller, you know that movie about the boy and his dog.
I agree that was the best.  I didn't have a dog when I was kid but when I saw the little boy Travis with his dog Old Yeller, that made me beg for one!
Wasn't that also the movie with Fess Parker as the father Jim?  He used to be in so many Disney films, he was like a father figure back then.
Of course the thing everyone remembers is the part where Old Yeller gets rabies and they have to shoot him.
I cried like a baby at the end of that movie.  It seemed so cruel after the dog had saved the boy from the bear earlier in the movie.
I'm not sure but I think the little boy in that movie was Kevin Corcoran, I remember I thought he was so cute.
Really makes me sad to think how old we all are now, that movie came out in 1957!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was reading an article online the other day about the new Disney movie Star Wars Episode 8 that's coming out at the end of this year.
It's amazing how popular Star Wars is. It's one of those franchise movies that seems like it will never end.
People will probably be really nostalgic about it since Carrie Fisher died this year.
I think people will always think of her as Princess Leia.
I was thinking about how it was kind of depressing when I read about the new movie.
Star Wars is depressing?
I saw the very first Star Wars when it came out in 1977 at a drive-in movie theatre.
Wow, that was 40 years ago, and drive-ins are practically extinct.
I know, and Carrie Fisher was only four years older than me and now she's gone.
I can see why the movie might make you kind of depressed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the deal with the Frozen movie stuff?
What do you mean?
My two little girls are going crazy for everything Frozen.
That's pretty normal, what's the problem?
I've never seen the movie. I don't understand why they have to have everything Frozen.
You should really see the movie. It's great.
Why?
It's hard to explain. They just did everything right, and the movie became extremely popular. I mean, it's popular for a reason.
Maybe, I will. Then I'll understand why my girls need their entire room to have Elsa and Anna everywhere.
That's funny. Good luck with all of that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Robin Williams is one of my all time favorite actors.
He was a big part of my childhood but I think I remember him best as Genie from Aladdin.
Yes Genie was the best! You know Al really never did have a friend like him.
I see what you did there. Very clever.
Jasmine and Aladdin honestly were very lucky to have someone like Genie in their lives.
I'd second that and add Abu to the list.
Yeah Abu had a good heart, but what about Magic Carpet?
Man, if I could just have a flying magic carpet that would make me so happy!
If I could just have Genie that would make ME so happy!
Would you try to break the rules about wishing for more wishes of would you turn into a power hungry Jafar??
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you remember Toy Story?
I love that movie! My favorite character is Woody! "Buzz, you're just a toy!"
I laughed so hard during the scene where all the toys confront Sid.
Yeah, that was pretty funny. Kinda spooks me out thinking about my own toys though.
Did you see Toy Story 3?
Yeah! I loved how it was based around Andy going to college, I could relate.
The Toy Story movies sure have followed us throughout our lives.
Lotso-Huggin bear was pretty conniving, but his story was sad. I could see why he was so cold-hearted.
Yeah, and the scene at the end of the movie where the toys get rescued by their fellow toys was incredibly heartwarming.
The whole Toy Story series was pretty much perfect.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Pollyanna last night.
The old Disney movie?  I saw it as a kid.  When was it released?
1960.
Who was in it?
Hayley Mills from Te Parent Trap.
Cool.  Who else was in it?
Jane Wyman and Karl Malden.
Who directed it?
Philip Kaufman.
It was a fun movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
TV is playing 'Tarzan' movie. Want to watch it?
Want to revisit the childhood?
You will find it surprising but I haven't watched the movie.
Seriously, how did you even manage that?
I know. Even I find it hard to believe. What is the best thing about the movie?
The animation was pretty advanced for that age. I loved the way they portrayed the chemistry of Tarzen-Jane.
It's kind of embarrassing that I haven't watched it till now. How many oscars it won?
I guess they won an oscars for Best Music, Original Song.
Oh! Who gave the voice for adult Tarzan?
Sorry friend, I don't know much about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally watched The Lion King with my kids.
Oh that's a great movie to watch with kids. I loved the music.
Ya they really liked I just can't wait to be kind. Isaac asked to hear it again after the movie.
I still like Simba and Nala singing Can you Feel the love tonight.
Ya, that's a part I liked more as i'm older but I don't think they liked it.
They also thought Timon and Pumba were funny. Isaac laughed when they were first there scaring away the voltures.
I remember as a kid really liked the part where Simba fights Scar.
Oh ya that's good too. Isaac kept calling him Scarf. I thought that was funny.
Cute! I actually have the CD would they want to borrow that?
I bet they would love to hear all the songs again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally watched Fantasia
Dude where have you been?  That movie is so old.
I never really knew about it.
Why not?  Did you live under a rock as a kid?
No We just weren't really into Disney back then.  I did think it was cool to see Micky Mouse as the sorcerer.
Yeah that was pretty cool.  I like the ballerina hippos.
Didn't it have like a trippy vibe to it though?
Yeah like you Alice in Wonderland type vibe you mean?
Yes just like that.  Just weird things that don't happen normally.
I think it was because they were trying to give sound a visual.  I think the music was written first then they drew the movie to fit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love cats. What movies should I watch?
You need to watch The Aristocrats! A great musical starring cats and kittens!
Wow! Who are the main characters?
A mother and her three kittens--they have to go on the run from their home in Paris.
Oh no!
Luckily, the encounter a street-wise tom-cat who helps them out.
When is the movie set?
I think its the 40s or the 50s.
Are there any other animals in the movie?
Oh yeah--there are geese and horses!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just introduced my kids to Homeward Bound.
What a wonderful kids show.
I really enjoyed it growing up.
Michael J. Fox relly did it for me.
Sally Fields wasn't bad either.
Who was she?
The cat.
Oh, yeah. Pretty funny stuff.
The kids loved it.
How could they not!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about The Little Mermaid?
I love that movie!
What do you like most about it?
Probably the music, every song is SO good.
What's your favorite song in that movie?
That's a really hard question, but probably "Under the Sea"
That song is so much fun, it's hard to not just get up and dance and sing along!
Exactly! Do you have a favorite song?
Still a hard questions, but maybe "Part of your World"
That's a great one too, you really feel Ariel's longing to be human.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Little Mermaid?
Yes, it is one of my favorite movies. I really like ariel.
She is so pretty! I wish I had hair like hers.
It is so long and red, it is pretty great.
I also like Open season!
That is a great one, perfect story about friendship.
I could watch it over and over.
It did have a great story line.
I hope they make a new one in the near future.
I would really be excited about seeing that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Alice in Wonderland?
The one with Johnny Depp?
No, the Disney animation.
I have not seen that in a long time.
It was one of the first sort of book into a cartoon.
I thought all Disney movies were based on books and old fairy tales.
The first sort of more contemporary one.
I guess the book was not that old when the film was made.
Walt Disney loved the idea of turning those dark fairy tales into light movies.
Yeah, but some like Bambi are not all that light. When his mom is shot!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Mickey or a symbol of Mickey is hidden in most all of Disney's films?
No I did not. Can you give me and example?
In Snow white when Dopey is on the floor surrounded by bubbles, the bubbles on the right side make and outline of Mickey's head and ears. The traditional Mickey symbol everyone recognises.
I never paid attention to that.
In Cinderella when she is scrubbing the floor the bubbles again make Mickey's head. And in the Loin King the symbol is on a bugs shell when Timon says that it looks like a good place to rustle up some grub.
On a bugs shell? In bubbles? But these are just symbols.
Yes but in Oliver and Company he is on a watch face and in The Rescuers he is on the clock face at the meeting.
I guess those are traditional symbols too since watches and clocks are great Mickey merchandising tools.
He is full size too as he appears in the crowd in both The Little Mermaid and The Goofy Movie.
It is like a game trying to find the hidden Mickeys!
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched Brave the other night with the kids.
Oh, I love that movie!  What was your favorite part?
I loved when Merida shot all the targets that her "suitors" shot, and did better than them.
Yeah, that was so great.  I love seeing strong girl characters in movies.
Oh, and when she climbed to the top of the mountain, that was fantastic!
I know, right?  Do you think they'll make a sequel?
I don't know, it's been what, five years?  If they were going to, they'd probably have announced it by now.
Yeah, you're probably right.  It's too bad, the movie was a lot of fun.
Yeah, like the triplet brothers becoming bear cubs?
They were hilarious!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the classic Disney Cinderella?
Yeah, I used to watch it all the time as a kid.
Me too. It was one of my favorites until recently.
What do you mean?
Well, I watched it again a few weeks ago, and it dawned on me how many negative messages about women are in that movie.
Wow, I guess you're probably right. I never thought about it.
Neither did I. But the whole point of the movie is that this girl is beautiful and graceful enough for a guy to save her from her life.
Yeah. Like her life wouldn't have been intrinsically valuable had she not been this great beauty.
Exactly. And the only way she could escape her terrible situation was to make a wish for someone else to save her.
We've really come a long way in a short time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you checked out 'Thor' movies?
I watched the first one.
Do you know Thor: Ragnarok is releasing around November 2017?
Well, something to look forward to before Xmas.
Whenever I think Thor, I'm reminded of Chris Hemsworth.
Same here, feels like he was especially made for Thor.
I love his hammer, wonder how much must it weigh.
I think it must be light weight in reality.
How funny must it be then for him to act as if it is really heavy?
That's why they are actors, they can act.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss the old Disney movies...
Like Fantasia?
YES!!!  Such a classic....
You always loved that movie. I thought those brooms were creepy....
WHAT!?!  Olaf is creepy if you ask me....
How dare you!  Olaf is the cutest!
You love Frozen so much - you've turned your back on the original movies....
No. I love them all...
...wanna watch The little mermaid again?
YES,,,
XXXXXXXXXXX
We are going to watch the Disney movie Holes tonight.
Really? I heard that was a great movie.
We heard that too.
My son watched it years ago and loved it.
That was out about ten or twelve years ago wasn't it?
Actually I think it's more like fourteen years.
Well, I know there are a lot of good actors in it.
Yes, I think Sogourney Weaver is in it.
She's a good actress.
Yeah, she's been in a lot of good movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Omg, have you seen the poster for the upcoming movie, Cars 3?
No i haven't
You should totally do it, i think they're making a twist in the story.
Oh really? I hope that doesn't involve taking off to any of the original characters...
Well, i guess we will have to find out.
That's sounds like a plan, what are you up to this afternoon?
Um, not much, why?
We should go to the premier this night.
Oh i would love to, i really loved the last one.
Me too, then it's a date. I will pick you up at 10:00pm
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Little Mermaid?
Of course, that's one of my favorites!
Who's your favorite character?
I would have to say Sebastian.
Really? Why?
I could listen to him talk all day.
Don't forget listening to him sing "Kiss the Girl".
I used to drive my mom crazy singing it.  Whose your favorite character?
Definitely Ariel. There's just something about a mermaid princess.
That's very true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie.
I think I like the ones from when I was a kid the best.
Oh the older ones, like Snow White and Cinderella?
No, I'm not that old!  I'm talking about Finding Nemo and The Little Mermaid.
Oh yeah, from that time frame I think I like Beauty and the Beast the best.
My favorite was probably Aladdin, although I liked a bunch of them.
What makes Aladdin your favorite?
I really liked the music a lot, and thought it would be fun to fly on a magic carpet.
I liked the Genie the best, his scenes were hilarious.
Yeah, Robin Williams did a really great job playing that character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dis you know that Mel Gibson was in Pocahontas?
WHat who was he?
John Smith.
Oh no wonder I thought John Smith was dreamy growing up.
Yea, I had a big crush on him. I loved that movie anyway but now I have to re-watch it.
Yea we should do that some night. It's been too long since I've heard any of the songs.
Oh we should have a singalong with Colors of The Wind.
I love that song! It's such an underrated Disney song.
I know, I didn't think that was possible. Just around the river bend is pretty amazing too.
Oh man now you make me wish I was in a canoe with Meeko.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe that there is going to be a toy story 4 movie.
Oh really?
Yes, Pixar is already working on it.
I can't wait, i loved the last one.
I know, it was awesome, but i don't really like how long these movies take to be released.
I totally agree with you there.
Do you think that we will be seeing the same characters again?
I hope so, it wouldn't be the same without them. I can't imagine a toy story without Woody & Buzz
Well, i guess we will wait a couple of years to find out.
It's going to be all worth it, believe me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get a chance to watch Tarzan?
Is that the Disney movie?
Yes it is.
No I missed it.
You should watch it.
Why is that?
It is really good.
What makes it good?
It is a complete movie, great dialogue and action, even drama and adventure.
Ok that sounds like a good overall movie, thank you for mentioning it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Honey I Shrunk the kids was probably the funniest non animated Disney movie.
Yeah it spawned a series and alot of merch.
I think even Disney World made a ride based on it.
Rick Moranis did a great job as the father.
The way they made the spider huge was scary
It was good technology.
But the premise of the movie hasnt been since in forever
Yeah that kind of original content you mean right
Yeah like they havent written a movie like that
They will just give it time, they love their animate films too
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey did you like mulan?
who is mulan?
You know the disney movie titled that?
Oh yeah i remember now, yeah i liked that movie
it was really good with the deep underlying message
what deep underlying message are you talking about?
The one that women can do things just as good as men
You sure that was the message?
Of course, thats why mulan had to go undercover as a guy
Makes sense, well then yeah what a great message
XXXXXXXXXXX
When I was young my parents always took us to the drive-in movie theater when the Disney movies were playing.
Mine did too. We used to play on the swing set that was there.
We took a blanket and sat on the grass. There were six kids in my family so we could not hear if we were all in the car.
What ones did you go see?  I remember seeing Bambi.
I will never forget seeing Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs. I was so scared of the witch.
I was kind of scared of the Dwarfs.
That is so funny. We also saw Dumbo.
I saw Dumbo too. I saw Pinocchio.
Well come to think of it I was scared of my noise growing when I lied to my parents.
I felt the same way. I suppose that one had a good message for children.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I just read an article in a magazine about a Disney movie that's coming out.
Cool, what's it called.
It's called Gigantic, and you will never guess what it is about.
I think it will be about something really big.
Yeah, it is the Disney story version of Jack and the Beanstalk.
Wow, what a cool idea. When is it coming out?
Well as usual that is a bit fuzzy, the article said next year, but I Googled it and Google says 2020. So who knows.
I hate when they do that. Get us excited and then delay, delay, delay.
Well I looked it up on Wikipedia and it seems it was scheduled for 2018, but they have already pushed it back to 2020.
So we have a gigantic wait for Gigantic then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just downloaded the Mulan soundtrack on my phone and I'm so excited!
Gosh, I haven't heard that music in forever!
Neither had I, until I babysat my neighbor's daughter. We watched the movie and now I can't stop singing it!
The dragon was my favorite, what was his name?
Mushu! He was so funny!
That's the one! "Dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow!"
I'm going on a road trip with my sisters and I thought that the soundtrack would be great for driving music!
It totally would! You guys are gonna be singing your hearts out the whole drive!
My favorite song is "Reflection," even though it's kind of sad. How about you?
I like "I'll make a man out of you!"
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite song was "Let it Go".
My daughter loves that song and sings it all the time.
Do you get tired of hearing her sing it?
No, I like that she enjoys emulating wholesome characters like Elsa and Anna.
My son's favorite Character is Olaf.
I am sure he will play a large role in the upcoming movie.
Do you think you will take your kids to see it in theaters when it comes out?
Definitely, We always go see the new Disney movies.
I will probably wait until it comes out on Netflix.
We love that Netflix carries several of Disney's movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember when the animated Lion King came out.
That was a great movie.
Disney really knows how to do animation right.
Yes, they use top talent because they know having great actors is important even if they are only heard and not seen.
I'd say it's even more important if they are only heard and not seem. A great actor can covney a lot with their voice that a lesser talent cannot.
I can't imagine anyone else but Jeremy Irons in the role of scar.
And what about James Earl Jones as Mufasa? Brilliant.
And Sir Elton John's score?
Oh Lord! I love, love, love those songs!
It's the Circle of Life after all!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you used to watch the Disney Channel original movies? They usually did one each month.
I did and most of them were great. I wish they would put more out on DVD.
Smart House got released.
Really? Any others?
Wish Upon a Star and the original Seventeen Again.
I thought that was originally one of those but it got remade.
It originally had the twins from Sister/Sister.
That's right. I saw it once.
I want the Zenon ones to be released.
I'd buy those for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know it's not technically a 'princess' but my favorite Disney (non) princess is Pocohontas.
I saw that when I lived In Zurich, Switzerland.
Disney is beloved everywhere.
This was a really cool showing. It was in a park in downtown Switzerland and hey showed it outside like a drive in movie.
That must have been fun.
Oh, it was. For a mere 10 Swiss Francs we got to see the movie, were issued a heavy cardboard 'stool' that we all put together ourselves, and a box of popcorn.
That's a lot for 10 francs.
You bet is was. And the funniest thing happened 1/2 way through the movie.
What was that?
The ground was soft from an earlier rain so half way through the movie, one by one people's cardboard stools collapsed and you'd just see heads disappear. It was funny. I fell, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just found my collection of Disney movies at my parents house, do you want me to bring some over for the kids?
Oh, that would be so great! I appreciate it.
Of course, I'm happy to help.  My favorite was the Little Mermaid when I was young, do the kids like mermaids and princesses?
Oh yes, they are definitely in the princess stage. They love Aladdin and Princess Jasmine, if you happen to have a copy of that one too!
I think I have every Disney movie ever made. I even have some of the new ones they might not have yet!
Oh, excellent, thank you so much! They haven't seen Princess and the Frog yet, but they keep talking about it.
I have that one too! i'll add that to the pile, and it was a really good movie for little girls to watch, I think.
Perfect, I love Disney movies but I'm glad their newer ones are more focused on female empowerment.
I agree, the classic movies will always be classic, but they do seem to have more female heroes lately!
Disney is such a classic part of childhood, thanks so much for bringing over those cute musical movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the movie Tarzan?
I think is very heartbreaking.
Why do you say that?
It is very sad that his parents are killed.
I know. I agree. Do you think is realistic?
I think it could happen, it´s sound crazy being raised by monkeys.
What do you think about Jane?
I´m happy she run into Tarzan´s life, that way he is not so sad.
Is there a song in the movie that you like?
Of course, It´s called You'll Be In My Heart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your son going to be for halloween?
He's despicable really! Get it?
No?
He's going to be a Minion from Despicable Me.
I'm not sure I remember them, my son has been watching Cars non-stop lately.
You definitely know, they're the little yellow people with one eye in overalls.
Oh, I remember them! That was a great movie.
They have a Minions movie too, maybe your son would like it!
Anything to get a break from Cars!
You might like having a son better than one of those Minions! wish me luck on Halloween!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched brave last week.
That was a good emotional movie
I didnt like it at first because the girl was being brat
She was, but it had a great ending.
It was so sweet
Definitely a great family movie
Yes it has good lessons for the kids
My kids loved it
So did mine
I wonder if they will come out with another one
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you like disney movies?
I love the magic of them all
So you must like movies with pure magic like Sword and the Stone or Cinderella.
Well not just literal magic, but just the magic of Childhood
What movie are you talking about
Well take peter pan for example.
Oh i love that movie
It uses childhood innocence and wonder to tell us a well known story
I guess that does help them connect to a younger audience
And thats why they remain timeless for so many generations
XXXXXXXXXXX
There's a Disney movie coming out in November I can't wait to see.
What is it?
Thor:Ragnorak with Chris Hemsworth. Apparently a lot of other people like me can't wait to see it.
Why? Are they all posting online or something?
They released a trailer of it, and the people who viewed the trailer in the first 24 hours broke the record for number of views in the first 24 hours for a Disney film.
Wow, people must really want to see it. What movie was the previous record holder?
Beauty and the Beast. It had 127 million views, and Thor had 136 million views.
I didn't think people would be that excited about a trailer for Thor.
It was because a bunch of the Marvel creators were boasting about how this was going to be the best trailer ever, and it got the fans really curious.
I wonder what the box office records will be when the film comes out in November?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Pirates movie?
I would say the first one.
That's too easy. Everybody says that.
Because it's true.
Yeah, but there's got to be another one that's better.
Nope, the first is always the best.  It was more fun than the others.
True.  Some of the plots got a bit silly.
A bit silly?  You couldn't even follow them!
The last movie was a bit easier to understand than some other ones.
By no means easy though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite, newer, Disney movie?
The Princess and the Frog.
I love Tiana's dress when she gets married in the swamp!
I do too. I also love the one where she is in the club that the Shadowman shows her.
It really is a great movie. The ode to the food and Mardi Gras. Especially the gumbo.
That scene where her father comes home, tired and exhausted is one of my favorites. Especially when they invite everyone to join them for gumbo.
That right there is true family values, and shows that no matter how much money you have, family is everything.
That love story of Evangeline and Ray is a tear jerker. Gets me everytime.
Me too. I would watch a Disney short on that.
I would too. And one on Mama Odie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Disney princess would you want to be friends with.
Jasmine, for sure.
Why?
Isn't it obvious? She owns a tiger.
Ok, that's a good point. But Ariel is a mermaid.
Yeah, but I don't want to have to hang out underwater.
Good point.
Plus Jasmine has a palace.
So does Rapunzel from Tangled!
Yeah, but Jasmine has a palace AND a tiger.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Parent Trap?
The original one or the Lindsay Lohan one?
The Lindsay Lohan one. There was another one?
Yeah, it was made in the 60s.
I'd never heard of it before now.
I liked the newer version too, but it was a bit after my time.
I loved the Lindsay Lohan version as a child. Thought she had real potential as an actress.
Yeah, it's a shame her career never went anywhere. She plateaued as a child.
It's still a great kid's movie to this day.
I agree, but most kids today want to watch what's new instead of what's good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you say had the most recognizable voice in Aladdin?
I think Gilbert Gottfried as Iago. There's no mistaking that voice!
I agree. Although Robin Williams is a close second as Genie.
You know, if you consider how much he brought that character to life, you could say he's the most recognizable.
True. The jokes and little nuances of the Genie definitely couldn't have been brought by anyone else.
Yes! Especially when he first comes out of the lamp.
I'd say the best was when he was making Aladdin into a prince.
Pretty much any time he changed into something else was amazing!
I agree. And that shirt he wears when he's finally set free?
Definitely taken right from Robin Williams' wardrobe!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think any disney movies are overrated?
Definetely, quite a few actually.
I think Cinderella is, honestly.
Yes! Thank you.
Yeah, I just feel like it's not THAT good of a story, you know?
Totally, I also don't really like Sleeping Beauty.
Agreed, it's overplayed.
Yes, just like music!
We are particular on Disney movies, aren't we?
Just a tad, but there's a lot to critique.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Princess and the Frog is such a fun movie.
I haven't seen it, but I heard the music is good. Is that true?
The music is definitely awesome. It's a really funny movie too.
What's funny about it?
Well, not to give too much away, but the main characters get turned into frogs.
So it's a twist on the classic fairy tale?
Yeah, I really like how Disney revamped the story.
Does it take place in modern times?
It takes place in the early nineteen hundreds I think.
That sounds like it could be interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Moana?
Yeah, pretty cute.
I didn't even mind The Rock.
You don't like Johnson?
No, terrible actor.
He's only the highest paid actor in Hollywood right now.
A crying shame.
But he was good in Moana.
He's a terrific Demi God.
Your so sarcastic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think that Mulan had some of the best music I've ever heard in a movie.
Which song was your favorite?
The one that goes "I'll make a man out of you..."
That's a funny song. I like how Mulan makes all the guys look like whimps.
Yeah she's an awesome character.
Do you think Mulan was better than Mulan 2?
Oh absolutely.
Yeah. A lot of times the first movie is better than the second.
I don't know why they make sequels of some movies. They need to just leave them alone.
You're right. Like The Lion King; number one was way better than 2.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Mighty Ducks made me want to play hockey
same here! I did play hockey in middle school
what type? was it ice hockey or floor hockey
I played floor hockey, I have also played ice hockey, it is fun
I liked how the team did so well but started out rough
so did I , they really worked hard for what they got
hockey is a rough sport though, lots of injuries
remember that big kid on their team?
Yes, he was in charge of knocking people over
I need to watch that movie again soon !
XXXXXXXXXXX
i think Disney movies have gone down the hill
What are you talking about? They've been expanding into a lot of new areas
Liek what? Doing culturally sensitive politically correct BS is not expanding
Not that, but their works with Pixar has led to some of the greatest animations of all time.
Ah yes, Pixar. But that's such a departure from Disney style animation.
Which says,,, what? That they're expanding They're including more style of animation.
What's the newest from Pixar anyway?
Cars 3. It's in the theaters now.
We should so go see that
It's a date.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Disney movie Freaky Friday?
That was pretty funny.
Did they remake that movie?
I'm not sure.
I remember Lindsey Lohan in it.
Yes, then they did.
Did you see the original one?
No, I saw the new one.
I didn't. Guess it would be just as good.
I'll watch the old one and let you know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know they are remaking Beauty and the Beast with real people?
Yes I saw that. I'm not sure that I would like it.
Oh really! Why not?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite character in toy story?
First movie, or the full franchise?
Any of them, mine was the army men, I always wanted to play with mine when I watched it.
I always like Mr. Potato-Head.
He was hilarious.
I loved seeing him get him and his pieces flew everywhere.
That and when he put himself together the wrong way.
Yeah, I loved it when he said, "I'm Picasso!"
It makes me laugh everytime
My favorite would have to be when his flap came open and he got embarrassed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Alice in Wonderland?
Which one?
The movie with Johnny Depp and directed by Tim Burton.
No, I've only seen the cartoon version. Are they the same?
I haven't seen the cartoon version but maybe they are the same with some changes
Which character does Johnny Depp play?
He's the Mad Hatter.
Johnny Depp has worked for Tim Burton in almost all his movies.
Not only Johnny also Helena Bonham Carter. In the movie she is the Red Queen.
They both with Tim Burton have made a lot of movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does Cinderella marry Prince Charming at the end of Cinderella?
I can't tell you. Watch it and find out.
Come on and tell me.
No. I will tell you that it is a great film worth watching.
Oh okay. Is it well made?
Yes. The makers did an amazing job.
Did it come out in the 80's?
No, it is much older than that.
What is the story?
Cinderella is a slave to her stepmother
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite disney movie?
There are many to choose from, but when I was a kid I loved Robin Hood.
Why is that?
Baloo and Little John were the same voice actor, Phil Harris, and he was the funniest character to me.
Didn't Robin Hood use some of the same animation as the Jungle Book? Why not the Jungle Book?
The Jungle Book is great too, but the action and humor in Robin Hood was better in my opinion.
I guess that makes sense. Theres no stagecoach robbing or storming of a castle in the Jungle Book.
What about you? What was your favorite Disney movie?
I like the female empowerment of Mulan.
Good call. She was very self-reliant.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mate, have you seen the live action Jungle Book.
The one directed by Jon Favreau.
Yeah that's the one.
Yeah why?
Do you know who played King Louis?
No, I thought it was all CGI.
Yeah that animals were but they had real actors voicing them. Anyway King Louis was voiced by Christopher Walken.
Christopher Walken. No way.
Ha ha, you do such a great Christopher Walken.
Ha ha, everyone needs to learn to do a Christopher Walken expression. You could say it's the bare necessities of life!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
Lilo and Stitch
Why is Lilo and Stitch your favorite movie?
I love the part when Lilo uses kitchen spoons to make voodoo images of her friends.
Oh yeah! Then she places them in a pickle jar.
...and shakes it up.
Yes! Because her friends needed to be punished for making fun of her.
Lilo makes me laugh.
I can see why Lilo and Stitch is your favorite movie.
Don't get me started on Stitch.  I can talk about him all day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The other day I went to the movie theater and saw the new Disney movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tale. Did you see it already?
No I haven't seen it. Did you enjoyed it?
Yes I did. It was very entertaining. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow did not disappoint.
I love his character. He really gets into his role and does a great job always.
Yes, he does. I also loved how everything ties in with the previous movies. When you see it you will see.
now I'm intrugued. I can't wait to see it.
you will be laughing so much your stomach will hurt. And the other characters are amazing too. Don't want to tell you too much, I'm afraid of reveling any spoilers.
Don't say anything else. This weekend is the perfect time to see it.
Go and i know you will enjoy this Pirates of the Caribbean. It's lots of fun and the CGI special effects are amazing. Have fun!
I certainly will and now even more after your great reviews. Thank you so much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Finding Dory?
I haven't. I want to, but haven't.
It's reallly good, you should check it out.
I loved Ellen DeGeneres as Dory in Finding Nemo, I bet I'd love Finding Dory.
Yes, if you liked the first you will love the second. What Disney movies do you like?
A lot of them, Disney productions are always great. Bambi is one of my favorites.
Really? I have trouble watching that. It always makes me cry.
It is hard to watch Bambi's Mother get shot, but I love all of the little animals.
Flower the Skunk is so cute, and Thumper is too.
Yes, they're two of my favorites. I also love the song "April Showers" that plays in the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the movie Frozen.
Me too.  It's so creative.
Disney is amazing in all they do.
I love to hear their music in the movies especially.
What was your favorite Disney movie?
Mine has to be The Jungle Book.
I love that one too.
They have great music as well in there.
You never forget the tunes.  They are performed by top notch musicians.
I can't wait to see Beauty and the Beast.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Not yet, is it any good?
It's amazing! I really enjoyed watching it in theaters, so I bought it when it came out!
Awesome! I may have to see about renting it.
You really should. I think you will like it.
Does it go along the same storyline as the original? Are the songs the same?
For the most part they stuck to the storyline, they added a little, but it helps the story along. And I was surprised at how well Emma Watson sings!
Nice! I have been a little apprehensive because I loved the original so much.
I totally understand. I was worried I might not like it as much, but I wasn't disappointed at all.
Alright, you've sold me, I'll be renting it this weekend!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Second Guardians of The Galaxy movie?
Yeah that movie is hilarious.
I saw it too and really liked it.
It is a great movie. I am so glad Disney owns Marvel.
Me too. I loved the jokes in this one.
I still love the characters Star Lord and Gamora.
Their banter is so funny. That other guy is hilarious too.
Which one?
Yondu. He is kinda greyish green with the red veins.
Oh yeah I love that guy. He has a great dry sense of humor in the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey do you have a favorite disney movie?
umm yeah i would have to say it is tarzan
oh tarzan was a really good one thats my favortie also
yeah i liked the idea of him being raised by apes
yeah that was really cool, and the love story of meeting jane
yeah they were cute together
i hated the hunter friends of jane though
yeah they were the bad guys but after some conflict they lost in the end
yeah tarzan is so stron and he outsmartedt hem with the help of his friends
exactly his little ape friend and elephant were so comical
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is The Jungle Book scary?
Not at all. The bad guy is a tiger and even he is not that scary.
What is it about?
A kid that gets raised by wolves in the jungle.
That sounds interesting.
Have you seen it?
Not yet. I heard it is good though.
It is one of the best Disney films ever.
Are there any elephants in it?
Yes, many.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lion king or Aladdin? Which is better to you?
Aladdin loved robin williams genie. you?
I have to go with Lion  King.
Why is that?
Well a lot of disney films are based on fairy tales, Lion King was an original story.
I did not know that, pretty cool.
Also the elton john song, can you feel the love tonight is so good.
That was a good song, won an oscar I think.
I know it was nominated not sure if it won.
Either way that was a powerful  and popular song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
No! I have heard great things about it.
I haven't seen it either but I wanted to see it in theaters.
I always loved the animated version when I was a kid.
Same! My favorite character was the cup Chip.
What other Disney movies did you enjoy?
I loved other princess movies such as Cinderella, Snow White and The Little Mermaid.
I always sung the songs from Snow White on my way to school.
Heigh ho, heigh ho it's off to work (school) we go!
I wonder if in the new Beauty and the Beast movie they sing the same songs from the original.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite disney animated movie?
Oh, probably one of the classics, like Snow White.
Really, I like something a little more modern, like Lion King.
That is a good story, and they did such an amazing job with the animation.
I know, I love the story but I also love how beautiful the film is.
When I went to the animal kingdom I went on the safari ride and it reminded me of the movie.
But you still perfer Snow White.
Yes, and I loved the new seven dwarfs roller coaster they have at Disneyworld.
I wish they would do something like that for Lion King.
Well, they did turn it into a Broadway show, so they have that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like that new movie that came out this year
What movie was it
I think it was called Moana or something
Oh yeah that is Disney newest movie
I really like it
I thought it was good
It is one of the best new ones
Yeah it is
I hope their is another
I know
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Aladdin when you were a little kid?
Yes, all the time! It was my favorite.
I loved the music in it so much.
"One Jump Ahead" is my favorite, especially when that one lady sings "still I think he's rather tasty" in a weird voice.
My favorite is "Prince Ali," I love the scene during that song, there's so much going on!
Aladdin and Jasmine both had such cute pets, too.
I would definitely be happy to have Abu or Rajah as a pet. They were both very loyal.
Though Abu was a little mischievous!
I was surprised he listened to Aladdin and gave those kids his bread!
He was so cute and pouty because he didn't want to, though. The kids were very happy with him!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what was your favorite Disney movie?
My favorite was frozen
Yes, it's also one of my favorites
The music was awesome
Yes , I still love to hear the song "Let it Go"
I can't wait to see frozen two
I hear it is do out in 2019
It's been so long I wish it was out already
Yes, anxious to see what's next  for the characters
Right , and more fantastic music i'm sure
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you go to cinema to watch Cars 3 during the weekend?
No, I am not a fan of Disney's cartoon movies.
That is a pity. The movie is quite entertaining indeed.
What do you like most about Cars 3?
Well, I like many things, like the characters and storylines, but I like the music most.
Do you like other Disney movies?
Yeah, such as Pirates of Caribbean and Star Wars.
Star Wars is produced by Disney?
Yeah, Disney bought Lucas's films a few years ago.
That is interesting. It looks Disney produces many different types of movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they'll do a live action of The Little Mermaid now that they've done one for Beauty and the Beast?
Under water?
It wouldn't be the first underwater movie to exist.
Good point. I don't know! I would definitely see it.
Did you see the Broadway musical?
I didn't! Did you?
Yeah! It was so good and so creative. Makes me want to see a live action movie!
Oh, I would definitely see it if it existed. I've just never thought about it.
I hope they would keep some of the songs from the musical.
As long as Part of Your World is in it, I'd see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that the new Enchanted is being filmed this year?
What! No way! Do they have a set date yet?
I don't think so, but I am very excited about it.
It is one of the most relatable Disney movies ever.
I agree. Amy Adams is amazing.
She plays the part perfectly.
Beauty and the Beast is out on Apple TV now too!
I know! I can't wait to re-watch it.
It was definitely a hit and I loved all the remastered songs.
Emma Watson did wonderful as Belle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which one do you like better, Sleeping Beauty or Snow White?
Oh, that's a hard one.  Snow White is the first full length Disney so it's awesome.
But Sleeping Beauty has the three fairies and Maleficent.
Yeah, but Sleeping Beauty is hardly in her own movie.
But Snow White goes on a long time.  I mean, we spend a long time cleaning that cabin.
Well, what do you want her to do in the miners cabin?
At least in Sleeping Beauty she knew the prince before he kissed her awake.
True.  The end of Snow White is slightly creepy
I mean, oh she's a dead pretty lady, let me kiss her and marry her is she wakes up?
It is a cartoon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I rewatched the movie Wall-E last night.
Oh that is such a great movie.
I know, I can't believe it's been almost ten years since it came out.
That long?  Wow.
And the first 30 minutes are so good.
I remember.  There is like no dialogue in it.
It is crazy.  No dialogue but it holds your attention the whole time.
And WALL-E was so cute.
Adorable.  I wanted to have a pet WALL-E.
Me too!  I'll have to rewatch it tonight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
BFG is such a weird name for a Disney movie, don't you think?
Yeah, the Big Friendly Giant is a little weird, too, but I like him.
He seems scary at first, but when you see him with the other giants, you realize that he's really kind of weak and scared.
I'm glad he figured out how to defeat those other giants; they were bullies.
I think it's hard to figure out who the real hero is in the movie: Sophie or BFG.
I think they are both heroes because Sophie comes up with the plan, but BFG has to be brave enough to do it.
I love the Queen character; at first she's kind of serious, but then she brings Sophie and BFG into the castle for breakfast.
The poor servants that had to serve BFG; I felt sorry for them.
What about the part of the breakfast when everyone drank the frobscottle?
Oh, that was the funniest and most disgusting part of the movie!  I laughed until I cried.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think makes the best movies in the movie industry?
Definitely Disney, hands down.
Why's that?
They just have so much range at this point. They started out with hand-drawn cartoons, then added live action, and now they have animation too.
They bought Marvel too, so they're in charge of all the superhero films pretty much.
Yep, every superhero except the DC Universe ones, which is pretty much just Batman and Superman.
Didn't they buy another entity as well?
Yea they bought that Star Wars franchise.
Oh wow, that probably cost them a ton of money.
Probably, but it's definitely worth it. The new Star Wars movies are going to make them billions of dollars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new live action Beauty and the Beast movie?
You mean the one with Emma Watson?
Ya the one with Emma Watson and Kevin Kline.
Yes I did see that movie with my children when it first came out
And did you enjoy it?
I did! but you know the original cartoon will always be my favorite
Well the original was quite the classic
I know right! and can you believe how old it is now?
well how old is the original Beauty and the Beast?
It came out in 1991 so it is now 26 years old!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hope you saw Disney's Inside Out.
Yep I did. Good right?
Yeah, so clever. How did they come up with the premise.
Guess they wanted to explain emotions to kids.
But the representation was so interesting.
Very clever and unique. I'm glad they did it.
Its a good movie for kids.
Positive, too. So kids can understand.
That they are in control and that feelings are good.
Yeah it had an uplifting message.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the Haunted Mansion was based around a Disney ride?
That was the movie with Eddie Murphy right?
Yes it was.
Yeah I heard it was based around that
I just dont know how you make an entire plot based on that.
Well it worked for a long time
Was the movie well received?
It really was hit or miss
Murphy has done some good films for Disney
This one though wasnt one of his finer works
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cant wait to see Mary Poppins returns next year!
Yeah I heard that was going to be a fantastic movie
Did you see the first Mary poppins?
A long time ago when I was a boy back in 1969
That was a long time ago, did you enjoy it back then?
yeah, it was a moment to remember thats for sure.. just like that one disney film Mulan!
Yeah I heard about that, there making a Live action version of that.. I cant wait!
thats pretty cool! Mulan was a Disney classic to be sure
yeah nothing beats Disney films there timeless
I agree, these films really bring people together!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Bambi?
A long time ago when I was a kid my mom took me to see it. I've never seen it since.
Either have I and I'd like to.  One of my earliest memories is my mother taking me to see it in Alaska.
Really at the theater?
Well kind of. It was on the Aleutian Islands back in the late sixties and the theater was an old WWII Quonset Hut and there was about fifteen of us in there.
Wow, that's different.  Did you like the movie?
I remember that I did and of course I know the story of Bambi and oh, that rabbit.  What's his name?
Thumper and Flower the skunk.
That's right.  How could I forget Thumper.  One of the most famous rabbits out there.
Rates rite up there with Peter Cotton tail.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the song "How Far I'll Go" from Moana.
Oh, I've heard the song before. It's sung by Alessia Cara?
In the Moana it's sung by Auli'i Cravalho.
What Moana about?
It's about a Polynesian girl who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with a goddess.
Is there anyone famous in the movie?
Yeah, Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson plays Maui a Demi-god that helps Moana save her island from dying.
Cool. Is it a typical "the heroine falls in love and lives happily ever after" story?
No way! It's about a strong independent girl who risks her life to save her people.
That's great! I hate it when Disney makes movies about a girl's happiness is dependent on romance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Cool Runnings?
I've watched that, like, a million times.
They used to play it on TV all the time, huh?
Yeah, I also had in on VHS. The tape became grainy after watching it so much.
John Candy was great in it. I wish he would've lived longer.
Yeah, we missed out on so many great movies when he died.
I love how the movie still gets referenced today every Winter Olympics.
Especially if a bob sled team from a country that isn't cold enters.
Every time and Australian bob sled team tries to go there our media interviews them because of this movie.
It has quite a legacy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know which movie Disney should do as a live action?
Which one?
Peter Pan.
Never happen.
Why?
There are so many Peter Pan movies.
True, but not very many good ones.
True. the Disney animation was the best to date.
I'm still holiding out hope.
Well, don't hold your breath!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier.
The Disney movie?
Yes, 1955.
Who directed it?
Norman Foster
Wasn't that a compilation of tv shows?
Yes, three episodes.
That's like cheating, I think.
I guess it made money for Disney.
I heard they made a prequel tv episode.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that they released the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
I did. I can't wait to see it.
Me either. I have loved all of the other ones.
Is Johnny Depp still playing Jack Sparrow?
He is, and Javier Bardem is in this one as well.
Awesome! I really enjoy his movies.
What is this movie called?
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. I think it might be the last one.
Bummer! I was hoping they would keep making them.
Yeah, me too. I would probably watch ten more if they made them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
the indiana jones movies are the best thign disney has done
i certainly don't think so!
harrison ford makes movies and you know it!
yeah, but does he make good movies?
...yikes. okay. go on. what do you think disney is doing right, then?
honestly nothing...
but if you had to pick a favorite!
i guess i'd have to go with mary poppins
are you kidding?
yeah, of course. disney sucks, end of.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite? Tinker Bell or Wendy?
Tinker Bell, no question.
Why Tinker Bell?
Tinker Bell has that pixie dust. She can fly and everything.
What about Wendy Darling?
Wendy is okay, but she leaves Peter and the boys to go grow up.
Yeah, but she went back to her family. I assume her parents missed her.
Sure, but she still left the boys behind.
The Lost Boys would never leave.
I still like Tinker Bell much more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about movies
I love movies
Cool, do you like disney movies
Yes
I loved a cinderella story
With hillary duff?
Yes
That one was good
I loved the ending
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Disney Princess?
I would say Jasmine
Yea, the whole Aladdin atmosphere makes her an easy choice
Cinderalla is too cliche
Yea, I didn't really like her story
Snow White is pretty cool though
Yea, those dwarves made her more of an interesting character.
Mulan had an interesting life
I would love to meet her in real life!
You can't! Its fiction
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to go see Cars 3?
Yes! I've been waiting for it to come out.
Me too! Lightning McQueen and Mater are two of my favorite characters.
Who would have ever thought that automobile characters could be so entertaining?!
I was hesitant about seeing the second Cars movie because I didn't think it could be as good as the first one.
I know I was too. Disney has a way to make sequels great too.
That's what I love about Disney!
Disney definitely has a way of making great movies!
Do you want to go see Cars 3 together tomorrow?
That sounds great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what's funny? I've never even seen Hercules.
What? You're missing out.
Yeah, I've seen basically every other Disney movie, but I somehow missed that one.
We should totally watch it. Hercules is such a cutie.
Is there a princess in that movie?
Yeah, Meg! She's so sassy.
Oh, is she the one who sings I Won't Say I'm In Love?
Yeah, that's her!
Oh, right. Hercules is the one with the gospel choir.
Yeah that's my favorite part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We were watching a couple Disney movies on dvd at my aunt's house this weekend, and one of them was Moana. My aunt was telling me how this movie made people upset.
It's a Disney movie, what could people be upset about?
Apparently, the character Maui is a big huge guy, and it upset people because they felt it was sterotyping Polynesians as fat.
Well, some of them are really big.
The character isn't meant really to even be so much as fat though, as he is just really big and strong.
But so what if he is fat? Why do people have to look at fat as bad and sterotyping? That's like saying if you are fat, it's bad.
Especially with it being a kid's movie, cause a lot of kids these days are overweight, so it's kind of indirectly shaming them if you say there's something bad about Disney making him so big.
Exactly. And I don't think kids would even see it that way, without adults coloring their persception by pointing it out.
It's like the adults are saying if you are big, you can't just blend in, you are noticable.
It's a shame people have to ruin something innocent like a Disney movie by making a controversy about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the animated version or movie version of The Jungle Book better?
To be honest I have never seen the movie version.
You haven't? Why not?
Because I loved the animated version as a kid. I did not want the movie version to disappoint me and take away from that.
Why would you think it would.
I just did not think the Shere Khan, Bagheera and especially Balou could be properly represented in a real life version.
I thought they did an ok job.
See you said ok. But in the animated version they were spectacular!
Do you think you will ever watch the movie version?
Probably not as I just cannot picture a real bear singing Bear Necessities.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite song in a Disney cartoon?
Hakuna Matata
Is that in the Lion King?
Yes
That is a good one. Do you like When You Wish Upon a Star?
Yes, I love it.
That might be the most memorable one.
Do you love Pinocchio?
Yeah, it is one of my favorite movies.
I had no idea it came out in the 40's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the Disney movie Lady and The Tramp?
Yes, I remember watching it as a kid. It was such a great movie!
It's one of my favorite animated movies. Do you know what year it came out?
I'm not sure, but I think it was in the 1950s.
Let's check IMDB. Wow, you were right. It came out in 1955.
What is your favorite scene in the movie?
The spaghetti scene of course! Which is your favorite scene?
Same. Love the spaghetti scene.
Hey, we should rent a movie tonight. Any suggestions?
Lady and The Tramp!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I never really liked Disney movies as a kid.
Oh, I did. Especially the old ones like Sleeping Beauty.
Bambi was devastating though.
True. And I cried so hard during dumbo.
What did you think of 90's Disney movies?
I really liked The Little Mermaid.
Beauty and the Beast was good too. Have you seen the new version?
I haven't seen the new version yet.
My niece is obsessed with Frozen.
I like what they've done with the princess genre.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My friend at work mentioned a movie called Tangled. Do you think my daughter would like it for her birthday?
Definitely, I think she'd love it.
What's it about?
It's the story of Rapunzel.
Is that the Princess with the long hair in the tower?
Yep, that's the one.
Okay. When did it release?
I want to say 2010, but I'm not sure.
I'll check it out, thanks.
You're welcome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Monsters, Inc.
Yeah
What did you think of the story
I thought the whole idea was cool, how they started getting people to laugh instead of cry
It is funny that all the bad guys did was scare people
You know what the funniest part of the movie was? It was when the green guy was covered by the company logo on the commercial
I don't remember that.
The city of monsters was an interesting concept
You understood why they wanted to scare kids
I liked the scare meter scenes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Disney character growing up?
I always liked the genie from Aladdin.
The one voiced by Robin Williams?
Yeah, he always made me laugh with his antics.
He was always a cut up.
Especially when he was getting cut up.
True. Do you ever find yourself singing his first song.
I still sing it everyday almost.
I catch myself humming it now and then when I hear the word friend.
Well you ain't never had a friend like me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Thank goodness my son is too young to be into Disney movies. I love them, but I can't stand to watch the same movie over and over again.
Oh, he will get there. You just wait.
Hmm. I wonder which movie he will be into the most.
Probably Frozen.
Olaf is the greatest, and they have part two coming out in the future.
Yeah, my kids can't wait. I'm looking forward to having a new song blaring in the car on repeat. I hope it's as catchy as Let it Go.
Disney does a pretty good job with their soundtracks.
Yes they do.
I'm feeling a solo coming on...
Oh please, don't start singing in public again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the most beautiful disney princess to you?
In terms of spirit snow white, she was gentle and loving. You?
I am torn so many good ones. Maybe jasmine.
I liked how feisty she was. Also her outfit was pretty great.
Ya, disney does a great job creating great iconic looks.
Don't forget characters too. I think they have come a long way in developing characters.
Yes even though I love snow white also.. Jasmine for example is far more developed in personality and depth.
I think that could be said of most of their work, as time goes one it grows deeper in character development.
Yes true , characters are more complex now, take frozen people are not always just the obvious bad guy.
True more twists also or surprises than in disney's original  animated films like snow white.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Bambi the other day.
That's an oldie.  When did that come out?
1942.
Cool.  Who did Bambi's voice?
Bobby Stewart.
And Thumper?
Peter Behn.
What was your favorite scene?
When Bambi's mother gets killed.
I cried when that happened.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Moana is on Netflix now?
No I didn't! That's exciting!
I agree, I've been wanting to see it.
Even better, we can watch it at home now!
Would you like to watch it together tonight?
Yes, I would enjoy that. I've heard the music is very good.
It is, Moana's song sounds good.
I want to hear the song the crab sings.
Oh yeah, I think it's called Shiny.
This is gonna be so fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is a underrated disney movie?
treasure planet
thats true.
the soundtrack is so good.
yeah, the goo goo dolls were on it, right?
yeah, the sound was called i'm still here.
the movie was emotional
it was sad and beautiful
it had a lot of emotions all over it
i agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think people still like Fantasia?
I dont know anyone who did like it.
It was a huge hit
Yeah but for what reasons
Probably because Mickey was in it.
I think the acting was good.
There was no acting!
True, the story was just about music.
Yeah the animations were phenomenal though.
This is true, but I dont get its allure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who never gets enough attention or recognition ?
no, who?
Fiagaro. He is an adorable character.
The cat from Pinocchio?
Yep. He was also in other works by Disney.
I never realized that, like what?
A bunch of Disney short films as Minnie Mouse's pet, replacing Fifi.
Wow they must have liked Figaro, Replacing Fifi seems extreme. Poor Fifi.
Walt disney like Figaro so much he made that choice. Also put him in Disney's House of Mouse.
So maybe you are wrong, he seemed to get a lot of recognition and attention from disney. Just maybe not the public as much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really think the movie Brave was a nice example of courage; how about you?
Eh, I don't think so. The movie was just kind of...boring. I mean, her mom got turned into a bear? Seriously?
Yeah, but Merida was pretty brave, right?
Hmm, I guess so. but her three brothers are kind of just the comic relief.
You're right about that, to be honest.
Although, they were helpful when they provided a distraction.
I really liked her Scottish culture.
Me too, I like foreign culture movies.
Like Aladdin, which takes place in Arabia.
Yeah!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that recent Disney movie
Moana? Yeah it was so good!
I was laughing so much in the theater
Yeah it's very funny, who was your favorite character
I loved the character played by the rock
oh, he was great in this movie. I loved his song
Your Welcome was the best!
I even bought the soundtrack
I loved the animation
Yeah the colors just popped out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the first Disney movie you ever saw?
Whoa, that's a hard question! Do you remember what you first saw?
I don't know if it's technically the first movie I saw, but the first one I remember seeing is Bambi.
Oh, that movie is so sad!
I know, especially for a little kid, right!?
It's been awhile since I've seen that movie, but I still remember the line "If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all", or something like that.
Thumper, right?
Yup, I think it's what his mom taught him.
A lot of DIsney movies involve talking animals, don't they?
Yeah, I think a lot of them do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Disney sidekick is definitely Mushu.
He's okay, but not the best.
So who do you prefer?
Timon and Pumba!
Wait, why?
Hakuna Matata is a good song and a great life philosophy.
Not a bad point. Mushu can breathe fire though!
Ok, hardly. I prefer the horse from Mulan, honestly.
Haha you're right, that horse is great.
Way better than Mushu.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie, bro?
I have to go with The Lion King?
Nice, why that one?
It holds up greatly.
Explain how, I'm curious.
It has memorable and lovable characters, important themes, and an overall great storyline.
Awesome explantion.
Thanks now can I explain why I love my second favorite; Beauty and the Beast?
Sure, go for it!
It's totally because I had a childhood crush on Belle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think is the saddest scene in Disney
either up or lion king
honestly I was going to say the same.
mufasa and the adulthood scene
I almost cried in the theaters during up
that scene was beautiful
pixar is so great at those emotive scenes
that was them at their finest
so sad...and then mufasa dying.
that haunted me
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what was the original one with Maleficent?
She was the big baddie in Sleeping Beauty.
Right. How did that one go?
It was sort of similar to Snow White.
Oh, how so?
Well, Princess Aurora, that was her name, was cured to die but instead fell into a long sleep because of guardian angels.
Then what happens?
Exactly what you think. She has to be awoken by a kiss. Prince Phillip was the prince.
And everyone lives happily ever after?
Don't they always?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe Disney, one of my favorite genres (yes.. its a genre ;) ) owns Marvel AND Star Wars now?!
Its nuts. All my favorite superhero's, space battles and princess's in one place. It's great!
Disney seems like it can do no wrong lately.
Most have all been gems.
I know. And! a new Star Wars every year.. just awesome..
Some Star Wars fan was granted their three wishes for sure.
It was me, "I rubbed the lamp!"
Hehe. I'd believe it. Your such a fan boy.
Totaly, but my third wish wasn't for that. Can you guess?
A helper monkey with a cute little hat?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the sequel to Mary Poppins?
No, just no.  I can't.
Why not! I love Emily Blunt!
Because I don't think you can recreated that magic. And Julie Andrews is so perfect!
Yes, she won an Oscar for it. But, I think the sequel will be great.
And it won't have Dick Van Dyke.
Hey, he's not dead.
But if he is in it, he'll be ancient. Why not make something new?
Well, there were multiple Mary Poppins books.
I don't care.  I don't want to watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the movie The Shaggy D.A. ?
No.
Really, It's a comedy about a dog.
No, who's in it?
Well, it's an old Disney movie from the 70's. No newer actors.
No wonder I don't know it.
Tim Conway is in. Do you remember that actor?
No, can't say that I do.
Okay, well then I guess it don't matter.
Sorry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new live-action Beauty and the Beast?
Yeah, I did see it, but I wasn't the biggest fan.
Why didn't you like it?
It didn't seem to have the same magic as the animated version.
I thought it did. Why did you think that?
The songs just weren't the same and I think Emma Watson's acting was a bit flat.
I loved Emma Watson in it!
She just didn't capture Belle from the animated version very well.
I still think she did a decent job. Oh well, I guess you'll always have the original then.
Yeah, I won't be adding the new one to my collection anytime soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved the Mighty Ducks
Emilio Estevez was a great head coach.
I just think it was a good sports movie too.
It was so big that it spawned an actual NHL franchise.
hard to believe that could happen.
Yeah but the movie overall was so good.
Joshua Jackson playing the role of Charlie was perfect.
When they initially hated the coach.
Gordon Bombay hated the team too
Yeah I forgot he was coaching for community service.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I agree, the song "Let it go" is still being played everywhere.
Yes it is, I love that song.
My favorite is "Do you want to build a snowman".
Oh yes, I forgot about that one.
I like it so much because Olaf is my favorite character.
Olaf is the snowman right?
Yup! He's so cute.
My favorite character has to be Elsa.
Have you seen the Broadway performance of Frozen?
No Io haven't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Disney movie Cinderella?
Of course hasn't everyone?
I love that movie!  I wish I had a fairy godmother!
Me too.  Cinderella is so beautiful!
Yes and I love that she is kind to everyone.
She loves animals too!
Yes she does and they love her just as much!  They even made her a dress!
Oh yeah, I forgot that part.  Aren't those little mice the cutest things?
Yes, they are.  That is a fun movie to watch.
I think so too.  Maybe someday I will meet my prince charming!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
Aladdin
Any specific reason why?
Aladdin is just so awesome@
Why?
He's like reverse cinderella
HOw?
He goes from poor to rich!
I guess they're alike in that way.
Yea, hes awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
HAVE YOU SEEN THE LION KING
YES. I HAD WAITED FOR WEEKS FOR ITS RELEASE
WAS IT EVERYTHING YOU EXPECTED
YES,AND EVEN MORE.
WHAT MADE IT SO SPECIAL WAS THE SONGS
YES,ESPECIALLY AT THE FIRST OPENING SCENE
YOU MEAN THERE ON THE MOUNTAIN AND THEM PLAYING THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
YEP. THAT PUT IT OVER FOR ME
I BELIEVE I COULD SET THROUGH ANTHER SHOWING
I KNOW I'LL HAVE TO WITH MY TWO YOUNGEST HAVING NOT GOTTEN TO SEE IT THIS TRIP
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I really liked Aladdin. Robin Williams as the Genie was the best character ever.
I like Aladdin too. Didn't they make a second one?
I think so, but it had a different person as the Genie and it wasn't as good.
Maybe they'll do a live version of Aladdin like they did with Beauty and the Beast.
I would be interested in that, but it could still be hard to cast for the Genie.
Some characters just can't be replaced.
What do you think about Lion King?
Great movie! It made me cry.
I think all Disney movies made me cry at some point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is there a Disney movie you don't like?
Only one! Fantasia.
I didn't like that one either.
My favorite movie is The Little Mermaid.
Disney is awesome. I love Ariel!
Do you like her better as a mermaid or human?
Mermaid of course!
She was a cute human though!
Yeah. I love her blue dress and big bow.
I do too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think of all the Princess had the best movie?
Like Disney princess you mean?
Yep, like Belle and snow white.
I would have to go with Princess Leai.
She is not a Disney princess!
She is, now, Disney bought the rights to her films.
Well, then the cartoon ones.
I would have to go with Aurora.
From Sleeping Beauty?
Yep. She was tuff and sweet and I really liked the dance scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Frozen?
No, not yet, I haven't.
Really? I feel like everybody's seen it by now.
Yeah, I haven't really had the desire, but there's a lady at work who is obsessed with Olaf.
Oh my gosh, Olaf is my favorite! I have a stuffed Olaf at home.
I see him all the time when I go to Target, kids seem to love him.
I'm not surprised, he really is a fan favorite; maybe even more popular than Elsa!
Who is Elsa? Is she the one with white hair?
Elsa is the main character in Frozen. Man, you really have a lot of catching up to do!
I really do, I'm not hip with the jive anymore. What are you doing this weekend?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Cars 3 trailer? The graphics changed a lot.
Well, the other trailers didn't have the same quailty, but still better than the first two.
It must have been to for the dramatic scene then.
Yeah, some scenes are given extra details in animation.
When I see a drastic shift in art quailty, I get taken out of the movie.
Lightning McQueen crashing like that and changing from plastic to a gritty art style will make people notice.
I know they do that to get people feel a certain way but still.
It's just a trailer. Maybe the whole movie will still look like plastic.
Yeah, the trailer is sometimes different than the movie.
I can't wait to see how it turns out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is one of your favorite Disney movies?
101 Dalmatians
Yes, I love that one.
I love the animation style.
Yeah, it was quite a departure from the usual Disney films.
I agree. Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella were drawn so elegantly.
Yes and 101 Dalmatians was very rough looking.
I liked how you could see the pencil in the art.
Yeah, it definitely added to the evil of Cruella de Vil.
Her song is so memorable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No, I haven't seen it yet.
I want to go see it so bad!  It looks amazing!  I love Captain Jack!
I love those movies, should we make a plan to go together?
Yes I would love to, I'll get the tickets for us!  I can't wait to see Javier Bardem in this new movie!
Oh I forgot he plays the villain!  He is a great actor!
Yes I enjoy watching him, so shall we go next week?
Yes that sounds like a great plan.  If you will grab the tickets I will pay for the snacks!
Great, can't wait!
See you then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can  you think of any recent Disney movies that spawned hit songs?
Well, Disney often has really catchy songs.  But the only one that comes to mind is "Paint with all the colors of the wind"
That was from  Pochahontas,right?
Yeah, I think that was it.  The one with the Indian and the Pilgrim
Yeah, that was like, the mid 90's
Who sang that song anyway?  It wasn't the movie version that made the charts, was it?
Wasn't it Vanessa Williams?
Yeah, but those movies have had some great songs.  Like Let it Go from Frozen?
Or most of the songs from The Little Mermaid
Heck,going back to Snow White there were some great songs!  Hi Ho, Hi Ho, it's off to work we go...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard that they are making a Broadway musical of Frozen?
Wow, that's great! I love Broadway musicals!
I hope they add more songs. I love the ones that are there already, of course, especially "Let It Go."
I think my favorite is "For the First Time in Forever."
It's interesting, though. I wonder if the Elsa they choose will be able to top Idina Menzel.
Or Kristen Bell? But I didn't even know that she could sing before she played Anna.
I wonder how they will do the parts with Sven talking with Kristoff.
Yeah, obviously they won't use a live animal, but a costume for a person, maybe?
And would Olaf be a costume or a puppet?
Because of his size, I think a puppet might work better, but who knows?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is you favorite animated Film?
It has to be Toy Story.
Really, why?
I just love how the characters have life and have their own little world.
Did you see all the 3 movies?
Of course I did! I still think the first one was the best one.
Which is your favorite character from the saga.
I´m going to sound very cliché, but it´s Woody.
What was your favorite scene from the first movie?
When all the toys are Trying to figure out what Andy got for Christmas.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen big hero 6?
Yes that movie was great.
My town did a movie in the park and they played that.
That sounds so nice, i wish my town did that.
It was nice, you bring blankets or whatever and they display it on a big screen
I bet the kids loved that
They did, and it was a really good movie
I havent seen it in a while i want to watch it again
Me too
I was thinking about buying it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ever notice that Disney movies have a real thing for orphans?
You know, I think I heard someone else mention that before...
Yeah, seriously, about every films centers around someone who's an orphan.
Or will be an orphan, a la The Lion King or Frozen.
Yeah, that's trues.
I think most of it goes back to the fact a lot of the movies are based on old fairy tales and stuff, lots of orphans there.
Yeah, I mean, you got Aladdin, no mom and no dad.
Well, actually, his dad shows up in the third movie.
Oh, really?  Actually, I didn't see that one...
Yeah, he turns out to be like the king of all thieves or something... been a few years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard there  will be another "Frozen" movie.
Yes. I am anxious to take the family.
You have to wait a long time.
Really? When will it be here?
It won't be in theaters until Noivember 2019
I am sure there will be songs we will all  be singing for months.
Disney  has a way of keeping us singing.
My children fall asleep singing, "Do you want to build a snowman?"
And I hear "Let It Go" all day.
LOL It's easier to build that snowman!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do all of the Disney classic movies have singing in them?
I don't think they do. There are live action ones that don't.
But the animated ones?
Most do for sure, but I don't know about all of them. There are a few I haven't seen.
Which ones?
I never saw the Black Cauldron and it has been years since I've seen Sword in the Stone.
Those certainly aren't the more popular ones.
No, definitely not.
I really like the ones from the early 90s and late 80s.
Well that's when we got Beauty and the Beast, the Little Mermaid, and Lion King so I can see why!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Wreck-it Ralph?
Yes. That movie was hilarious.
Who was the voice actor for Ralph?
John C. Reilly
That guy is so funny.
What did you think of the movie?
I loved it. I liked that girl who was called a glitch.
You mean Vanellope Von Schweetz.
Oh, right. Who was the voice actor for her?
That was actually Sarah Silverman.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Aladdin?
Yes, why?
What's the deal with the genie?
What do you mean?
Why does he make '80s references if it's in the past?
That's a good question .
I know, right?
Maybe its not set in the past, maybe it's the future.
Mind blown.
You're welcome
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the candelabra from the beauty and the beast?
I think it was Lumiere?
Oh yeah, he was my favorite when I was a kid.
I liked Mrs. Potts with her little tea cup kid.
Right, wasn't his name chip?
Yeah, I probably can guess, but what was your favorite song?
Obviously it was be our guest.
True, I can't help but singing that when I stay at a hotel.
Me either, I'd freak if my furniture came to life and started singing though.
I'd have a "ball" ...get it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know how I love those rewards programs they have for things, like gas purchases and airline tickets?
Yes, you always tell me when you get something extra or save money.
Well, now I have a new rewards program I'm using- Disney Movies Rewards.
How do you get rewards for Disney movies?
If you buy eligible movies or theater tickets, you can enter it on the Disney website for points. You can use the points for special offers or rewards.
Do you buy that many movies or theater tickets?
YES. I have three kids. I buy the movies all the time to keep them quiet and entertain them, and I take them to the theatre for special weekend trips with their friends.
You're a really great parent.
My kids love Disney movies, and the new Cars 3 came out this week, so I took them to see it, and already started racking up points.
Maybe you can get some good offers and be able to save on future movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Beauty and the Beast is one of the most unique Disney films.
How so?
Well, usually a character like the Beast would be Villain, right?
Well, maybe, he is a prince or something.
Yeah, but he's also a monster.
Okay. So what else?
Well, the actual villain is a stuck-up version of the character that would usually be the hero.
Ah, so that's what you meant.
Yeah. Gaston and the Beast totally switch roles.
I get that. That's fascinating.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Disney movie "Moana"?
Yes, I thought it had some of the best music since "Frozen".
Who were some of the voice actors?
Dwayne Johnson had a big part. He was the voice for Maui.
Who was the voice actress for Moana?
Auli'i Cravalho was the voice for Moana.
I am not familiar with that actress, but I liked her voice.
I think she is Hawaiian.
I liked "Moana" because it is the first time Disney had a Polynesian princess.
I agree, but i liked the setting best!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched The Incredibles yesterday. It was a mind-blowing movie.
You didn't watch it in past?
Yes, my kid was watching it and I joined him.
Mr. Incredible was such a funny guy.
Yes, the movie kept me captivated for 2 hours.
A normal looking family turns into a superhero family. Isn't it cool?
Yes, are they planning for a sequel?
I guess that they are planning one in March 2018.
I just can't wait for it.
Yes but still a long time to go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love aladdin
Me too
Its one of the best original dosney movies
I completely agree
There was so much action and adventure
Yes it was great
I liked how it was a real pricess and the man was winning her
I know that was a good change
Usually its the other way around
Exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movie would you like to see redone?
I would love to see Disney redo Snow White.
Thats a very classic movie.
The seven dwarfs are the best!
I can never name them all no matter how hard I try.
It takes some practice! I don't know how they would remake it.
I would be interested in who would play the role of Snow White.
Hopefully a new actress.
I'm not sure the story line would be a big hit with todays crowd.
True. But a love story is a love story!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know they're making a third Cars movie?
No, I'm not even sure I remember seeing Cars 2.
I saw Cars 2, it was okay I guess, but not nearly as good as the first movie.
Yeah, the first movie was really original and funny.
So I wonder why they're doing another one?
Probably because they spent so much money on adding a Cars Land to Disneyland.
Oh, I heard about that. Isn't it supposed to be really realistic?
Yeah, the entire area is just like Radiator Springs from the movies.
Well then I can see them wanting to put out another movie to keep people excited.
It makes sense.  I wonder if the movie will be any good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man Disney has gone down the toilet
How?
Well their quality is much worse than it used to be
I dont think that
How so
The movies are as good as ever
Your just fanboying
No i am not
Yes you are
Why do you think that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Bambi?
When I was a kid..
I just watched again, it was really sad.
Maybe I should check it out.
You should, it's really different as an adult
Really, why?
You see the mom, and the other characters differently.
Huh, now I'm really intrigued
You should give it try.
I'm going to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Of all the Disney films, which has the best songs?
Are we talking animated or what?
Just animated, none of the live action stuff.
I would have to go with Mulan.
Really?
Yes, "I'll Make a Man Out of You", is one of the best songs Disney ever made.
I like the one Christina Aguleria sung, when Mulan was looking in the water.
The Reflection song?
Yes, that seemed to play well into the plot.
The plot of a girl saving her country.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you watched Dumbo lately?
Wow, that's really an old one!  No, it's been awhile.
I still love it.  I watched it with my kids the other day.
I never understood the part with the pink elephants.
Oh, it's simple!  Dumbo and the mouse get drunk and start hallucinating.
That seems kinda weird for a kid's movie.
Yeah, there are some really inappropriate things in the movie.  Fortunately I don't think the kids really notice.
Well, it's a sweet story either way.
It really is.  The part where the mother sings Baby Mine is so sweet.
I know!  I still sing that to my children.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you aren't going to believe this.
What? Tell me.
My husband hasn't seen any of the classic disney movies that we grew up on.
What? You're kidding.
No. I realized it when we went to see the new Beauty and the Beast that he hadn't a clue what was going to happen. He kept asking me obvious questions.
Haha, like what?
Like, "Why doesn't she want to be with Gaston? That guy is awesome."
No. He was on Gaston's side?
I kept telling him, no - he's the bad guy. He figured it out in the end.
That's funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait to see the new, live Action Mulan!
they're making that?
oh yeah!
well...will Eddie Murphy be reprising his iconic role as mushu?
sources say no, but that would be cool.
wouldn't it?
they're doing a fairly racially accurate cast so far, though
that's surprising
i know, right? it's disney
they're always messing up
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about disney movies?
I love them
Even the newer ones?
Yes what about you?
Yes i love the newer ones too
They are really addictive
Yes they are
I love watching the new movies on the disney channel
Me too
We make it into a family movie night
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of Disney's scariest movies.
What? I loved the Nightmare before Christmas.
I think it's way too scary for kids.
I watched it as a kid and I might've been a little scared but it's not like I was scarred by it.
Didn't you find some of the characters to be a little unnerving, like the mayor or the doctor?
Well that's one of the main themes, is that things can be different but they don't necessarily have to cause fear.
How do you mean?
Well on halloween Jack is celebrated but when he tries to deliver Christmas presents he's met with fear.
I'd be afraid if he delivered my presents too! But the stop motion christmas scenes were pretty.
They were my favorite part!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Toy Story movies?
Yes, I really did, I can remember seeing the first one in the theater.
Which one of them is your favorite?
I'm not sure, I really like each of them so much.  I guess I'd say Toy Story 3 probably.
Yeah, that was probably my favorite too.  What did you like about it?
I was really impressed with the direction the movie took, and how they dealt with Andy growing up.
I know, and then they even added in some pretty scary parts.
For sure, I was really scared for a while, and then I even started to cry.
Yeah, I cried to.  Although, honestly, I cry at most of the Disney movies that I watch.
It is pretty normal for them to pull on your emotional strings, and trying to convince you that Woody would die is doing just that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like Oz the Great and Powerful?
Overall I liked it okay.
Sounds like you have reservations.
Well it definitely had its ups and downs.
Such as?
The plot wasn't so great.
Ha ha, okay what else?
The actors tried, and the scenes and costumes were great, but something didn't gel.  And James Franco was miscast.
So you liked it on a surface level?
That's right, for entertainment only.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh my goodness!
What? What is it?
Beauty and the Beast is officially tied with Maleficent for my favorite live action Disney movie. Actually Maleficent still wins because Angelina Jolie was AMAZING in that role.
You're telling me. It's one of her best roles in my opinion.
Do you have a favorite live action Disney movie?
As far as remakes go also Maleficent, but in general? Either Honey, I Shrunk the Kids or The Mighty Ducks with Emilio Estevez.
The Mighty Ducks is probably the only sports movie I'll ever watch, and can watch it repeatedly at that. Funnier still is I normally could care less about hockey, but that was a great movie from start to finish.
I don't know man, Air Bud was a pretty good Disney sports movie.
Saw it in theaters and the original was perfect but not quite enough to be in my faves. Plus they made way too many sequels and spin-offs.
That's an understatement! 14 movies is absolutely ridiculous though I really can't fault Disney for wanting to fully take advantage of this cash cow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what was that movie with the that man that was raised by monkeys ?
I think that was that Disney movie Tarzan .
Was Tarzan the name of the main character or just the name of the movie?
I think that was his actual name.
Did the hunter guy kill Tarzan?
No I don't think so it is a Disney movie after all.
Can you even think of a Disney movie in which anyone dies in?
The Lion King, Bambi those are the two main Disney movies I can think of that has someone die.
Wait who in Bambi dies?
Bambi's mother dies by a hunter it happens in like the first few minutes of the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm having a Disney movie marathon!
That's awesome. I love Disney movies!
Me too. They make me feel relaxed and happy.
So which one are you watching now?
Aladdin!
Awesome. I love Pocohontas. Have you watched that one yet?
Yes! That was the first one I watched. It's my favorite.
Mine too. What's your favorite song from it?
I like when she sings The Colors of the Wind.
That song is beautiful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Aladdin?
Yes I have. It is one of my favorite Disney movies,
Who is your favorite character in the movie?
The Genie is by far my favorite. He is probably the funniest character in any of the animated Disney movies.
Who is the actor that plays him.
It's Robin Williams. He does a fantastic job.
He really is full of emotion in that movie.
What would be your favorite Disney movie?
I really liked Beauty and the Beast.
I hope I can get to see the new version of that movie that isn't a cartoon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that new Cars movie? From what I heard it is pretty awesome.
Yes, we have watched all three now. It is actually one of a few animated pictures that has three parts to it.
How was it?
My daughter liked it a lot. Especially, that new character Cruz Ramirez.
What is that character?
It is a mechanic car that helps the main character, McQueen, to train for the race.
OK, don't spoil it for me. I think I am going to watch together with my family.
It is a great movie, I would go for a part four if they decide to shoot it.
Yeah, I will order it on demand tonight. Thanks, buddy!
You are welcome! Enjoy your movie tonight!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast.
Not yet, what did you think?
Personally, I liked the old one, the animated one, better.
Really? Doesn't Emma Watson play the live version Belle?
Yeah, I don't know. I didn't feel the same magic.
Well what was different about it?
I'm just used to the animation like I said, also the music sounded completely different.
Well I know Emma Watson sang in the movie as Belle.
Yeah, I just don't think she's that good to be honest.
Well luckily we can always watch the animated version.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm babysitting tonight. Whats a good Disney Movie
Is it a little girl or boy?
A little girl
Then I recommend The Little Mermaid
I've never seen it, what's it about?
It's about a mermaid who gives up her voice in exchange to be a human
Wow, what a great plot. Whats the year on it
1989
Isn't that a bit old?
It's getting up there in age, but it's a classic for all ages
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you ever watch dumbo?
no i did not, is that a disney movie?
yeah it is the one with the little elephant
oh yeah that sounds familar, what was special with him?
well he had big ears that i think he used to get made fun of for
oh really, that isnt nice
yeah but he could fly with them since they were so big
oh thats so cool i wish i could fly
just watch the movie dumbo again and do what he did
i dont think it works like that but ill watch it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Disney movies?
Who doesn't.
I like Beauty and the Beast.
I love the new live one with Emma Watson.
Beauty and the Beast had amazing songs.
Tale as old as time.
I also like The Little Mermaid.
I could probably quote it from memory.
Have you seen Moana?
Not yet but I want to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tron was such a disappointing movie.
They put huge marketing dollars behind it too.
I think Jeff Bridges was the only big name actor they used.
Even he had a tough time with the acting.
Thats kind of crazy he has such a good career.
I think the visual effects were boring as well.
The story all in all was a bit weak.
I think that the whole digital world concept is tired.
Yeah I would agree with you on that.
And it didnt have a plot beyond what they had written. No development of any characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch the Aristocats?
I loved that movie as a kid.
Which was your favorite cat.
Duh, O'malley the alley cat?
Same here, he was so cool.
I watched it for the song they sang in the abandoned building.
Well, everybody wants to be a cat.
I certainly did.
That butler was messed up, trying to get rid of those cute little darlings.
I was so happy when everything turned out for the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The jazz music in the movie The Incredibles was great.
Yeah, the whole motif of the movie was that jazz music.
Did you like that character Frozone?
Oh absolutely. He was funny.
I think the movie did a great job of capturing everyday life of working people as well.
Yeah. Bob Parr was not liking his life till he got back in action.
It looked like their whole family was in need to get back in action.
You're totally right. I loved how that little lady Edna made the new suits.
She's so funny!
She reminds me of my grandmother! Haha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The kids and I finally got around to seeing Moana this weekend.
Oh yeah, what did you think?
It was OK. I was hoping for more. Especially with the Rock in it. Maybe it's just because my boys weren't that into it.
Maybe they will like Cars 3 more.
Oh, yeah. We are excited to see that one. Planes was a disappointment though.
I don't actually think we saw that one.
I heard they are making an Incredibles 2.
Me too! But I've been hearing that for a while now.
Yeah, I wonder why they haven't yet.
Me too, it was such a good one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever have to watch Disney movies in elementary school?
Every time the teacher was absent, yeah.
My favorite was always The Lion King.
Really? Personally, I was always partial to Hercules.
That one had a great theme song, but I didn't like the plot.
But the way Hades and Meg interact is so funny!
Okay, I'll give you that one. But The Lion King is timeless.
You're right, even the soundtrack is timeless.
You can't ever go wrong with Elton John.
He should do the next Disney soundtrack!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Toy Story is one of my favorites animated movies ever.
The fourth part will be released in June 2019
I didn't know that.  How do you know about it?
I saw it on Facebook last week.
It is official?
I do not know yet. But if you want I will send you the link where I saw it.
If It is true I hope Tom Hanks and Tim Allen will be together again in this franchise.
They should. Their voices have been very symbolic in all the movies.
Also Rex's voice it's one of the best. Who is that actor?
He's Wallace Shawn. He worked in "The incredibles" too as "Mr. Huph", the Bob's boss.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts about the remake of Beauty and the Beast that came out this year?
I thought Emma Watson was a great choice for Belle!
Same.  I thought she did a great job with the singing.
I wonder if they considered anyone else for the role?
I'm not sure if they did or not.
At first, I was worried she'd seem a little too young to play Belle, even though she's in her 20s.
That's true!  But Belle is pretty young in the animated version, so I think Emma was a good choice.
What about the Beast though!  Them together didn't work all that will in my opinion.
Right?!  He seemed so much older than her!
Agreed.  It was kind of awkward at the end when he turns back into the prince because he looks like he's probably 15 years older than her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have your kids watched all of the Disney Classics like, Snow White, Fantasia, or Bambi?
They've watched a few but not all, the kids don't care for the graphics because they're not like todays movies.
What's the last movie they watched from Disney?
Aladdin and they loved it.
I just watched Alice in wonderland and they loved it, I think the fact that theres a lot of singing in it.
I should try and watch that with them, I think they would compare it to the remake.
Let's make a movie night and watch PInnochio or Jungle Book with them.
That sounds great! we could make a night of it Jungle book is actually quite funny especially the monkey king.
Perfect and then next weekend we could watch Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.
Sleeping Beauty is my ultimate favorite Disney Movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you grow up on Disney movies?
Sure. I'm from the olden time when there were no movies on video or DVD, so the only way to see a movie was in theaters.
Yeah, going to the movies was a much bigger deal back then, more special.
I grew up in a big family, so we hardly ever went to walk-in theaters, too expensive. We did the drive-in movie thing.
I'm from that time also. I think I saw every Disney movie there was, in a drive in theater.
I remember we would make tons of popcorn, put it in paper shopping bags (remember those?) and take them to the drive in to munch on during the movie.
Do you remember any particular movie experience?
There was this live-action movie, In Search of the Castaways, from 1962. I went with my best friend, and my sis and her bestie.
I think I remember that one. Maurice Chevalier was in it.
I liked it because my mom always told me I looked like Hayley Mills when I was a little girl. So it's one of my favorite Disney movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
the goofy movie was funny
I liked how his son and him had one last road trip
I know but Goofy really is silly
he is I can imagine a kid being embarassed of a dad that acts like that
seriously though, he was embarrassing at some points
he means well though he loved his son
he did  that is true and in the end he knew it
I wish I could go on a road trip like that
I have been on one and it was fun, not with my parents though
no I would rather go with friends
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a fovorite Disney movie from the Disney Renaissance?
Which movies were part of the Renaissance era again?
The Little Mermaid, The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Mulan, and Tarzan.
Beauty and the Beast was probably my favorite, but they're all such good movies. No wonder it's called the Disney Renaissance!
I liked Beauty and the Beast too! I always wanted to be Bell.
My favorite thing about the movie was the songs.
Which song is your favorite?
Oh, same as everybody, Be Our Guest. How about you?
It's hard to choose a favorite but I always liked the first song Belle sings about her little town.
Yeah, all the songs are great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I going to Disney World for vacation, but I haven't seen any of the movies.
Well you certainly can't watch all of them now.  You'll never finish.
Which one should I watch first?
Well, if you are going to Disney World, I would watch CInderella.
Why is that?
Well, Her castle is in the middle of the park.
I guess it is also a pretty famous one.
It is a classic.  It has a beautiful story, and the music is amazing.
Isn't that where "A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes" is from?
That's right.  It is a beautiful song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?
No, how is it?
It was really fun.
What did you like about it?
I really liked that it was live action.
Why?
It made the characters seem so much more real.
Which ones in particular?
Beast especially, and Mrs. Potts
That's really interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Probably 'Aladdin', although it's really tough to choose. You?
I love 'Aladdin' but I'd probably pick 'Fantasia'.
Is that the really older one?
Yeah, it's from the 40s or 50s. No dialog, just animation.
I think I've seen clips from it and it's amazing.
It is, and it's really cool to see early Disney animation and see how it progressed.
Disney really found its own style early on, didn't it?
For sure, and that's part of the reason Disney is so successful.
Everyone grew up with Disney. It's like a family tradition.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the movie BFG? It's a Disney movie.
Yes! Oh my gosh, I absolutely loved it!
Really? I haven't had the chance to see it yet. What did you enjoy about it?
I loved how BFG, which stands for Big Friendly Giant, by the way, would sneak through town without being seen by anyone.
What's so great about that? I don't understand.
Well he was huge, for starters. Taller than most buildings.
How did he avoid being seen then? I'm trying to picture it.
He would kind of morph into some of the things he would be standing by or be near. A lamp post, for example.
Oh how cool! Now I'm curious to see it.
You really should! It was a really fun movie and it had a great storyline.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie yet?
No! Don't spoil it for me!
I won't, but Johnny Depp was so good as Captain Jack.
I'm sure he was! I'm sad it's the last movie in the series.
I know, I really like those movies.
I haven't seen a longer running movie series by Disney in a long time.
What about Star Wars?
That doesn't count. That recently became Disney and they made all those movies before that.
That's true. Well maybe they will find something else to continue.
Well some movies you can only go so far without ruining it completely, so we will see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't get how they are going to make a live action Lion King Movie.
I assume it will be kind of like the Jungle Book.
But there weren't any people in the Lion King so how will any of it be live action?
Most of the Jungle Book was CGI, so I guess all of the movie will be CGI.
It should just be considered an animated movie then.
I do love that they are bringing back James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa.
And Donald Glover will be Simba!
I don't think I know who any of the other characters are or if they have even been cast yet.
It should be interesting, hopefully it goes well.
I wonder what they will do with the music in this one. Maybe they will update it a little bit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast live-action movie?
No, I haven't seen the live action version, but I love the original animated version.
Me too. But my all-time favorite Disney movie is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Oh, yeah. That movie is a classic.
I was terrified of the evil queen when I was a kid!
Me too. I was also afraid of Ursula from The Little Mermaid.
Yeah, I thought she was pretty scary, too. What did you think of the stepmother from Cinderella?
The stepmother was mean. So were the stepsisters. But they weren't very scary.
I liked the Cinderella sequels where the one stepsister married the baker. She wasn't so mean after all.
She was just looking for love.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's been such a long time since I saw Toy Story!
Oh yeah, I know right? I love that movie.
Who was the one who wrote the music for that movie?
I think it was Randy Newman.
Oh yeah that sounds familiar.
Do you like a certain song in that movie or something?
Yeah. I really like "You've got a friend in me."
Oh yeah that's a great song.
Which songs do you like from Toy Story?
I really like that song when Buzz tries to fly. It's a good song, but kind of sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you have Disney movies and Dvd's when you were a kid?
Of course, lots of them, both VHS and DVD.
My favorite were
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is The Fox and the Hound good?
Yes
I love the old woman
Yeah but it is sad when she parts with the fox
That badger was really funny
Yeah. He was very grumpy
I liked all the characters
I am glad the hunter got what was coming to him
Yeah, I'm glad he learned his lesson
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you thunk about the movie tangled
I love that movie
I cant believe she was locked in that huge tower
She was a very clever girl
I loved the art where she used the frying pan
Yeah she used it in Flynn ryder
He had a soft spot for her
The witch was very manipulative in that movie
I totally agree
The song in the bar was awesome also
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the third Toy Story.
No, but I have seen the first two.
You should see it. I think it's my favorite out of the three.
Oh really? I loved the first two. Woody and Buz are my favorite characters.
Ya three seemed like it had a great message for adults about how fast life goes.
Oh man that does sound interesting. I know Andy is getting older and going away to college.
Ya and then all the toys have to deal with that where they don't know what is going to happen to them.
Thanks for reminding me of that I guess I will have to watch it.
I think if you loved Toy Story and Toy Store two you would really like it.
Didn't they kind of deal with that in two with Jessy feeling sad about loosing the girl she had been with?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Alice in Wonderland was such a strange movie.
I agree, especially since it came out so long ago.
That caterpillar was just insane.
Yeah, he really got mad at Alice at one point.
There were so many parts in that movie that scared me.
That queen and the Mad Hatter were pretty terrifying.
Didn't the whole movie end up being a dream in the end though?
I think so, but I haven't seen it in so long I can't remember.
We should watch it again soon to see if it's still scary.
Okay, but don't blame me if you can't sleep that night!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what the first cartoon Disney movie ever was?
Let's see. Was it Bambi?
Close. It was actually Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Oh, right. That's based on some sort of fairy tale, isn't it?
Yes. It was a fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm.
Can you name all of the dwarfs?
Let's see. Dopey, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Doc and Bashful.
Nice. That movie is such a classic.
Even people who have never seen it probably know about the seven dwarfs or the song "Heigh-ho".
Yes. That one, and "Whistle While You Work".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen disney's rescuers down under?
Yes, I feel like it is often forgotten about completely.
I was going to say that, funny.
I love the mouse that reminds of zsa zsa gabor.
I think she may have voiced that role, no?
That would make sense so much alike.
Or rather one in the same. I liked the kangaroo.
He was a good guy. The seagull was really funny too.
Interesting disney uses seagulls in that way in The little mermaid too!
Never thought of that before, but true scuttle is also very funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just found out they're making a sequel!
Oh that's gonna be dope. I love that movie!
Me too. I feel like it was really underrated.
I wonder what the plot is going to be?
From what I understand, they start exploring the internet.
The whole video game world is full potential. There are a ton of fun ideas to play with in that mythology.
I agree, Wreck It Ralph was actually one of the few animated films that I felt really lent itself to the possibility of sequels.
I wonder if eventually he'll evolve like Donkey Kong did?
What do you mean?
Think of how Donkey Kong was essentially the villain in the begining, but eventually everything changed and he got his own set of games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Cars 3 movie?
Not yet, have you?
Yes, we went the first day it came out! I think they get better and better each movie.
Really? Did they have the same characters in this one?
Yes, all the same characters Mater, Sally, Mack, and more.
Great I love Mater he is one of my favorite characters!
I know I think the actor Larry the Cable Guy who plays him does a great job.
I do too he really makes Mater believable and funny.
I definitely recommend going and seeing it because it had some great comedic moments and a great story line.
Cool, I'll see about taking the kids this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There's something about Aladdin that is just so charming.
Truly one of the best Disney movies, no contest.
I love Aladdin and Jasmin as characters and the animation is so great.
Really good setting for a film too, we don't get many of those.
Agreed, especially in a children's animation.
Jafar is one of my favorite villains, so sinister looking.
Indeed, the movie has a great balance of characters.
Yeah and we're even forgetting the best of all, can you guess it?
The genie, man, how can I not guess it?
We should totally watch Aladdin this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you thing Disney will make a live version of another movie?
Yes, since the of Beauty and the Beast, I think they will make several live versions.
What movie do you want to see a live version of?
Well, Cinderella is played out.  But I wouldn't mind seen a live version of that mermaid girl.
A live version of Ariel would be perfect.
Yes, it would have wonderful graphics and lots of action.
What do you think will be the best part of the movie?
The underwater scenes will be the most action filled.
Do you think any parts will be scary?
No, only intense scenes.  The second best part will the the fight on the ship.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what was the weirdest Disney movie?
Oh definitely Pinocchio.
What's your case?
Well, Geppetto. Why does he want a real boy so terribly bad - that's a bid odd.
Very true. What else.
Well, the fact that a cricket was enlisted to be the conscience for the puppet.
Yeah, who ever came up with that?
Heh someone highly imaginative.
Clearly. I'd say it was a good film though - one of the classics.
No doubt. It just had some bizarre elements.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Moana is on Netflix?!
Yes!! We already watched it twice with week!
My kids love that movie.
Same! I wonder if Disney will do a Moana ride.
That would be so cute! They could have Moana's journey with Moui.
I have to say Hei Hei was one of my favorite side kick characters.
I loved the songs !
Me too! Our schoo sung them for three spring show!
Now I need to go rewatch the movie for the umpteenth time!
Enjoy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Bob, wanna check ou that new Star Wars movie?
When did you have in mind?
Friday.  9 pm showing at the Cardinal on 5th and main.
Sure.  I hear it's another great addition to the series.
The trailers are enticing to me.
I love the action in every Star Wars!
can we go early and get some nachos?
Yeah,  That's a given.
Can I wear my storm trooper outfit
In that case just meet me there, get your ticket and grab a seat.  I'll find you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could become a part of a Disney movie, which would you pick?
All of them!
Okay, okay. But if you had to narrow it down?
Let's see...probably Pirates of the Caribbean.
Pirates, totally!
Exactly! Who wouldn't want to be an awesome pirate?
Would you want to sail with Jack Sparrow?
Oh yeah. That would be so entertaining!
Have you seen the new Pirates movie yet?
Nope, but have plans to see it this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like finding nemo
It was cute, my kids loved it
Same here, what about finding dory?
Ive only seen pieces of it, i want to see the whole thing.
It was really good.
It looked good from what I saw
It took a long time to come out.
It did, but it was worth it.
Yes it was
Thanks for talking to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Disney is making more live action movies?
Yes, I heard that.  Do you know which ones?
I don't know all of them, but I read that they are remaking The Little Mermaid and Mulan, a couple of my favorites.
I am looking forward to seeing those.
Yes, I saw the remake of Cinderella a couple of years ago with Lily James.  She made such a perfect Cinderella.
I saw it too.  The computer generated special effects were stunning.
Yes, I thought so too.  The scenes with the pumpkin coach and mice footmen were spectacular.
I really enjoyed watching Cinderella magically change into the ballgown. It looked so real.
Yes, that was beautiful.  I'm excited to see how the new ones turn out.
So am I.  I expect they will be very well done like most Disney movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see pirest of the carebiyan 4th part.
Yah.. but nothing interesting in this.
Yeh man. This is a boring movie
Well, jon deep well played in hi character but all was noting
I think that " the first part was this movie series", is the best part.
Yah. I also like well the first part.
Well, think that " series movies are not good after first part",
Yes you are ri8.
Ok, let's wait.. i hope we will see the next part of this movie.
But i don't  this that " it could be happen".
XXXXXXXXXXX
That Hunchback of Notre Dame movies was insane, but in a good way!
I remember that movies, I was also so scared to watch it when I was older.
Same here! I watched it again recently and was amazed by the animations and songs.
There was music in this film? I guess I was really scared.
Yah there's this song called Hellfire in it, it might be Disney's greatest song.
Are you sure. Better than Circle of Life, Tales as Old as Time, or Let it Go.
Well anything is better than Let it Go but it is definitely up there,
I guess I will give it shot. I have heard similiar things from other people so it must be true.
I swear you will love it! The music is the greatest and it does stay true to the source material.
Fine! Your already convince me! I think it is on Netflix or something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched the classic Disney movie, Fantasia?
No. I've heard of it though. Isn't it about a vampire bar?
HaHa. No. You are thinking of a television series that is no longer showing.
Well, tell me about the movie, Fantasia, then.
Oh gosh, I can't remember what year it was actually made, but it is completely antimated.
Was it made before we were born?
Uh, yes, we're not that old. (Laughing)
Speak for yourself. haha
It's just incredibly amazing. It must have taken the cartoonists literally years to finish it.
You mean every scene, every illustration in the movie was hand drawn by the artists? Wow!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?
Yes! It was incredible!
I know. I loved Emma Watson in it.
Yes, so did I. She really made it special.
Yeah she did. I have heard a lot of people complain about the computer-generated animation though.
Really? I thought it was great.
Yeah. Mainly in the scene with the wolves.
Oh okay. I do remember then looking fake but I didn't really mind.
Yeah. I think it was still such a good story line.
I'm glad they came out with it. Beauty and the Beast is my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the Disney movie "The Little Mermaid?"
Oh, yeah. It's a classic. It was one of my favorites as a kid.
Me, too. My favorite character was Ariel. She sang beautifully.
I liked Ariel too, but my favorite character was Flounder.
He was really cute. He always got so scared in the different scenes.
What did you think of the crab?
You mean, Sebastian? He was a cute character. He had a great accent.
One of my favorite characters was Scuttle the seagull.
I know. He was really funny, right?
I thought he was kind of on the dingy side. But, it made the movie comical.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I really love The Little Mermaid.
Oh, I grew up watching that! I love the music.
Me too, I still know all the words to Under the Sea.
I used to think I was a mermaid like Ariel. Do you like other Disney movies from the time?
I think so -- like Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, or Aladdin?
I don't care for Aladdin, but I really liked Beauty and the Beast.
Yes, I think Beauty and the Beast is great. Have to seen the remake?
No, I haven't. But I plan to when it comes out on DVD.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Finding Dory?
Yes, I took my kids to see it last week.
Did you like it?
I loved it! I think that it was as good as Finding Nemo. Maybe better.
That is a very bold assessment. Finding Nemo is a classic.
Well, the story was very sweet and heart warming. Ellen as Dory is the best thing in the world.
I had heard that from other friends. Is it a tear jerker?
Yes, but more over it was very funny.
Would you recommend Finding Dory for me then?
Yes. I would go so far as to say buying the bluray is worth the cost.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you cry when you watched Bambi?
No the movies never touch me like that
But the scene where her mother gets shot.
Yeah it as heart wrenching.
I cant believe you didnt show any emotion.
Disney always does a good job at almost getting me there.
The character of Thumper was also very good
I think it was very cute
But Bambi was the ultimate feel good story
You loved to see Bambi triumphant in the end
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Cinderella, by far.
Why Cinderella?
I can relate to the whole wicked step mother thing.
Your step mom was evil and wanted to see you fail?
Something like that.
Do you at least get a charming prince out of it?
Not at all.
I guess it could have been worse.
Not really. I really did have to sweep chimneys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite film series produced by Disney is The Pirates of the Caribbean.
The film series was an instant classic.
With a cast line up including Johnny Depp, it was hard not to go wrong.
The cast also included Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.
How could I forget the actors who played Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan?
I liked seeing Orlando Bloom act opposite Johnny Depp. For most of the first film, Elizabeth Swan was on her own.
The movie is so quotable.
I quote the movie more often than not.
Captain Jack Sparrow's lines are some of my favorite, especially his quote about rum.
My favorite line is when he is arrested and claims they have heard of him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any Disney movies that you didn't like?
I tried to watch Alice in Wonderland, but it was weird.
Yeah, I didn't even understand the birthday scene with the Mad Hatter.
Oh, you mean the unbirthday scene?
Yeah, see that didn't make sense to me.
What about the dancing cards?
Well, that song was catchy at least, not sure what they were supposed to be doing though.
I did kind of like the Cheshire Cat?
Wasn't he the one with the glowing eyes, that would disappear?
Yeah he was, he was creepy, but I still kind of liked him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Chicken Little was just an okay movie. Did you ever see that one?
Yes. You are right though.
I mean it had cute characters but the whole boy who cried wolf story. I don't know.
I know.
I didn't recognize any of the voices except for Joan Cusack.
I didn't even know she was in it.
I'm sure there were other stars we'd know, but I couldn't tell.
Did your kids like the movie?
Well they watched it, but not over and over.
Well then I guess they agree with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The Little Mermaid?
I have. I went to see it when I was living overseas. It was huge over there as well.
I adore the music.
Under the Sea!!!!! Yes!
I had a friend who had trouble seeing, She went to the eye doctor and got glasses. She went around singing A Whole New World
Why?
Because she could finally see so it was truly a whole new world for her.
Oh, OK. That's cute.
We should have a Disney movie night some time at my house.
I'll be there!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched The Lion King with the grandchildren the other night and I cried like a baby.
I know when his father died it was so sad. My husband said he cried when he saw Old Yeller
Oh my that is an old one. That was made in the late 1950's and it stars Tommy Kirk, Dorothy McGuire and Beverly Washburn.
How do you remember that?
I have watched it twenty times we have it on tape.
Do you have Aladdin? I would like to watch that one again.
Yes, I will loan it to you. It will make you miss Robin Williams.
I forgot he was the genie. My grandchildren would really enjoy watching it.
Better watch out they will be rubbing every vase in your house trying to rub out the genie.
Sounds like a good way to get the knick knacks dusted.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you a big Disney fan?
I'd say so. Why do you ask?
I was just wondering. What's your favorite Disney movie?
Frozen all the way!
That's a good one. Who is your favorite character?
Olaf! Yours?
Olaf is pretty great, but I think my favorite is Kristoff.
Oh I love him. He's definitely better than Hans.
I can't believe how evil Hans was!
You are so right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movie would you say is the saddest?
The one that has made me cry the most is Fox and the Hound
Really? Isn't that just a cute animal movie
Well yeah, but there are some really sad scenes in it
Like what?
When the main woman character has to drop off Todd the fox in the forest, I always tear up
Yeah but I can think of a sadder movie, like Dumbo or Bambi
I can understand Bambi being sad...but Dumbo?
That scene where the mother elephant  gets separated from her baby always gets me
I'v heard that a lot of mothers find that scene touching as well
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think there will ever be a Toy Story 4?
I haven't heard of that, but it might be a good idea.
The Disney Toy Story movies are my favorite.
I think Toy Story 3 was better than the first 2.
I agree, each Toy Story movie seems to be better than the last.  That doesn't happen often with sequels.
My favorite part of of the movie was the Barbie & Ken characters.
I know, that was hilarious!  I had that same barbie doll as a child.
Yes, the barbie wearing the blue workout clothes & leg warmers!  That was so 1980's!
That movie definitely brought back memories!  I recognized a lot of the toys.
Yes it was a cute movie, and I'm glad it had a happy ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever noticed in Disney films at least one parent is dead.
Not in all of them.
Which ones have both parents.
Mulan, Sleeping Beauty and Tangled, to start.
But in Tangled she was not raised by her parents, just the evil witch lady.
But, they were still alive and she met them later.
That is the same plot, sort of, with Sleeping Beauty?
Yes, her parents did not get to raise her.
Who did?
The fairies, to keep her safe from touching the spindle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I love Beauty and the Beast.
Did you see the live version yet?
No, not yet.
It did really well in theaters.
I saw that. I am waiting till it comes on demand or Netflix.
Why are you waiting?
I am not sure that I will be happy with a live version and I didn't want to spend the money.
That is understandable.
If it is as good as the live Jungle Book was, then I will like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Every time I watch The Fox and The Hound I cry.
I cry every time I watch Bambi.
They are both such sad Disney movies.
Let's talk about some happy movies.
Okay. Alice in Wonderland always manages to lift my spirits.
I like when the White Rabbit is running late. That scene always makes me laugh.
I like when the Flowers call Alice a weed, and she is so offended.
I know. The way the Flower says it so matter of factly is what makes it so funny.
My other favorite part has got to be the mad tea party.
The Mad Hatter is so funny. He is my favorite character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know they are making Toy Story 4?
What did not know that!
Yes, and Don Rickles who played Mr. Potato Head just died.
Oh no. That is sad. What will they do?
Luckily all the voice work was already completed.
That is good but still sad that he died.
Yes. I wonder what the story line will be though?
I do too. Maybe it will focus on the toys in their new home.
It would be really sad if they show the girl that Andy gave the toys to grow up and not want to play with them also.
Don't be silly. They wouldn't do that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new live action Beauty and the Beast movie yet?
No, I haven't, have you?
No, but I'm dying to go.
Me too.  I think they did such a good job picking Emma Watson to portray Belle.
I agree.  She really looked the part from the advertisements.
I wonder how they did Beast?
I'm not sure, but I bet it required a lot of make up and CGI.
Speaking of CGI, I heard the servants are great also.
Yeah, I can't wait to see the "Be Our Guest" scene.
Do you think they have the original songs?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you name every one of the dwarfs from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?
Of course I can. Doc, Dopey, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful, and Grumpy!
Hey you have a really good memory. I always forget at least one of them.
Well it's one of my favorite Disney movies. "Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"
Did you just quote the Evil Queen?
You know I did! I was so scared of her when I was little.
Especially when she was disguised as the old lady.
Yeah Snow White was a very nice person because I'm not sure I would have helped her.
Well if she ever learned not to talk to strangers then it wouldn't have been a problem.
I'm not sure she had the best parental guidance since she was living with 7 kind dwarfs out in a cabin after her stepmother tried to have her killed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Fox and the Hound is a great movie.
I agree with you. I like the old Disney cartoons way better than the newer ones.
The movie is so sad, but so nice at the same time.
Yeah, the way Copper and Todd are torn apart by Copper's owner is so sad. I cried!
I liked the song that the birds sang with the owl in that movie.
"Lack of Education!" Haha.
Do you know when that movie was made?
I'm not really sure. Probably back in the 1990s or something.
Yeah you're probably right.
I think Flubber came out around the same time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Toy Story Three is the best movie of all time.
I know right! It had so many good elements!
It is actually the third-highest-grossing animated film of all time.
Wow! I did not know that, but I can see why.
I really like Woody.
Why?
Because he's an effective leader, he keeps everyone together. He has his flaws, but the movies allow him to grow past them.
That's true, I never thought of it that way.
Hey, when did that movie come out?
Um, I think around 2010.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think i might rent a movie.
I've been watching a lot lately with all this heat.
Was the new Star Wars movie good?
I don't know, I didn't see it.
I've never seen one.
You're not missing that much. I have tried, but i just can't get into it.
You didn't like any of them?
Not really. I thought Princess Lea was cool, though.
Yeah, I kind of want to see Carrie Fisher.
You should watch it and tell me how it is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Toy Story movies?
I have seen them all. The third one was my favorite.
I liked the third one the best, too.
The baby doll with the half open eye creeped me out.
Same here, but I liked that he turned on Lottso at the end.
Did you think the fire scene at the dump was too scary for kids?
A little bit. But I liked how the toys all held hands and came together as one.
Bonnie was by far my favorite character. She is so cute!
I agree! So glad Andy picked her to keep all of his toys.
Me too. It was a beautiful ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Brave?
That's the one with the red-headed princess, right?
Yeah, Merida.  That's the one.
Yeah, I did.  I liked it.
I did too.  I really liked that Merida was strong and independent.
Yeah, she was really independent.  She was also stubborn and that got her into a bit of trouble.
True.  She shouldn't have gone to the witch to get help with her mother.  She should have just kept trying to make her mother see her point of view.
But she tried to get her mother to understand and she just wouldn't.  She had no choice but to go to the witch.
I don't know.  At least she figured out how to fixed the curse and turn her mother back into a human.
And don't forget her brothers because they'd turned into bears too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Snow White ever forgot any of the dwarves names?
Maybe at first. But they are all pretty specific.
There were seven dwarves right?
Yes and they all were named after different attributes.
Name all of the dwarves then.
Dopey, Sleepy, Grumpy, Bashful, Happy...
Can't think of the other two can you?
I can! They're on the tip of my tongue!
Doc and Sneezy!
I can't believe I forgot! I'm such a Dopey.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Disney is making a new The Lion King movie?
Really? When is it coming out?
It's set to release around July 2019. And it will be a live-action movie.
Just like Beauty and the Beast?
I guess so. Maybe a musical, maybe not. Im fascinated by it. Knowing Disney, it will be amazing.
I know it will. I just wonder how they will do it and incorporate the animals. Timon and Pumbaa are my favorites.
The studio will find a way. An I bet it will also be 3D, it will help it come alive.
I just can imagine how amazing the effects and graphics will be.
No doubt it will be a must see movie.
I will mark my calendar. I won't miss it for the world
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Tarzan cartoon?
The one by Disney?
Yeah, that one.
It was okay.  I just didn't think that it was one of their best.
Really?  I loved it.
Well, it came out just a couple years after Hercules.  Hercules was much better.
Yeah, I liked Hercules a lot better.
I mean, the popularity from Hercules still wasn't up when they released Tarzan.
Still, Tarzan was a totally different story.
Yeah, you're right.  It was much more heartwarming.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie the Parent Trap?
No I have not, was it it about?
It´s very cool is about this two sister that did not know each other and met at camp.
Really, how is that possible?
They were separated at birth, they are identical twins.
That´s crazy!, why is it called the Parent Trap?
Because they trick their parents to love each other again.
Does it work?
Oh it does! They get married. Do you think you´ll like to see it?
Count me inn! I heard that they have a newer version also.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow, I just watched Tarzan. What a great movie!
You're going to have to be more specific. There's like at least a dozen different movie versions of Tarzan.
I'm talking about the animated Disney version from the 90s.
Oh that one. It was alright, I couldn't get over the gorilla with the Brooklyn accent though.
Are you talking about Terk? I loved him in that movie!
I think you mean "her."
Wait, Terk was a girl? How do you know?
Yes, it was obvious if you were actually paying attention. Disney even got Rosie O'Donnell to voice her.
I had no idea. I'm going to go re-watch it again, I probably missed some other obvious stuff.
Yea, have fun with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wasn't there going to be a Lion King sequel?
There were some sequels.
That's funny, I never saw them in the theater.
They were released straight to DVD.
Oh, I see.  Are they worth watching?
Not really.  They are just kind of standalone movies.
Is Scar in them?
No, he died in the original.  Remember, the hyenas did him in?
I do now.  Sad, really, he was a great villain.
He was a murderer.  He deserved what he got.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When I was a kid I remember going to see Lady and the Tramp.
Oh, that's a favorite Disney movie of mine!
I loved the opposites attract story line. So romantic.
Yeah, it's funny that an animated dog can be more romantic than the men I date!
Too true!
I also loved Peggy Lee singing the the iconic He's A Tramp.
Maybe that movie is why every man I've gone out with was also totally opposite of me.
Your love life was inspired by an animated dog?
Hey, there are far worse blueprints to follow!
That is true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Hunchback of Notre Dame?
Yes. I am a big fan of it too.
I saw it in theaters. It is a good Disney movie.
Do you think it's as good as the greats like Aladdin.
It's not as good as Aladdin, but it is good.
The animated films got a little worse after The Lion King.
I agree. I did not like Pocahontas that much.
Did you like Mulan?
Not really. I did not like Tarzan either.
Yeah, the classics like Lion King and Aladdin and The Little Mermaid are the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I agree, the songs became very catchy!
Have you been on the Frozen ride in Disney?
Yes! We loved it, well worth the wait!
You are right, with the songs and the ride I don't think anyone will forget Ana and Elsa.
Don't forget the Clothing and the Dolls!!
Of course not!
Which one does your daughter relate to more? Sammy loves Ana
So funny! Kinz loves Elsa.
I wonder what Frozen 2 will be about?
Maybe their children.....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like disney movies
Yes i love them
Me too
They are great for families
Exactly
I love watching movies like frozen with my kids
And tangled
Yes those are great movies
My kids always talk me into buying them
Same here
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what's your favorite Disney song?
I don't know, there are so many. How about you?
Well, since you asked; I would have to say the entire soundtrack of "The Little Mermaid!"
Well, you said which "song". Not which soundtrack. Just reminding you.
Okay, well then; I liked "Part of Your World"  best.  She was so sad down beneath the sea with her collection of sunken treasures.
Your right.  Maybe too sad for me though. I liked " Under the Sea".  Sebastian and all of the other sea creatures were jamming out.
Yeah, but Sebastian was too worried all of the time.
That's because Ariel was such a rebel.
You're right. That's why I like her.  She reminds me of , well, me!
You wish!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Cinderella is probably my favorite Disney movie, what do you think?
I love that movie, I like when the pumpkin was turned into a carriage.
I liked the part when the yugly stepsisters could not fit their big ugly feet into the little glass slipper.
what about when the birds helped make the dress?
I know that part was amazing, I wish birds would help me sew some clothes!
How did her father die, I saw that he drove off but I wondered how he died.
I think he had a heart attack and that is how she ended up with her evil stepmother.
I wish she could have stayed longer than midnight, I hated it when the spell broke
I know, she looked so pretty and then had to go back to her sad life
I hated how they treated her and loved that she lost that slipper, he found her !
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever feel bad for the villains in disney?
Yes, sometimes.
I feel like some of them got a little more than they deserved.
Like Facillier being dragged to the underworld.
Yea, but what if he was left to keep doing all of his dark magic-
That would have been a little problematic.
True, but the underworld?!
I don't know if he would have reformed though.
I don't know he may have been scared into reformity.
Being threatened by evil spirits can definitely do that to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched Moana last night!
You did?  What did you think?
I really, really liked it.  I think she might be my new favorite Disney princess.
I like her too!
She is strong and determined.
I also like that there wasn't a love story.
Yeah, it seems like most of the Disney princesses are mostly focused on love.
Exactly!  Moana doesn't need a prince.
My daughter really like Maui too.
I didn't care for him at first but liked him by the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the best Disney movies
I love when Tim Burton teams up with Disney
right? they always do good things!
i love seeing what he comes up with in his new, creepy world
jack and sally are weirdly relationship goals
they are! i love their little song at the end
it's the best halloween movie, and it doubles as a christmas movie! does it get any better?
it doesn't.
oogie boogie's song is the best song from the whole flick, though
villains always steal the spotlight
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Cool Runnings today , such a good movie
I forgot about that !
I watched it when I was younger, it is so funny
I know , I used to want to bobsled
same here, once my brother and I made a trail with our sleds in the snow
what did you do with the sleds?
we would run and jump in them and pretend to bobsled
The Olympics were so much fun when we were kids
I know, because you could imagine what you would do
That is true, I wanted to figure skate
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't watch "Ratatouille" anymore.
Why not? Did you not like it?
No, on the contrary it was awesome.
Then, what's the problem?
To be frank the movie makes me hungry.
That's hilarious, man.
It is not! The movie makes me hungry, that rat can cook!
Never have I ever heard a weirder sentence. "That rat can cook..."
He can! I would eat that food it looks so good.
I don't know if I would eat what a rat cooked but it the food did look good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I heard something yesterday, not sure if it's true.
Okay, explain more.
They are apparently remaking Peter Pan.
But they've remade that film tons of times already!
I know, but this one is actually being done by Disney.
Live-action or animation?
Live-action.  It will be totally different from the other recent Peter Pan movies.
Wow.  They are really re-doing everything, aren't they?
Well, the movies are popular and make tons of money.
I guess that's my answer as to why!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you taken your kids to see the new Cars 3 movie?
No not yet! Have you taken your kids?
Yes! It was such a good movie! All the original characters are back. McQueen, Mater, Sally, Luigi, Guido, Mack, Red.
Oh that is awesome! The second Cars just wasn't that great and all the original characters weren't in it.
I know! I had reall high hopes for the Cars 3 and it didn't disappoint! I'm thinking of taking my kids a second time. In this one, McQueen is the old racer who is having trouble keeping up with the new, faster race cars.
Oh it was that good huh? Well looks like I need to get my kids to the theater soon! That sounds like a good story line!
Yes maybe we can take our kids together! When are you free?
Oh my kids would love that! Let me look at my calendar and get back to you.
Sounds great! Looking forward to it!
I'm preparing myself for all the Cars 3 items my kids will want me to buy after the movie, haha!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I gotta catch up
Catch up?
Yeah on DIsney movies
How so
Well i have not watch any of their stuff in awhile
What did you miss
Most of their big releases last year
Well i can get some
Can you?
Would be awesome
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello
Whats up
Not much
Same Same
Wanna do something
Sure
We can watch some old Mickey Mouse movies
Sounds fun
I got all the old ones
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Jungle Book?
I remember seeing the original one back when I was a kid.
Yeah, I never liked that one as a kid. The monkey characters kind of freaked me out.
I thought Baloo's character was kind of fun.
Yes, he had a lot of fun songs especially "The Bare Necessities"
Yes, I remember that one.
All of them seemed to be based in a jazz theme.
yes, must've been a theme back in the late 60s.
Is that when it was released?
Yes, 1967. A good while ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Alladin movies are there all together?
I'm not sure. I only saw the first one.
Don't remember if there are two or three.
Don't know, but the first one was a great movie.
It was. I liked Alladin.
Robin Williams was a great Genie.
I forgot that was him.
He was good.
Gilbert Gottfried was in that too.
Yes, he was the bird.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I love Mulan. It's so full of girl power!
I've never watched it before. What's it about?
Well, the main girl, Mulan, takes her father's place to train and fight in the Chinese army. She pretends to be a man the entire time, while learning how to fight.
That sounds exciting and frightening at the same time! She got caught eventually, right?
Oh definitely. But the general didn't have her killed since she previously saved his life.
So what happens next?
Mulan saves the day by defeating her enemies all by herself and becomes a respected member in her family.
Wow, sounds like I definitely have to watch this. I can't believe I haven't heard of Mulan until you told me.
You will not regret watching it. After the end of the movie, I bet that you'll want to sign up for martial arts lessons!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Four words. Beauty and the Beast.
Three words. Oh my god.
Two words. I know.
One word. Amazing.
I instantly fell in love with Emma Watson, she was amazing and so beautiful.
I fell in love with Josh Gad. He was too cute.
Oh yeah, really strong move from Disney to have an openly gay character.
I had no idea they were so progressive.
Although it might have been just for the publicity.
Oh come on you're such a cynic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that Disney movie Beauty and the Beast?
The new one with actors, or the animated one?
The original animated one.
Of course.  My daughter watches it all the time.
Who is her favorite character?
She loves Belle the most.
Of course, but does she like any other characters?
She loves the little cup...I think his name is Chip.
Oh, I love Chip, too.  Him and his mother, the pot.
Her name is Mrs. Potts, I believe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
For someone who likes Disney what would you recommend
recommend?
Yeah recommend
From what
Where to watch them
Well  i would say if you want movies Netflix if you want shows Hulu are your best choices
Are they expensive
Nah they are dirt cheap
That is good Thanks
No problem
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen alladin
I have when I was a kid.
It was one of my favorite movies.
Yes Robin Williams did a really good job in it.
He did the movie for next to nothing.
Really how much?
Only $75000
That's nothing for someone like Williams.
Yes but he didn't do any of the sequels.
I've never seen those.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the new Frozen movie will be about?
What?? New Frozen movie?
Yeah! There's a Frozen sequel that's coming out November 27, 2019.
Really/ Where can I get info about it?
IMDb will probably be helpful. Elsa has the voice voice actor, by the way.
Oh, you mean Idina Menzel. Well, I hope it'll have better songs.
Yes, the so.gs in Frozen were pretty cheesy. Especially "Love is an Open Door".
Yep, that was pretty terrible and corny.
Well, I'm just wondering what the plot line will be.
I hope it isn't about Elsa running away from her problems again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Pinocchio the other day. I hadn't seen it in years.
I watched that a few times when I was a kid, but it was a little too scary for me.
The whale still scares me a little!
I would never want to get swallowed by a whale like that, that's for sure.
All of the Pleasure Island parts are scary, too! He basically gets kidnapped!
And he almost turns into a donkey like the other boys.
When you talk about it like this, it's surprising that it's a movie for children!
Yeah, but there were cute parts.
Everything with Jiminy Cricket was cute, I think!
I thought Figaro and Cleo were cute, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Frozen, Brave, or Tangled more?
I like Brave the best. So, does my wife.
Why do you like it more?
Because my family is Scottish.
Cool. Did you like the story?
Yes, the mom turning into a bear was really cool.
Yeah, I agree.
I wish they made a second one.
Me too. I heard they are making another Frozen movie.
Awesome. I can't wait to see what they do with it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Rescuers?
I just watched it for the first time recently. I loved the mice.
Did you see part 2?
There's a part 2?
Yeah, it came out decades after part 1.
Cool. What is it called?
The Rescuers Down Under
Is it like the first one?
Yeah, but they have to save a new kid of course.
I must watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Parent Trap was such a cool movie
I liked that they ended up at the same summer camp that  was cool
did you know in the original they used a mirror image of the same girl?
No I did not know that
yes, they did not have the technology back then like we do now
That makes it even cooler now that I think of it
and how they got their parents back together? so cute!
But who separates twins like that?
seriously, that is kind of messed up
they should have kept them together
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would you say is your favorite Disney character?
There are so many to choose from, but if I had to pick just one, I think I'd say Robin Hood.
Wow, that's an oldie but a goodie! Why Robin Hood?
Well, he seemed to have a lot of morals as well as charisma with the ladies. I kind of like that.
He robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. I don't know if that's great morals or not.
True, but the rich he robbed from where all kind of jerks. Not that it's right to steal from anyone.
True! I wonder if they will ever re-make that one.
I don't know, I haven't heard anything in years about Robin Hood.
That would be something though, don't you think?
With today's technology and graphic ability, it could be amazing!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
Good question- there are so many!  I think it is either Inside Out or Up.
Oh, I loved Up so much.  It was so funny but sweet, too.
I think I cried a little at the beginning!   Have you seen Inside Out?
No, but I want to.  It looks great.
It is cute and would be great for someone who teaches kids about feelings.
Oh, I will definitely look into that.  I bet a lot of my kids have seen it already.
Yeah, you could use the dolls or movie clips or something!
That's a great idea.  I will go see if it is on Netflix.
Great.  Let me know if you like it as much as I do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame?
No I must have missed that one
You should watch it. It's one of my favorites.
Oh yea? Why is that?
It's not your typical movie about a princess in love and distress.
So it's about a hunchback in love and distress.
Well, yes but it's much darker.
Darker than..LION KING?! BAMBI?!
Different kind of dark. Lust from a priest, corruption of the church...
Well that does sound different, I'll check it out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any Disney movies recently?
Yes I saw High School musical 2.
What that a good movie?
It was alright.
Would you recommend it to me to see?
Well definitely in terms of the musical aspect.
So the music was better?
Way better. I think Zac Efron and Vanessa really grew as actors and performers in it.
Fantastic. I will make a point to see it.
Please do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard their making a live action Lion King movie?
No way! Who's in it?
Donald Glover and Beyonce.
That's so cool, will they do the original songs.
I hope so, with Beyonce it might even be better than the original.
Nothing could be better than the original it's a classic.
Yeah you're right but it could come close.
Do you know when it comes out?
May 2019, I think.
Cool, I'll book tickets now then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that Cars 3 is coming out??
Yes! My son is so excited for it to start!
Mine too! It's all he can talk about.
I'm a little worried though. He's still young and Cars 2 wasn't that great.
True, I haven't let mine see 2 yet, but the reviews for 3 are great!
I've seen that too!
Do you want to go together when it comes out?
Sure!  When does it release?
3 days from now.
Ok, want to go on Saturday?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think my favorite Disney movie is Hercules.
Hmm, mine is probably Frozen.
Oh man, everyone loved that movie!
Yeah, the songs really get stuck in your head.
My daughter couldn't stop singing "The cold never bothered me anyway!"
Ha ha! I couldn't stop singing it either. It drove my husband crazy!
Hercules had some great music too! Remember when Megera sang, "I won't say I'm in love!"?
Oh right! The muses were great in that film! I loved that they were all shapes and sizes.
Me too! I swear, that song was my theme song. I never thought I'd get married!
And look at you now! A Disney-esque princess... turned Queen. Congratulations!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Pocahontas?
I did
I wonder how accurate it was
It made it seem like the Indians worshiped nature
The colonists were just after money
The colonists were afraid of the Indians for no reason
Yeah, in the movie Pocohontas kept them from basically going to war
You would think the colonists would have been outnumbered
The Indians would have won
Yeah
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Tron was a Disney offering?
I did not. The original was super 80s.
Completely. But ahead of its time in some ways.
I'm better familiar with the sequel.
It was serviceable. I liked Jeff Bridges and his de-aged clone Clu.
Yeah, but you're forgetting about the best part: Olivia Wilde as Quora.
Heh, good point, but that wasn't the best part.
Oh? Name something better.
The score. Daft Punk at its absolute finest.
I forgot about that - it was pretty epic wasn't it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I love Mulan.
I do too! How good is Eddie Murphy in it?
He is too funny!
And I love that there is so much female empowerment in the film.
Yes, women really can do anything.
Speaking of female empowerment, what did you think about Moana?
It was phenomenal, especially the music!
Oh yeah, the songs were fantastic.
I also love her grandmother. She is a hilarious free spirit!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hello.
Do you have a disney movie that you like the best?
Out of all of them?
Yeah.
I would say the robin hood one.
The one with the foxes?
Yeah.
I love that one.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what Disney movie I've always disliked?
What one?
The Little Mermaid. It drives me insane.
Oh no. Why is that?
I hate that Ariel gives up her mermaid life for a man.
Yeah, that's quite the sacrifice. Who wouldn't want to live under the sea?
I wish I could be under the sea right now!
Me too! Especially to escape this scorching summer heat.
That chick's voice is annoying too.
Wow. You've got some strong feelings about poor Ariel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched Bambi last night for the first time with my six year old niece.
Did she like it?
She liked Thumper the best.
Seems like most little girls like Thumper and Flower the best.
Boys tend to go to Bambi.
Or, Bambi's father.
I think many little girls sympathize with Flower.
I do too, I know I did.
She has such a cute little face.
That flower behind her ear is adorable, really makes her character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey do you want to go swimming with me?
no ill have to pass im not very good at swimming
oh that sucks to hear, i can teach you
possibly but ill just wish so i can become a mermaid
oh wow, like ariel?
yes from the little mermaid, i love that movie
it sounds like you do, but it was a good movie
yes i just hated the bad lady ursula
oh yeah she was up to no good
the bad guys will never succeed, but once i become a mermaid ill talk to you about swimming
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you gonna watch the new Star Wars movie that comes out later this year?
They have another one coming out so soon?
Yea, they are putting one out each year - usually around December I think.
I'm not sure if I'll see anymore.
Why not?
I didn't really like the idea of them killing off Han Solo.
Yea, neither did out but it did make for a good surprise.
Still not sure about seeing the others.
Will you go if I buy your ticket?
Of course, I'll watch just about anything for free!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the movie "The Sword in the Stone"?
Yes actually that was one of my favorite movies as a child
Mine too
Funny that you should bring it up, I just watched this the other night with my children
Really?  What did they think of it?
Suprisingly they enjoyed it considering how its from the 60's
Gosh is the movie really that old
Yeah hard to believe I remember it like it was fresh in the theatre
Just goes to show how quick time flies
No wonder my daughter calls me an old fuddy duddy
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really think some of disneys movies are poor
What ones
Most of their original stuff is good
Okay?
It is  the sequels that blow
But why
Well they seem to forget what made the original good
Not really
Yes really several of them do
How so
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch disney movies?
Yes my family and I love them
Mine too
Have you seen Brave?
Yes it was a good movie
Those three litlle boys were adorable as bear cubs
Yes they were
It was such a good movie
With a good message at the end
Yes, love your mother!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie of all time?
That's such a hard question!
I know right? Mine would have to be a tie between The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.
Both good options. But what about Mulan?
Oh I forgot about Mulan. I didn't own it growing up.
I did. It was one of my favorites. We had so many great movies growing up.
We got the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Mulan, The Lion King.
Emperor's New Groove - and of course, Toy Story.
Toy Story! Oh I forgot about that one.
Yeah, we sure were spoiled with Disney movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Disney's The Black Cauldron?
Yes. That movie really scared me when I was little.
It was a bit dark for a Disney movie.
I remember hearing they squished pasta to make the sound effects for the living dead army.
Really? I had not heard that.
That was the only part that freaked me out as a kid. The rest was ok though.
Even the part where Gurgi sacrifices himself?
I'd forgotten that part.
Didn't the witches say they could not save him, but they did?
I think so. I wonder why they said that?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney and Pixar movie?
I loved Ratatouille.
Oh, how come that's your favorite?
Everything in it is so pretty!
It makes me want to visit France, for sure. Even if I eat food cooked by a rat chef.
Hey, Remy was a great cook!
I know! He really impressed the food critic.
I was so nervous for them during that scene, but it turned out alright after all.
I felt bad for Remy that his family wasn't very nice to him.
That worked out, too, though, because they ended up supporting him when he needed it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Wreck-It Ralph and it has to be my new favorite movie!
I saw it a few years ago when it came out and thought it was just okay.
You only thought it was okay?
Yeah, I just didn't really connect with the characters.
I grew up playing video games, so this movie really hit home with me.
I grew up with video games too, but I thought the plot wasn't that great.
What was wrong with the plot?
I just didn't like the ending I suppose. Also, that one candy girl annoyed me.
Her name was Vanellope!
See, it must not have been that great if I can't even remember the main character's name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe that Cars 3 is now out in theaters?
It's kind of hard to believe there is a Cars 3.
I guess they think people want more Lightning McQueen.
Maybe so. Have you seen any of them?
Yes, I've seen Cars and Cars 2. Have you?
I have. What did you think of them?
The original Cars was pretty good, but I didn't really care for Cars 2. Things got a little dark for me.
I know what you mean. I wish they would have just left it alone.
Mater, Doc, Sally, and all the rest of them are what made the first one so good.
I know. If they bring in a bunch of other characters it just won't be the same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what the first movie was I saw in the Drive In Theatre?
What?
Herbie Rides Again.
Is that the Disney movie about the car?
Yes it is.
Wow, how old were you?
I was eight and the whole family went to see it.
A VW Beetle that can talk.
I know right, but it was a cute idea.
They were good movies back then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the new Disney movie, Moana?
I love the movie. It has a great storyline and awesome music.
I think Moana is an amazing role model for young kids.
Yes, she seems very brave and independent.
The graphics in the movie are very realistic.
Yes they are, Disney is improving over time.
I think Moana brings an amazing cultural experience to life.
Yes, my children would love the beach.
It is a good learning experience about different cultures.
Disney is just amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What were your favorite Disney movies as a kid?
I didn't really watch a lot of Disney movies. What were your favorites?
I loved Pocahontas and The Lion King.
Oh the Lion King is still one of my favorite movies.
Yeah, Lion King is great. I also liked Tarzan.
I have never seen Tarzan. How is it?
It is good. It also has a lot of animals in it.
I will have to watch it sometime.
You definitively should.  Emperor's New Groove is also good.
Oh, I loved  Emperor's New Groove as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Quick question. Who is your favorite Disney villain?
I will say Maleficent.
Did you like the movie with Angelina Jolie?
Yes, it holds a special place in my heart.
I prefer the classic Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty.
I like that one as well. I just love happy endings!
Disney is definitely good at happy endings.
Who is your favorite Disney villain?
Hans! I was so shocked when he showed his true colors.
I know, I did not see that one coming!
XXXXXXXXXXX
As far as sports movies, I love Miracle the best.
It was based on a true story.
How did you feel when they won the Olympic gold?
I thought the movie did a great job conveying the emotion.
I loved Kurt Russell as the head coach.
The cast all around was solid.
When they finally beat the Russians, the gold scene was ultimate.
I agree with you a bunch of college players winning was a feel good story.
Some times you cant write scripts that legitimately happen.
Russell made you fall in love with Herb Brooks
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was thinking we should do a disney movie night.
That sounds fun! How many people should we invite?
Maybe 3 or 4? What do you think we should watch.
Hmm. Which do you think are the most fun in a group?
To me that usually means the funniest ones.
Then maybe One Hundred and One Dalmatians?
That sounds like a good choice!
Are there any others we should watch?
How about The Lion King?
Sounds good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
i wish the beatles had been in a disney song
right! they were supposed to voice the vultures in the jungle book
i wish they had
yeah, either that or they were in a different movie.
i guess it's too late now
unless their heads are frozen like walt disney, yeah
do you really believe that rumor?
i do. i'm just waiting for disney to make a movie about it and confirm
that would be pretty cool, i guess
i need more movies by walt!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I started reading the book The Black Cauldron is based on today.
You did? Is it any good.
It's so-so. Very fantasy pulp.
Well, it was used to make a children's movie.
The book is a lot slower. I guess it's a series, and The Black Cauldron is the first two books.
They do cover a lot of ground with that movie.
It's unusual that I like the movie better than the book, but I think that might be the case.
That happened to me with The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
The original is better?
Much better. And much sadder.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally saw Bambi the other day with the family.
Oh yeah, how did you like it?
I loved it. I can't believe I didn't see it until now.
Yeah, I'm surprised you have only just now seen it. It's a classic.
I'm behind on all the Disney movies, to be quite honest.
You should rent a bunch of them and binge watch.
Now that's an idea.
Your kids will love them.
I'm sure they will.
When you're finished, tell me what you thought of Frozen. That's my favorite one so far.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen tangled?
No but i havent wanted to ever since i saw frozen.
I think it was good, i enjoyed it.
Ill have to watch it
You should, its good
I have it recorded on my dvr, ill have to watch it tonight now
I bought it, my kids and i really enjoy it.
Im sure ill like it, all disney movies are great
Yes they are, i hope you enjoy it
Thank you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Finding Dory movie yet?
No, I haven't. Was it good?
Yes! It had very cute characters.
Can you describe them?
Dory's parents were in it! There were also multiple friends made along the way!
That sounds really interesting.
Baby Dory was just the utest thing imaginable.
I really want to watch the movie now!
That movie really brought back great childhood memories.
I know, even though it came out so many years after the first movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Pocahontas?
Ya back in the day I did watch it.
I just learned that Christian Bale was the voice of thomas.
That is surprising , you would think he would have been John smith.
I am surprised he did any voice on it at all.
It is a little bit but many big stars have voiced for disney films.
I suppose that is true. demi moore jason alexander to name a few others.
What I liked most on this movie was the music. Colors of the wind was beautiful.
That song has such a true message. I wish people coudl care more about the environment.
Disney has created some very profond music with a message.Circle of life is another song  that just wows me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love how complex Disney movies are getting.
I think complexity was always present.  But now it's evolving.
That is what I meant.  Take the movie 'Inside Out,' for instance.
I thoroughly enjoyed that film.
The whole thing was an allegory for puberty and growing up in the world.
I never looked at it that way, but you're right.
The voice acting was also spot on.
Who were some of the actors and actresses?
Amy Poehler and Bill Hader were two of the main voices.
I didn't realize that.  It makes sense that two SNL alum would play such funny characters!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Monsters Inc. character?
Sully was my favorite.
He was great. There were a lot of good actors doing voices in that.
I know. John Goodman, Billy Crystal and a bunch of others.
The little girl was so cute.
She was, and not afraid of them.
Who did her voice?
I think that was Jennifer Tilly.
Yeah, it could have been.
Google it, I think I'm right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wasn't Tom Hanks in Toy Story?
I think so, was that the movie with the cowboy and the space explorer?
Yeah! They were toys that came to life at night. I think Tom Hanks was the voice of the cowboy.
You're right, and Tim Allen was the voice of the space explorer, Buzz Lightyear!
I remember watching that show as a kid and being so afraid of the neighbor boy, Sid.
He was such a bad kid!
I was so scared when the toys were stuck at Sid's house, but the best part was when they escaped.
With the help of the other toys! The barbie doll legs with the hook head and the baby that had spider legs.
They seemed scary at first but were actually good!
I know! Those toys just had bad luck being with Sid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Aladdin?
An absolute classic, the songs are great and the characters memorable.
I especially loved the late Robin Williams as the genie
It really was the perfect role for him in many ways.
What's your favorite some from the film?
It may seem like an overly trendy choice, but a whole new world.
I don't see it as overly trendy at all, it's probably the most popular one for good reason.
Yeah I remember I was a child when the came out, would sing the song for days after.
I think we will both agree on this one, it's one of the better Disney films.
You're right I do agree, it's in my top five for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Cars 3 is finally in theaters. Are you going to see it?
Yes, I remember liking the first 2 movies. How about you?
Yes, I want to see it. Who does Lightning McQueen's voice again?
Owen Wilson
Oh yeah...And who played Mater?
That is Larry the Cable Guy.
Oh, he's hilarious!
Yes, I like him too. I hope he's in Cars 3.
Definitely! Hey, want to see it together tomorrow?
Sure, let's check the show times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that new movie that came out recently in November?
Oh, you mean Moana? Yes, I have, it's so good.
Yes, I agree. I've been singing "You.re Welcome" ever since it came out.
Me too! Dwayne Johnson was so good in that movie.
I know, he's been in a bunch of good disney movies.
Oh really? What has he been in?
Well, he was in the Game Plan with Madison Pettis.
Oh, was that him? I forgot about that movie. It's so good though.
Yes, it's one of my favorites. I really like that he switched to animated movies though.
I agree, he definitely has the voice for it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Disney bought Star Wars?
No way!
Yup, they are making the next 3 movies!
Seven, eight, and nine?
Yes, Seven came out last year?
Awesome, how was it?
Excellent, it was a great movie!
Now I'm so excited, no spoilers :)
I don't give anything away!
Thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Finding Dory?
Yes, I prefered Finding Nemo though.
I liked them both but I do think Finding Nemo was better.
Ellen was great as Dory.
Yes. I liked having the back story of what happened to Dory. Ellen was great.
My favorite part in Finding Nemo was when she was talking to the whale.
It was kind of sad though.
I think all Disney movies have sad parts.
The two movies aren't totally related though. I think I was expecting that.
I guess when I think about Finding Nemo, Dory does stick out.  Guess that is why they went that route.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey you look like Elsa from Frozen in that blue dress!
Oh sure, I just need a long blonde braid.
So if you're Elsa, does that make me Olaf?
Oh no way! You're lots smarter than Olaf!
At least I'm trustworthy, so Hans.
Yeah Hans was a traitor!
Maybe I should go to the costume store and dress like Anna.
Oh sure. ' cause I've always wanted a sister!
So I guess that leaves us Sven?
Well he is the most cuddly character!
XXXXXXXXXXX
It looks like they're making a live action version of Disney's The Little Mermaid.
That should be interesting to see. I wonder how they'll create the "under the sea" look.
Not sure, but I hope they keep it pretty true to the original, not like the upcoming remake of Mulan.
I don't know how I feel about this, though. The live shows they've been doing on TV of musicals haven't been that great.
I am hoping that, at the very least, I can enjoy the music.
I wonder if they'll add any new songs.
Like in the new Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, that would be awesome! Maybe have Eric sing something.
I wonder if the animals will be puppets or animated?
I don't know, but it will be interesting to see how they do Ursula!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the latest version of Tron?
That would be, “Tron: Legacy” in 2010.
Yes, it was quite different to the original Tron released in the 80s.
I think the story was very different, but the visuals were quite similar.
I would have to disagree.
In what way do you think the visuals were different?
The visuals in the new version of Tron were more vibrant, the suits that the characters wear glow more realistically.
In the original Tron the suits that the characters wear glow too.
Yes, but in the new version the glow is more realistic, in the original version it looked like a cartoon.
I think both movies were ahead of their time, and had amazing visuals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Oh, it's so hard to pick! I love Mulan.
I think that Frozen is my favorite.
It's certainly my daughter's favorite! But I'm so tired of listening to "Let it Go."
I love that song. I could listen to it a million times.
Elsa's a great character. But I prefer Mulan. I mean, she saves China!
Well, Elsa saves the kingdom from being frozen.
Yes, from a problem she causes! Plus, I think Mulan's romance with Shang is cute.
But Frozen has that great family relationship between the sisters.
I'll still take Mulan, but I know Frozen has all those fans for a reason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Disney hero?
Robin Hood
He is really funny. I like his character.
Him and Little John are a great duo.
Who is another one you like?
Aladdin.
He is good too.
Robin Hood is great though. He has that memorable hat and bow.
That is true. That is an underrated Disney film.
Yes, it is. So is The Sword in the Stone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We should watch a Disney movie tonight.
Which one did you want to see?
I think I want to watch Alice in Wonderland.
The live action version?
Yes, that one. Its my favorite.
Did you know that Anne Hathaway was originally offered the role of Alice?
No I didn't. Why didn't she do it?
She felt it to was too similar to other roles she played.
The White Queen was a great role for her then.
It was. I liked that was completely different than her normal characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Disney princess?
Does Mulan count as a princess? I think she's my favorite.
I don't think Mulan is really a princess.
In that case, I choose Belle. I think she's a good influence.
Why is that?
She loves to read, and I think that's important.
I like Cinderella the best.
Cinderella's friendly, but she didn't really do anything.
Cinderella was hard working though, always doing chores for her step sisters and step mother.
Belle was an intellectual, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
With the new Beauty and the Beast movie out, did you happen to re-watch the original Disney animated version again?
Yes, I did. I had too. I wanted to compare the two movies.
Me too. I loved the Disney animated movie better.
So did I. I think Belle was my favorite character out of them all.
Oh, really? I always liked Chip and Mrs. Potts the best.
Did you like Gaston's character?
Well, not really. I think he was kind of a boring character.
At the end, Gaston was the one who died right?
Yeah, he fell off the wall of the castle when he tried to kill the beast.
Oh, yeah. I forgot what had happened in his final scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the original cartoon Jungle Book or the live action Jungle Book better?
I like the live action one better.
Why?
I think a fantastic job was done making the animals come to life.
I know. They looked so real to me.
Me, too. I also thought the kids who played Mowgli did a good job.
He had good facial expressions.
He also was so agile.
That must have been so much fun to play that role.
I think so, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The film Pocahontas is based on the biographical and real story of a sailor and soldier named John Smith!
Yes, and an Indian princess from the tribe of Native American Indians called Matoaka, whom they all knew as Pocahontas because of their long hair.
All this happened in 1608!
Very well and the official premiere of the film in the United States was June 23, 1995. It was a movie that won several awards
It was a movie that won several awards
Sure, like the Oscar, Best Soundtrack, Best Song.
I love the whole plot.
And it is! Especially since Pocahontas is a revelry Indian princess.
The love story between Pocahontas and John Smint is beautiful!
It's a shame that they have to split up at the end, with one last farewell kiss.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey little girl!
Hi Dad!
I was cleaning out the attic and came across this box of old Disney storybooks.
Oh, awesome!
But take a look at this one, 101 Dalmations.
Yeah.
Look at this page. Read it and tell me what you think.
That doesn't seem right. It did happen that way in the movie!
That's right! They changed the story details in the book!
Political correctness, I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you have a disney movie that you like the best?
Robin Hood always has a special place in my heart.
The one where robin hood is a fox?
Yeah that's the one.
I love the snake in that one.
Yeah he always lisps.
Reminds me a lot of growing up.
Yeah me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Tron sequel.
Unfortunately!
Didn't quite have the same charm.
You can say that again.
I miss the Master Control Program.
Of all the things to get nastalgic about!
Ha! I just thought the young Jeff Bridges made for a weak villian.
Tron was the first movie I ever saw him in.
Incredible actor.
How did they make him look so young?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, the kids want to watch Moana.
We just watched it yesterday and this morning.
Well they really like it. Put it on?
I suppose so. It's not the worst one to watch over and over.
You know it's cute and the kids love it.
Yeah I know. I probably know every line verbatim.
What can I say except you're welcome!
I'd rather be shiny! Love that crab song.
Yeah me too. It is one of the cooler parts of the movie.
I think they did a really great job with the tribute to Bowie there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I really loved the Little Mermaid.
I loved that one also! I wanted red hair just like Ariel.
It's so weird now that we are adults and some of the things that went on in Disney movies. Ariel totally gave up her home, family and voice to be with a man.
LOL, you are right she completely sold her soul to Ursula for a man she didn't even know.
She didn't know that man at all. To make matters worse he fell in love with her and she couldn't even talk. What kind of shit is that?
but what about Belle? The beast totally kidnapped her and she fell in love....can you say Stockholm Syndrome
Can you say bestialty? She definitely kissed a walking lion.
Omigosh, she so fell in love with an animal. No wonder they named the movie "Beauty and the Beast" or the NSFW version "Beauty and the Bestiality"
Gotta love Disney!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Disney movie that came out?
Which one?
Moana, I think is what is called.
Oh no I havent seen it yet.
Me either. I was hoping to get your input on it.
Yea. sorry I am no help.
That's ok. I bet it is great and it gives a perspective in to the Polynesian way.
Yea. I like that.
I will just have to see it.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Moana?
Yes!  I loved it.  My daughter didn't like it as much though and I don't know why.
Maybe she was comparing it to Frozen.  I heard a lot of people were.
Maybe.  I personally loved the songs in Moana.
Me too.  I feel like Disney is really having a big revival recently.
They're also making all those live versions of their old films.  That could go on for quite a while.
I think I heard they're doing one for The Lion King.
I will definitely have to check that out.  Beauty and the Beast was great.
I thought so too.  Emma Watson wasn't really that great in it to me though.
Really?  I thought she was exactly how Belle should act.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see the live action Beauty and the Beast?
I don't know. I love the animated one so much.
I see, you want to keep your memories intact?
Exactly! How perfect is the first scene? Or the one where the Beast really lets his anger go?
What about Gaston's song? So clever!
It's just a perfect film. No wonder it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.
I don't think you need to worry--my mom saw the new one and said it's fantastic.
What did she like about it?
She said Emma Thompson is perfect.
Hmmm...maybe I need to make time to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the live version of Beauty and the Beast?
Yes I did.
What did you think of it?
I thought it was really well done.
Me too, I was afraid they would mess it up.
I was too, but they kept it really similar to the cartoon version.
I thought the casting was excellent!
Oh, so did I.  Emma Watson was great as Belle.
I hope Disney does more live action movies based off of cartoons.
So do I, they're bringing back my childhood.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey what do you think about snow white?
wasnt she the one with the six dwarfs?
Kinda but she had seven not six
Oh my bad, but yeah i know of her what about her?
just wondering if you think i should dress up as her for halloween
oh yeah that would be cool
would you be willing to be my prince?
haha i guess i could do that for you
great i will get the costume ready for the party
sounds good, i guess ill watch it again to be up to date
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Cars 2 yet?
No not yet, but I heard good things about it.
Yes, it has gotten some good reviews.
I heard that it is better than the last film they made.
Yes that one was ridiculous with the spy theme.
This one is supposed to stick to car racing like the original.
That sounds good. I will probably see it tomorrow.
It is nice that Disney put out a movie that is not just princess themed.
I know. It sometimes seems unfair to boys with all these princess themed movies.
So true. Well let me know what you think about it after you see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you know that Cars 3 is already in theaters now?
No way! It is?
Yeah I want to go see it really bad. It looks good.
I loved the first cars and second one.
This new one is about Lightning McQueen still trying to prove himself in a new generation of racers.
Oh okay. Well should be really good.
Yeah it looks like they have some new characters as well.
It's always exciting when there are new characters.
I am just glad Mater is in it again.
Mater is the best character. I love the guy who does his voice, Larry the Cable Guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Finding Dory?
Yes, I loved it.
Did you like it better than Finding Nemo?
Yes, cause that octopus.
Yeah, he was very funny.
It was sad at parts, but overall it was amazing.
I wonder how much it made.
I'm not sure. But, probably a lot.
Did you see it in theaters?
No, I saw it on Blu Ray.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Anna and Elsa are awesome. I love that sisterly love they have.
I wouldn't know, I've never had a sister. I was an only child.
Did you ever want a sister or a brother?
Sometimes, but, usually, I was okay with just being an only child and having my cousins and my friends.
I love my sister. I can't imagine not having her in my life. I would feel horrible if we had to be separated.
I probably would, too, had I a sister. I do know what love feels like, that's pretty universal.
Sometimes I like to be by myself, but I still want to be close to her.
So, would you be more of an Elsa or an Anna?
Anna, totally. I may be the older one, but I don't think I'm that mature.
I think you are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the first Disney movie you saw in the theater?
The Little Mermaid. I loved it!
Oh! My favorite character is Sebastian!
Yeah, he's great. I love the song "Kiss the Girl."
Me too! But, "Under the Sea" is my favorite.
Great song! My favorite character is Ursula.
You really like villains don't you?
Yep! Especially women villains.
Maybe it was seeing the movie that set you on that path.
Maybe!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Disney has been making some pretty amazing movies lately.
I know, Moana was one of my favorites.
My daughter loved that movie, I’ve seen it 10 times already, still makes me laugh every time.
I know what you mean, it’s on everyday in my household, Beauty and the beast as well.
I haven’t seen that yet, is good for the kids?
Yes, they go crazy for it. I can play that, finding Nemo and then finding dory and it fills the kids days.
I know finding nemo and dory inside out, my kids finally stopped watching finding nemo and then finding dory came out.
I don’t mind though, I love the Disney Pixar movies, toy story 1, 2 and 3 were my favorites.
I love putting those on, I can watch them over and over again. Which one was your favorite.
I love number 2, don’t ask me why, I just love the story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! How do you feel about the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie coming out?
I don't know, I wish they would have stopped making them after the third movie because Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom aren't even in the fourth movie.
True, I see your point. But they've really tried to revamp the whole storyline - especially by adding some Disney theme park rides featuring the Pirates of the Caribbean.
I get that. But I just don't think the movies beyond the third one are any good! They can't live up to the greatness of the first three movies.
So I need to find someone else to go the movies to see the latest one with, eh?
Probably, yes.
Alright, well, that's okay. What's your favorite most recent Disney movie?
I actually just watched Moana on Netflix today and enjoyed it. It was a bit short but overall a good storyline and it sure was pretty.
Oh good! I liked it, too!
Yeah, turns out I might still be a fan of some of the new Disney movies after all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken was such a good movie
It was, she had this dream and it came true
but at a price, she lost her sight
I know the impact from diving, that was sad
diving horses was a real thing , that is what I heard
I also heard that , I used to imagine I was a horse diver
I bet it was hard on the horses though
I do not think PETA would like that now
now that I think of it, I bet that was animal abuse in some way
yes, and dangerous to people as well/
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know in Bambi when his mum dies, did you cry?
You bet I did, that was arguably the saddest moment in any Disney film ever.
Thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Don't worry I think everyone cries when they watch Bambi.
At least Bambi has happy life in the end?
Really. Do you not remember who the villain was in Bambi.
The villain? I can't really think who it was?
The villain was mankind.
Crikey mate, that was deep.
Yeah I saw it in a Buzzfeed quiz.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey my daughter is having a play this weekend about "The Little Mermaid" do you want to go?
Yes absolutely, what part does she play?
Well she tried out for Ariel but someone else got the part
That sucks!
Yeah but she ended up getting a couple parts, her first part is the Mental Chef
Totally fitting for her
Yes and her second part is a manta ray
So kind of a cameo part
Yeah its a non speaking part
Still she will do very well in it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Toy Story when you were younger?
Yeah, it's my favorite movie!
Woody was my favorite character, what about yours?
I really liked Buzz Lightyear!
Buzz was cool, I had a Buzz toy when I was a kid.
That's awesome, could he fly?
No, just like the movie he couldn't.
Would have been cool if he had.
Yeah, but he lid up and said cool phrases.
I should get one of those for my nephew.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard bout the upcoming sequel to Mary Poppins?
No.When is it coming out?
Sometime in 2018.
Will Julie Andrews be playing Mary Poppins again?
A different actress will be playing the part, but Dick Van Dyke will have a part.
Is he playing Bert again?
He's playing a different character.
Will there be music?
As far as I know there will be.
OK. I'm putting this on my movie list.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
That's such a hard question there have been so many good ones, like Up or the classics like Snow White.
Ya I recently watched a documentary about Disney I didn't know with the classics like Snow White all the scenes were painted by hand.
That's really cool when think about all the work that went into each scene.
I think my favorite is with the wicked witch some of her scenes are so detailed it's hard to believe everything was hand painted.
I would love to watch the movie again thinking of that.
I know some of the scenes in the forest are very detailed too.
I think the music is really good in that movie too.
Ya most of those songs are still really popular today.
Whistle while You Work is still one of my favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what Disney did you like?
original disney?
yeah. I liked treasure planet
that was a good one.
I loved the soundtrack
I liked Timon and pumba, the show.
I don't even remember that.
does it even count?
I guess it is affiliated with disney
but its not a full movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the new jungle book?
I did, but think I enjoyed disney's animated version better.
Really that surprises me. I thought the new one was far beyond the original.
Well I loved the animated so much when I was younger hard to accept the new one.
I can see that. I loved christopher walkin in the new one.
He was a good choice for sure. I did think they did a great job casting.
Yes they did scarlet johanson's voice was such a smart choice as well.
I did like that they turned it female. Made sense with the seduction aspect.
Agreed. I think they did a wonderful job with the CGI as well.
I do think Disney has really mastered that CGI well. Especially with the jungle book remake.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the next Disney animated movie will be?
I don't know but if its like tangled or frozen then I hope it comes soon
I know! I love their new style.
Yes but their old style is also good.
I think they need to have a mix of both 3d and 2d animated movies
I agree
Why do you think they don't do it?
Because money
You think Disney is only in it for the money?
Yes, definitely. Why do you think they charge so much to go into their parks?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did you think of the new Beauty and The Beast movie?
I liked it. It reminded me a lot of the original animated version.
Yes, the two are pretty similar. What did you like most about it?
The musical numbers were really good.
I agree, there were some great songs in that one. Which was your favorite?
The most memorable for me will always be the opening song.
The one sung by Belle and the townspeople?
Yes, that's the one.
Yeah, I like that one, too. It's catchy!
It definitely is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Disney movie?
probably mulan
that was a great movie
it was feminist too
she saved the country
yup. finally there was a good heroine in disney
we've seen a lot more heroines now
she kinda paved the way
I agree with her
mulan was great
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need to get netflix or something
Why
Because i lost all my DVDs
How did that happen
When i was moving they broke
That is awful
I know right
What movies you looking for
I want Disney movies
I think netflix has some of those on their
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the movie "Babes in Toyland"?
No, not really. Who was in it?
It was one of Drew Barrymore's first movies. She was the star.
I really don't remember. What was it about again?
It's about this girl who cares for her family and acts like an adult, refusing to ever be treated as a child until she's transported to Toyland on Christmas Eve,
Wow, I can't say I've ever seen that.
That's crazy, but It is pretty old.
When did it come out?
The original came out in 1961, and the Drew Barrymore version came out in 1986.
Yeah, I really don't think I've seen it! I'll have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi Ho Hi Ho , Its Off To Work We Go!!
Another Monday. No little birds chirping around my head this morning.
Cranky dwarf in da' house!
Ugh. I'm not cranky, but Sleepy and me are tight.
That poor woman having to deal with seven men.
I know right. It would not be very "Maleficent"
See your singing a song to a better day already.
Digging in a mine would be better then at this desk.
Seesh. I'll make sure not to eat any apples you throw my way today.
Magic clock on my desk. Make my day go fast, that would be the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Pocahontas yesterday.
Cool.  When was that released?
1995.
Who directed?
Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg
Who was the voice of Pocahontas?
Irene Bedard, but Judy Kuhn sang.
And John Smith?
Mel Gibson!
That's a riot!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does your son have a favorite movie?
Yes, he loves Moana. Maui is his favorite character.
Does he already have an action figure of Maui? I saw one in the store yesterday that might be perfect.
Nothing yet.
Perfect! I think I found a birthday present for him then.
I know he'll love it.
Oh, what about the movie? Do you guys have a copy?
No, we can stream it from Netflix now, but I don't know how long that will last.
Okay. Maybe I'll grab a blu-ray copy and tuck that in the bag.
That would be amazing! I know he'd love the gift.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard they are going to make a live-action Lion King movie!
Oh not another one those!
What, you aren't a big fan of those live action remakes?
I don't know... every time I watch them I prefer the original ones, not to discredit the films.
Well I heard they are going to reprise the voice actor for Mufasa!
Ok, that does sound pretty cool! What about the songs?
I'm not too sure, the original ones are so iconic, I dont think the studios would want to mess that up!
They had them in the new Beauty and the Beast adaptation?
Yah those songs were fine but they just don't speak to me like the original.
I agree, maybe thisi adaptation will do something different.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the new movie Coco that's coming out soon?
No, I haven't. What's it about?
It's about a little boy who wants to become a musician like his idol. His family has a ban on music though.
Oh! That sounds like it'll be good!
It's coming out in November 2017.
That's not too far away!
I'm excited for the movie soundtrack.
I bet it will sound amazing!
The movie is also based around Dia de los Muertos.
That's neat that they are including a Mexican holiday that many people may not know about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Honey We Shrunk the Kids is a great film.
Yeah it is. Rick Morranis is hilarious.
I really like the scene when they find that giant Oatmeal Cream Pie.
Haha. That makes me hungry every time I see it.
And do you remember when they have to fight the giant ant?
Yes. That would make me so scared if ants were really that big.
I want to build a device in my back yard like Rick did and search my yard for bugs.
Yeah, only he was searching for his kids!
I hope I wouldn't find any of those in my yard.
I'm sure you don't have to worry about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Cars 3 yet?
No, I hadn't realized it was coming out so soon.
It came out last weekend.  At least I think it did.
Do you know what it's about?
I'm not sure, but I can't wait to see what kind of trouble Mater gets into this time.
Poor Mater.  He always stumble in to some kind of trouble, doesn't he?
Yes he does, and then Lightning McQueen is generally right there with him.
True.  They kind of bail each other out.
Well, Whatever this one is about, I'm sure it will be enjoyable.
I agree.  Maybe we should find out when it's playing and go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, are you into Disney movies?
I love almost all of them!
Really, me too. What's you favorite from the classics?
Well, Peter pan has always been my favorite. Disney created an amazing world with that one.
I agree, neverland world seems just too amazing!
I know, i mean, who would ever wanted to grow up if we had the chance.
And don't forget about Tinkerbell, she's the magical character in the movie.
Did you like the second part of the movie? Peter pan 2?
I think i liked that one even more than the first one.
It was great, but definitely the first one has my heart!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie of all time?
I would have to say that my favorite is The Little Mermaid.
I love that one, too. I still remember every word to all of the songs.
I do, too. I always loved the way the underwater creatures interacted with the people.
I know. Scuttle was my favorite character.
Oh, he was so funny! I loved when he made up names for items Ariel had found in her cave.
Yes, and explaining how they are used by the people.
Sebastian was a great character also. He was always ending up in danger while trying to watch out for Ariel.
The scene where he was running from the chef was hilarious!
Yes, it was! The whole movie was wonderful - a true classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you name all the seven dwarfs?
Happy, sleepy, grumpy, dopey, bashful, doc, sneezy
Who is a better Disney princess?
I wouldn't say better, But Cinderella is the only one who stays in her home no matter the hardship. She works hard her entire life and yet she still gets the prince
In the Lion King, why did simba run away?
He was feeling guilty for supposedly getting his dad killed.  Scar made him think it was all his fault.
Would you like to live with timon and pumba?
Yes and no.  I want to live in their paradise, waterfalls, swings and no worries. I would not like to eat "grub"
In frozen who is your favorite character?
Oloaf, he is all heart and thoughtful of everyone.  He never has a bad thing to say about anything
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
Disney is horrible
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT!?
Pixar is where it's at
Nah, DIsney movies are better!
No way!  So unimaginative!
How can you say that DISNEY of all companies is unimaginative?
They.. they just ARE!
Great reason..
I thought so too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wasnt Maleficent based on a Disney character?
Of course it was
Wasnt it Snow White?
No it was Sleeping Beauty
Oh ok, Angelina Jolie as a villain was bizarre
It was and I thought the movie was a little boring.
Really? I didnt think it was bad
The box office numbers supported my belief.
Yeah usually Disney movies with stars always work out
I just dont think people really wanted to see her in it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Lilo and Stitch was a severely underrated Disney movie.
I can't remember if I've seen that one--is it the one with the blue guy?
Yeah, he's an alien that lands in Hawaii.
I never saw that one; I guess it just wasn't marketed as much.
Oh, you should totally watch it, I cry every time.
You cry over a movie about a blue alien?
You probably cried about ET didn't you!
...Touche.
It's very sweet and it deals with some real issues--like, Lilo's parents are dead and it deals with adoption and family and stuff.
That is kinda deep. I'll have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok, what do you think is the best Disney ballad?
Colors of the Wind!
That's good, but not as good as Reflection.
That's just because of Lea Salonga.
Ok, you might be right. What about Part of Your World?
Does that count as a ballad?
I think so.
Hmm. Still not as good Colors of the Wind.
Colors of the Wind has a killer bridge, I agree.
It's so inspirational, honestly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think people forget Old Yeller was a disney movie
Well I think it was originally a book
Yeah they adapted it onto the big screen
What a sad story though
He was a good dog
Who starred in that film?
Fess Parker I guess would be the biggest star
Yeah I know it was on older film.
The scene where they have to take him out is so sad.
It was the ultimate heart strings pull
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new version of Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes I did, wasn't it amazing?!
I liked it better than the original.
Me too, what was your favorite part of the movie?
I loved the part when Belle was entertained at dinner by the household items.
Oh yes that was a beautiful scene.
I also loved the music.
The music and songs are awesome, I find myself humming them all the time.
My favorite song is Be our Guest.
I think I like the song about Gaston, it's funny!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally got around to watching Moana.
What did you think about it.
I absolutely loved it.
It looks beautiful and I hear that the soundtrack is awesome too.
Yes it was visually beautiful and also the music is so catchy.
Do you think you will by the movie?
It is one I would want to own for sure.
I think Disney is the best in animation.
Oh, no doubt about that.
I have never been disappointed in any Disney film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
It's got to be Aladdin.
Wow, I love that one too, but I never knew that was your favorite.
I just love the Arabian Nights theme and the Genie.
It's very cool, and yes it does have the connection to old literature.
I find myself getting lost in the story every time.
Were you a kid when it came out in theaters?
Yes, that movie is a part of my childhood, and I have fond memories of going to see it.
I'm a little young to say that, but I still enjoyed watching it years later at home.
It's still good that way, and I make sure to watch it a couple times a year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you see the Lion King?
Yes I have, I love it.
What's your favorite song?
Hakuna Matata of course!
Mine is I Just Can't Wait To Be King.
Another classic by Simba.
Who do you like better, Timon or Puumba?
Puumba is my favorite .
I think the whole soundtrack is pretty good.
Yes, Elton John did a great job.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Moana, yet?
I did! It's a great movie.
I agree. I thought the animation was phenomenal.
You're right. The animation was really well done.
The music was great, too.
Did you know Lin Manuel Miranda wrote the music?
I didn't know that, but it makes sense.
Also, did you know most of the cast is of Polynesian descent?
Yeah, like Dwayne Johnson.
I'm glad Disney embraced that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new, live action Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes I did! I loved it!
Same! I think they did an awesome job following the cartoon.
Yeah, and Emma Watson was a great choice for Bell.
I agree. I found it interesting that they made Le Fou openly gay in this movie.
It's great to see Disney being so progressive and showing gay characters!
Yes, though I know a lot of people are very upset by it.
Oh well, they don't have to watch it then. But they will miss out on some great songs and dances!
Right?! The choreography is so well done!
And the costumes worked so well!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie the Fox and the Hound?
Yes! It´s beautiful.
What do you think about the movie?
It teaches us to be friends with other people that are not like us.
Why do you think their friendship was forbidden?
Besucase when they were older the Hound would have to hun the Fox?
What was your favorite scene from the movie?
When they play and the song Best of Friends plays.
What was the saddest scene for you?
When the owner of the Fox had to release him on the wild, I cried.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch 'Lilo & Stitch?'
Yes I did.  I really liked that movie.
It was, in my opinion, one of Disney's more underrated movies.
It was definitely under-appreciated.  Though I'm glad they managed to make a TV series out of it.
I loved the setting in Hawaii.  I also loved that Lilo was raised by her sister, who played the role of a single parent.
That really brought a new sort of complexity into the Disney world that we did not see in prior movies.
Exactly.  Disney is always so good at inclusion.
I also loved the friendship and family themes.
What was the word for 'family' that Lilo kept saying to Stitch?
Lilo would tell Stitch that "Ohana" meant family, and that family meant no one was left behind or forgotten.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wasn't Whoopi Goldberg in a Disney movie?
Yeah, she was in The Lion King. She was one of the hyenas.
Oh yeah, the really goofy one, right?
Yeah. Her name was Ed I think.
That sounds right. Who voiced Timon and Pumba in that?
I don't remember but it was a duo that did a bunch of stuff together.
Was one of them Nathan Lane?
Yeah! It was Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.
And Nathan Lane was the warthog right?
Yeah, that's right. Let's not forget Jonathan Taylor Thomas as young Simba.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What were your favorite Disney movies of 2016?
I really liked Finding Dory and Zootopia.
Why those two?
Well I loved Finding Nemo so I had to see Finding Dory. Zootopia was just awesome?
Do you recommend Zootopia for my family movie night?
Yes. Its great for all ages.
Awesome, I will rent a copy for my family movie night.
I think your kids will be pleased.
I hope so, in the past I've failed to show a good film.
You can never go wrong with Disney!
XXXXXXXXXXX
pocahontas is completely underrated. the movie, i mean. and the character!
you think so?
yeah, i do! more people need to watch it
why? the message isn't all that great, it's not very historically accurate...
the music is beautiful and does have a great message!
i guess you're right. protecting the earth is important these days
it's always been important. and how could you forget the iconic line: 'these white people are dangerous'?
okay, that's keeping it pretty real
the worst thing about the movies is john smith
but we can just ignore him, i guess
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Cars 3?
I caught it during a matinee.
I kind of thought it would be better than the second, but it's really not.
Yeah.  It's just kind of a bad franchise to be honest.
It just lacks the emotion of normal Pixar movies.
Nobody cares about talking cars.
Without Paul Newman, it also feels a bit incomplete.
Not to mention that the race car driving angle is played out.
At least the ride at Disneyland is cool.
I hope I can go someday!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The last few Disney movies haven't been that good.
Please tell me you didn't just say that!
I did and I meant it! Come on. Moana was the only decent flick.
What about Secret Life of Pets?
Literally put me to sleep.
Yikes, okay. Zootopia?
Cute, but they could have done better. Really pushed the envelope.
What's your all time favorite Disney movie, then, Mr. Snob?
Oliver & Company
You're ridiculous
XXXXXXXXXXX
So many people know Disney for their princess movies, but other ones are great as well.
I know what you mean. I really liked The Lion King, for instance.
Yes, that one is such a classic! I'd say it is one of my favorites, especially since James Earl Jones voices Mufasa.
Did you know that it is based on Shakespeare's play Hamlet?
I hadn't heard that before. But now that I think about it, it makes sense.
Yes, since his father Mufasa is dead and his uncle Scar tries to take over.
You know, I really enjoyed the sequels to The Lion King as well.
Which one did you like better, The Lion King 2 or The Lion King 1 1/2?
I liked The Lion King 1 1/2. Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious, and I like the whole concept of seeing their side.
Yeah, it was funny how it was like they were watching the movie with us.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like that movie with the blonde
Their is many movies with a blonde person
The one with the popular song
Hm?
The one about letting go
Oh you mean frozen
Yeah that movie is lovely
i like it
I want to watch it again
We can
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Are you a fan of disney movies?
Yeah I would say so.
Me too.
What is your favorite one?
That would have to be Aladdin.
I love that movie.
It really reminds me of my childhood.
Same here.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude have you seen Tarzan?
The old animated one or the new live action movie?
The new live action movie.
Oh yeah I saw it yesterday. I really liked the star cast too.
Who are the actors in it?
Alexandar Skarsgard as Tarzan , Margot Robbie as Jane and Christoph Waltz as Leon Rom . Oh Samuel L jackson was also there but I don't remember his character name.
Which character did you like the most?
Alexandar Skarsgard as Tarzan is picture perfect casting , I cannot think of anyone else to play Tarzan.
What was the story about?
It's different from the animated one , in this one Tarzan is already living with Jane in civilization but something happens that forces him to return to the jungle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Disney movie Blackbeard's Ghost?
No, I never saw that one. What's it about?
It's about a track coach who goes to a small town and stays at an old inn on the seashore that's haunted.
Really? Who stars in it?
Dean Jones plays as the coach and Peter Ustinov is the ghost of Blackbeard.
Oh, that sounds good. It's not scary is it?
No, it's a comedy. You know how some of the older Disney movies were really funny.
You're right they had some good ones.
No one has seen the ghost but he shows himself to the track coach and follows him around.
I'll have to try to find that and watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think so many of the Disney Princess always have a tragic back story?
Like Belle losing her mom?
Do not even get me started on her story.
Why not?
She is kidnapped, then falls in love. It is nuts.
Yeah, but he changes.
Not enough, he was going to kill her dad.
I think it is a beautiful film.
It is better than the girl from Tangled feeling bad for her actual kidnapper.
Ok, that is true that was a bit out there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have A Whole New World stuck in my head.
Is that the Disney song?
Yeah, that's the one from Aladdin.
That's one of my all-time favorite Disney Movies.
But which one is your favorite?
Fern Gully I think.
Fern Gully isn't actually a Disney film!
Really? I always thought it was!
Nope! My favorite is The Rescuers.
Oh my God, the little mice in that movie are so cute!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie Big Hero 6?
No I did not. Was it good?
Good? It was amazing!
What was so amazing about it?
The story line was great for one thing.
Oh yeah? What else?
The graphics were awesome and the characters were so diverse and funny.
I'm going to have to see this movie now.
You should. I wouldn't mind watching it again.
Awesome! Maybe we can watch it together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Escape to Witch Mountain.
An old Disney flick.  When was it released?
1975.
Who were the stars?
Kim Richards and ike Eisenmann played the kids.
Any big name stars?
Eddie Albert, Ray Milland, Donald Pleasence.
Cool.  What happens in the end?
The kids get to Witch Mountain and they leave, as they are really space aliens.
Very nice ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you heard the Japanese version of that song from Frozen?
No. No. No! Stop right there! I don't want to hear anything about any songs from Frozen!
Why not? The movie and those songs were amazing!
Do you have kids? Everywhere we go in the car, we're constantly playing that soundtrack. And we play the Blu-Ray at least once a week
Yea, that would probably wear on you after a while.
I don't think I'm ever going to want to "build a snowman" ever again.
Well, you have to admit, Disney really created an instant classic with that movie.
I don't care, in my book, that movie will never be as good as Lilo and Stitch.
Why do you say that?
There wasn't any singing in Lilo and Stitch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched the Littler Mermaid before?
I have ! The best part is when she used a fork as a comb
I wonder how she kept her hair so nice in and out of the water?
I know , people always talk about how perfect her hair was.
I liked the part when Jasper was stuck in the kitchen and the chef was trying to boil him
that part was funny. Ursula was awful, she had her own powers she should have left the mermaids alone
I know, that part when she had the dried up mermaids stuck in the ocean floor was sad and disturbing
ariel's dad could be scary as well, like when he destroyed her special place
I hated that part, he was trying to keep her safe though
I am glad that in the end she got to marry Eric and have her legs and still see her dad and family.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The seaweed is always greener, in somebody else's lake.
You dream about going up there, but that is a big mistake.
I love the Little Mermaid, its one of my favorite movies.
Oh, I know, I've seen it about 100 times. Ursula still gives me goose bumps.
What's your favorite song from the Little Mermaid?
"Look at this stuff.... isn't it neat.... wouldn't you think my collection's complete... "
That's my favorite song too.
I know all the songs from the movie, I love all of them
What's your favorite scene from the little mermaid?
The part where Scuttle explains the human tools all wrong... hilarious
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you know who your nose reminds me of?
this sounds offensive, but who?
Pinocchio from the disney movies
wow wasnt he the guy with the long nose?
yes, it would grow every time he lied
so you are saying my nose gets bigger when i lie?
no but you kinda look like him
well thanks for thinking i look like a puppet
dont take offense pinocchio just wanted to be a real boy
well i guess its pretty cool to be pinocchio cause he is famous
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the Disney movie 101 Dalmations?
Yes!  It is one of my favorites.
Me too, I think the dogs are so cute in it.
I agree, I've loved it since it was a child.
Did you hear about the new movie called Cruella?
Yes, I heard it's live action too.  I just can't get into those types of movies.
Yeah, it's so weird when you see a villain in a cartoon get a backstory movie in a live action flick.
I don't like villain backstories either.
Villains shouldn't be getting sympathy.  Plus, she killed dogs for her coat!
Exactly!  It's ridiculous!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the songs from Moana?
I just downloaded the soundtrack!
Me too! I love the song where Moana's dad is telling her that the island provides everything they could ever need.
I like that one too!
Did you see the movie too or just hear the songs?
I saw the movie! What was your favorite part?
When Moana collected shells in the ocean when she was a little girl, I loved that part!
Yeah me too! And then the ocean took her back to the beach so her dad wouldn't find out.
That part was really cute.
I wish I had a connection to the ocean like that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear there is a new Frozen movie coming out?
I know I can hardly wait.
My daughter is so excited.
Mine too.
Honestly I am excited to see something new
I know I have watched the first about 5000 times
It will be great to hear some new songs
Yes it will.
We will have to get the girls together to watch it.
Its a date.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe Disney releasing all its classic animation as live action?
Just a money making ploy.
Gotta be, 'cause their not that good.
I know. I just saw Beauty and the Beast.
I'm sorry.
Thats $20 and 2 hours I'll never get back!
They're doing the Lion King too.
Oh man! Ruining all my favorites.
John Favro is directing.
He did the Jungle Book too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of movies do you like?
I love watching disney movies
I do too
They are great to watch with the family
Yes thats so true
My kids can't get enough of them
Mine either, they even love the movies on the disney channel
The disney channel premiere ones?
Yes those
My kods like those alot too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No, I haven't.
Why not? I liked it.
I lost interest after the third one.
I guess they did change a lot of the characters, not everyone likes that.
Yeah, I like the dynamic between Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom.
Johnny Depp is pretty good though.
He is, but I'm not a huge fan. Him on his own is not enough to keep bringing me back.
He has enough fans to keep a major franchise going for over a decade though.
Yeah, a lot of girls are obsessed with him. He's aged very well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I was wondering if you've seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie yet?
No! I've been meaning to check it out, but the timing hasn't been right. Have you?
Yes! It was amazing and beautiful. I couldn't believe how much better it was than the original.
What was so different about it? I haven't even seen any ads for it, to be honest.
The Beast actually sings in this one. And the graphics are incredible!
I'm going to have to go see it in the theaters then, before they stop playing it.
I hope you do! It would be a shame not to.
It sounds like it. I did hear that Emma Watson made the perfect Beauty for the film.
She and Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Kevin Kline all did spectacular work on the film.
Ok, you've convinced me! I will see it this weekend, and if they're lucky, maybe I'll take the kids!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite princess movie by Disney?
I think I like Cinderella most of all.
Yes! I love how the animals help to turn her into a princess.
Helpful animals are so Disney.
Does she have a fairy godmother?
Probably! Most Disney princesses have fairy godmothers.
And she's the one who loses her shoe on the steps, right?
Of course. That's how Prince Charming finds her.
I really need to lose one of my shoes one night.
Maybe your Prince Charming will find you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need to watch steamboat willie
I wish their was a easy way to get those classics
I know you have to watch bad rips online
Pretty much
Because no way to buy them
So many lost to time it seems
Such a shame about it
I know
I want to find it though
Maybe one day
XXXXXXXXXXX
We will have to plan to see the new Frozen when it is out.
Definitely. We should take our kids.
You know mine loved the first one. They watched it so many times.
Ya so did mine.
I think they loved the music from the movie a lot.
I loved the music so I may have encouraged mine.
Ya I thought compared to some of the other songs they liked it was better.
I bet I could see Let It Go from memory.
I know that I could. Also the song Olaf sings.
Ya that is another one they really liked.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new live action Beauty and The Beast?
I haven't and have little interest, wouldn't want to potientialy tarnish the original one.
Why do you like the classic film so much?
What is there not to like? It has classic songs, great characters, even Angela Lansbury did one of the voices, you can't beat that.
Hmm maybe I need to watch it again.
If you watch it with the right mindset, you will realize that while the story may seem silly, it's relevant in real life.
In what way would it be relevant?
We'll look at the fact that Belle falls in love with The Beast, goes to show that there's more to loving someone than outwardly appearance.
Well I suppose that would be a good lesson to learn.
It really is and something a lot of us could learn from, here's to you Beauty and The Beast!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the original Disney Cinderella?
Oh yes, it was one of my favorites as a little girl.
Mine too!  I really love the part where the mice make the dress for Cinderella.
Yeah, that was awesome.  Bibbity, Bobbity, Boo!
Yes, and the depiction of the evil step sisters is great.
I know.  I sing along to all the songs in that movie.
I used to, too!  Now I hear my children singing it while they're watching it.
That's so funny.  Mine do the same thing.
It was really the classic love story.
It was the ultimate princess movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen cars 3?
No, but i need to
Im going today, it looks good
I was thinking about going this weekens, my kods want to see it so bad.
Mine too, they are crazy over lightening mcqueen
My kids are partial to mater
You cant beat an old pick up
Definitely not.
I hope your kids enjoy it.
Yours too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Simba's voice actor from The Lion King?
I think Matthew Broderick voiced him really well. Ditto for Jeremy Irons and Scar.
Yeah, Scar was a really great character. Disney made him a great villain.
What's your favorite The Lion King song?
Hmm. I think either "Be Prepared", or "I Just Can't Wait To Be King".
Yes, that's a really tough decision. But I really liked "Hakuna Matata".
Yeah, that's a really upbeat and happy song.
I agree. I rate The Lion King 5 stars out of 5!
Me too!
It's my favorite Disney movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It is weird to think of disney in terms of Star Wars , I always think of lucas studios.
Ya it is a little weird. You think disney you think animation first.
Yes like snow white, cinderella etc.
True. But as for disney's Star Wars movie I think they are really doing a great job.
I agree with you, Disney may have been more successful than the epsiode one 2000's set of star wars films.
Oh for sure, in terms of quality.
They went back to what people really loved. Such as storm tropers in suits not cgi.
Disney made the right call on that one for sure!
I guess I need to start connecting Disney more to Star wars, I am sure with more and more movies being put out by them won't be hard.
I think that is very true. You know disney is going to keep pumping them out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids was a crazy movie
I know, when they were lost in the lawn that was scary
I thought they would never get bigger again
same here, he was always making things
well the Dad was an inventor, that is what they do!
that is true , remember that cookie they found and ate pieces of?
wasn't there a part when they also ate the icing or filing
I think so, I bet that was good!
Maybe if we were smaller food would last longer
that is an interesting thought, being smaller so we have more food and eat less but it seems like more !
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana yet?
No, not yet, but I really want to! I'm waiting for the DVD.
I couldn't wait to see it. I love Lin Manuel Miranda.
I do too. I also like movies with strong female heroines.
You'll definitely like Moana then.
I think I will. I heard there's no love interest. Is that true?
Yep!
Awesome! I'll make sure to look out for the DVD release.
Let me know when it comes out, we'll watch together.
Great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just read that Disney is making another The Incredibles Movie.
Yes I heard about it but didn't know is it was just a rumor.
No it's not. It was one of my favorite Disney movie. My brother saw it a million times. He wanted to be Mr. Incredible
I did too! It was a cool family with superpowers.  I was Elastigirl. When is it coming out?
It's coming out June of 2018. And it will be in 3D
Oh Gosh, I hope I'n not the only adult without kids watching at the theater. Because I will not miss it.
We should make it a friends night out. I have to see it!
Lets do that! it will be less awkward for the other people there.
I wonder what it will be about. I just hope they can bring the same voice cast from the original movie.
Me too. It has to be better than the original, and knowing Disney movies, it will be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The movie UP made me cry !
same here, it was really sad how the old man was living alone
I wish a house would really float with balloons
so do I , that would be so much fun!
That little boy was also really cute, I liked how the movie ended
I know but like you said it was sad
The old man was so lonely and the boy really helped him
he did, everyone needs someone like that in their life
I know , older people can get so lonely at times
They can, that boy was a bright spot in the mans life, he missed his wife so much
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the live version of Beauty and the Beast?
No I have not seen it yet.
I thought it was great but still like the animated version better.
Really? Where there a lot of differences in the two?
Just a slight few, nothing too major I thought.
Who plays Belle again in the live version?
Belle was played by Emma Watson.
Oh, she seems like a perfect fit for the part.
If you have a chance to see it I would recommend it, I think you will enjoy the Beast who is quite handsome.
I think I will have to rent it although I hear it is quite long so I need to free up some time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi there.
Seen any disney movies lately?
Yeah.
What did you see?
I saw Aladdin on tv.
Cool.
What about you?
I saw Beauty and the Beast with my kids not too long ago.
Love that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who did you like most in Aladdin?
The genie of course.
I agree with you.
I love that movie. It is so exciting.
Yeah, the carpet, Abu, Jasmine, all are wonderful.
Did you like the story?
Yes, I thought Jafar being obsessed with getting the lamp was a great idea.
Did you think he would try to become a genie?
I had no idea. But, it was a great way to end the movie.
I agree. Aladdin was a great story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That's quite a movie collection you have there!
Thanks They are mostly all Disney movies.
Disney movies are still my favorites.
Mine too. " I watched them as a child, began purchasing DVD's for my daughter, and now my granddaughter is watching them.
Have you seen Moana?  It's wonderful!
Yes, and the girl who played Moana was wonderful.
She has a fantastic voice.  Did you see her sing her sing a duet with that little girl on the Ellen show?
I did!  They were both great, and the little one was so excited to be singing with the "real" Moana!
And I love seeing the Disney stars have such a good time interacting with their fans.
I'll have to remember to look for a copy for my collection next time I shop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the latest Disney movie you've seen?
I've seen Moana quite recently. I enjoyed it quite a bit.
Oh, I haven't had the chance to see Moana yet. What is the movie about?
The movie is based on stories from Polynesian mythology. It's about a little girl who goes on an epic journey to help restore the balance of nature on her island, with the help of a demigod called Maui.
What did you enjoy about the movie the most?
I think the best part of the movie was just watching Moana's perseverance through all of the difficulties she had to face. She never gave up.
Sounds like she will be a good role model for little girls everywhere.
I believe so. She is portrayed as a very strong, independent young woman who follows her heart and does the right thing.
I think I will check this movie out very soon.
You should. It also puts nature in focus, which is an additional element that really makes this movie worth watching.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which muses in Hercules was your favorite?
I am not sure wh the Muses were.
There were five, Calliopy, Clio, Thalia, Terpsichore and Melpomene. They were the muses of poetry, history, comedy, dance and tragedy.
I liked the shorter, fluffier one. She was spicy in personality.
That was Thalia, the muse of history.
Yes, that is the one. She was a mischievous one.
I think I liked Terpsichore the best. She taught Hercules to dance.
I bet that was a tough job!
Imagine if he stepped on your toes.
He would break them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I'd have to say Toy Story.
That is a great one.
I liked the second one but not the third.
I didn't see the third one.
It was okay, but they should've stopped at two.
Seems a lot of movies go overboard.
Woody and Buzz are classics.
They are good characters in the movie.
Buzz is my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the new Beauty and the Beast?
I liked it. It was neat to see an old favorite with live action.
I didn't think they changed much.
They didn't really. The songs and stuff were the same.
Belle was the inventor this time and they made a point of her being educated.
I missed the bookshop scene. The ladder that moved in the original was my favorite.
Yes, but it emphasized the difference so when she gets to the library at the castle, she is blown away.
I also really liked the Harry Potter Easter egg in the beginning
Who doesn't love a good Harry Potter reference?
I think Emma Watson did a really good job, but her role was still similar to Hermione.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could be any Disney character which character would you be?
I'd pick the princess from Frozen. The one with the ice powers.
That's a good choice. You get to be queen and you get cool powers. Who would you pick?
I would pick the Genie from Aladdin.
I'd forgotten about him. He's really powerful and he's really funny.
You could do almost anything you want if you were Genie.
Is there another character that you would like to be?
Hercules. I'd like to be a hero.
A lot of bad things happened to him in the myths. He's much happier in the movies.
Exactly. You get his powers but not the sad parts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite part from Frozen?
The let it go part
I love that song
What was yours?
Do you wanna build a snowman
That song was good too
It was kind of sad, but fun
Exactly
It was a great movie
Yes i agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they will ever make any Alladin sequels?
I do not, not with Robin Williams being gone.
I liked the second Alladin.
The one called Prince of Thieves?
Yep, where he meets his dad.
And they have to save the world, bu stealing.
And there is an island on the back of a turtle, for some reason.
I liked the way Iago turned into a good guy in that movie.
I did too. Jafar was the real reason he was bad .
Jafar was really good at being bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?
Of course! It's one of my favorite movies of all time.
Do you think you would like to live in the castle with all the furniture talking to you?
Yeah, that would be awesome, Cogsworth and Lumiere would be my best friends.
What about The Little Mermaid? have you seen that one?
Dude, I can sing all the songs.
That's awesome, how about the Lion King?
Well of course, I know all about that one, too. Simba and Rafiki and Mufasa.
Hakuna Matata
It means no worries.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was watching a PBS documentary about Disney last night.
Oh yeah? Did you like it?
Yes. It showed clips of the different movies and saw clips of Dumbo.
Oh, I loved Dumbo!
He was so darned cute with those big eyes.
And he never spoke a word of dialogue in the whole movie.
True. Proof that emotions can be conveyed just through body language and eyes ... even when animated.
Dumbo is a little unusual as far as a Disney movie goes.
How so?
Most have a father raising a motherless child, but in Dumbo his mother was raising a fatherless child.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know they're making the Incredibles 2?! It comes out in 2018.
Really? No way! They waited 14 years, and just now they're making a sequel?
Yep. How do you think it'll turn out?
Hmm, I'm not sure. Hopefully better than the first.
What do you mean? The first one was pretty good!
Yeah, but there were a lot of hidden mature jokes.
Humph. Typical Disney.
Yeah. Well, I hope it'll have good ratings.
I can't wait to watch it!
Me either!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does Princess Elena of Avalor have her own movie?
I don't think so. I think her and Sofia the First were the first two to be introduced on a television show instead.
Elena wasn't even introduced on her own show though!
Really?
Yeah! At least I think so. She was introduced on a tv movie with Sofia the First.
Oh, right. Sofia visits Avalor on vacation.
And releases her from her amulet!
I hope she gets her own movie. My daughter loves Elena of Avalor.
Mine too. The characters are great and I love all the music in the episodes.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Disney movie "Moana"?
Yes! I loved it, what did you think?
It was good. I liked the tropical setting and thought the characters were pretty interesting.
Yeah, me too. I really liked those little coconut guys, what were they called again?
Kakamoras!
Yes, that's it. They were too cute, and I loved that song they sang.
The movie was full of great songs. Disney movies usually are though.
Ain't that the truth. Every time I go and see a new Disney movie, I end up humming the songs for days!
I hope they make a sequel to "Moana," I thought there was more story to tell.
Yeah, that would be great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
We should go see a movie today.
That's a great idea. Are there any Disney movies playing?
Why Disney?
I've just been in the mood for one.
Hmm, well, it doesn't look like it right now.
Could we just rent one then?
Sure! What would you like to rent.
Either Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.
Let's do Aladdin then!
Okay!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hard to believe The Pacifier is a Disney film.
That does not surprise me one bit.
Why would you think that?
I mean think about the title.
I guess you could say that.
The Rock didnt do a bad job with it either.
He played a funny role.
It was a bit campy in all fairness.
Yeah I can see where you would say that.
An action movie centered around a babys pacifier is not believable either
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe it's been twenty years since Hercules came out in theaters.
I know, it seems like time has flown by since then. I remember seeing it when it came out.
Me, too. I liked Danny DeVito's character in it, the satyr.
I think my favorite part was when the little kid is in trouble and his friend says, "Someone call IXII!"
Oh, yeah! Except wasn't that not really kids, but a trap by Hades?
True. It was his two little sidekicks, Pain and Panic.
Right. That was when Hercules was still trying to get some fame.
Yes, trying to defeat the Hydra.
Before he went from "zero to hero."
Nice. I like that song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the new Nemo movie.
Finding Dory?
Yes, with Ellen Degenres.
I thought it was so cute!
I loved the way they showed her family.
The dad, even as a fish, some how managed to look as if he had a receding hairline.
A receding fin line.
It was also kind of sad.
I cried when it showed the flash back to her family.
I was glad it ended on a high note though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There are so many good Disney animated films, but Mary Poppins is my favorite.
Oh, mine too! Julie Andrews is perfect.
So is Dick Van Dyke.
I agree. They make such a cute couple in that film.
Did you know they're making a sequel?
I had no idea!
Yes, it's called Mary Poppins Returns. I think Emily Blunt is staring in it.
Oh wow. She will be amazing, I'm sure.
Yes. But nothing can really compare to the original.
No way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Disney movie is coming out this year?
Coco is coming out in november.
Cool, what is this movie about?
It is about a kid who wants to become a musician but his family doesn't allow it .
Sounds intriguing , anything else?
I saw the trailer recently , the boy plays a guitar and is transferred to a new world .
So who are the voice actors in that ?
The two main characters are played by Gael García Bernal  as Hector & Anthony Gonzalez as  Miguel.
Where is the movie set?
By the looks of the trailer it seems the movie in set in mexico.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
Dead Men Tell No Tales - yes!  I loved it.
I've loved all the Pirates movies, but I was glad to see some of the old characters back again.
No kidding - I loved seeing Will turner again!
Yes!  I just wish that Elizabeth Swan would have had some dialog.  I hope that there will be some more sequals.
I had heard that this was supposed to be the last one, but that it may be a multi movie finale.
I just hope that Barbossa isn't really dead.  He's one of my favorite characters.
Well, I was thinking about that too.  He died in the first movie but Tia Dalma brought him back, so maybe he isn't dead again.
I like Tia Dalma - I liked her better than the new witch in this movie.
I agree - I loved the Tia Dalma/Calypso/Davy Jones themes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Holes is a movie all about luck, wouldn't you say?
What do you mean?
Well, luck comes into every single part of that movie.
What's an example?
Like bad luck when Zero throws those shoes on Stanley Yelnats' head.
Yeah I guess so.
And good luck when they come across that water and onions on God's thumb after climbing the mountain.
That also was about luck I guess.
In the end, Stanley and Zero got all good luck basically.
And Mr. Sir got TERRIBLE luck. Haha
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the romance scene in Lady in the Tramp?
Yes, that is so memorable.
I really liked that movie
Yeah, I wish they made more like that one.
Those Disney films that were made in the 40's and 50's were so good.
I agree. There were many classics.
Who do you like the most in Lady and the Tramp?
I like Jock.
He is so funny.
Yeah, I love him and his friend. That movie is amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Finding Nemo?
Yes, I did. In fact I watch it all the time with my children.
Do your children enjoy watching Finding Nemo?
Yes, they can't get enough of it.
Did you guys see Finding Dory?
Not yet.
Why not?
I have not purchased it yet.
I think your children would love it.
I bet they would!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so excited to see that Toy Story has a new movie coming out.
Oh really! I didn't know that.
Yeah it doesn't come out until 2019 but I'm super excited.
Are they keeping with the original cast?
Yes. So far Tim Allen and Tom Hanks willbe taking their roles.
Oh now I'm excited! I wonder what this one will be about.
It's suppose to be about Buzz and Woody going to rescue Bo Peep and bring her home.
Well we will have to go see that in theater for sure. I'm so glad they are keeping with the classics.
I know I love being able to share my childhood favorites with my own family.
I hope they keep going with the Toy Story movies, so more generations can grow up with true classics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what is a shame
What is that
They stop making some movie series
Like what
Well Disney pixar had a few they stopped
What one
Well i have been waiting for a monsters INC sequel for years
I think its dead jim
Yeah i am sure it is
Shame though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch disney movies
Yes
What do you like?
I really liked another cinderella story
With selena gomez?
Yes
That was a good one
It was a good twist from regular Cinderella
It was good
The best
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Cinderella and felt so good about the story.
Oh! I know the very old prose and tale is now so much live.
I have been thinking and finding magic in life like that.
I too believe it happens.
Could it happen to us, what happened to Cinderella and the Prince?
It may I feel but I know little about the magic.
Cinderella found her prince, and they were happy.
Yeah, every good work has a happy ending.
It really takes a lot of effort to reach happiness.
I am sure I believe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you sen the new Cars movie yet?
No I haven't, but I can't wait to see it!
It looks really good, Lightening McQueen has a new rival.
Do you think they're going to have more of Mater in it?
I think I saw Mater in the preview.
My kids think Mater is the best part of the movies.
Mater is funny, but I don't think he was that special.
Well, obviously a lot of people liked Mater because Cars 2 was mostly just about him!
That's true. The new one is supposed to be about Lightening McQueen and a new character named Cruz.
Is Cruz supposed to be his new rival?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you realize that there is almost never a mother in Disney movies?
What do you mean, there is a mom and dad in Inside Out?
True, but what in Finding Nemo, the mom dies in that movie?
Ok, that true and there is no mom in The Little Mermaid either.
Yep, and in Beauty and the Beast we never see Belle's mom at all.
Yeah, I don't even know if she is supposed to be dead or what.
I think so. And there's the classics of course.  Cinderella doesn't have a mom.
Yeah and neither does Snow White.
And we can't forget the biggest one - Bambi.
Well, technically Bambi had a mom for a little while during the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your least favorite Disney movie?
It has to be Pocohontas
Really? Why?
The story is really weak, i don't like that Pocohontas was turned into a love story where she falls in love with John Smith
But didn't you like the villan? Ratcliffe is very funny
I felt the humor from Ratcliffe and his dog to be very lacking
Well what about the songs?
I actually do like Color of the Wind
What about the other songs?
Around the River bend is catchy too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Toy Story a Disney movie?
Yes, it was made my Pixar and Disney owns them.
Cool, did you hear they are making a fourth one?
Yes, I did.
I Hope it is as good as part 1.
Me too.
Do you think Buzz and Woody will be in it?
Of course. They are the main guys.
Do you think John Lasseter will direct it?
Probably.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Meet the Robinsons is a very good but underrated film.
I completely agree. I love the message that u cannot focus on yesterday but look to tomorrow.
Exactly, it's something that people should do more
I love how the characters are so wacky and crazy.
And they are so fun you just want to keep watching more!
Did you know that it is based off a book?
No, I had no idea. What is the book called
A Day with Wilbur Robinson by William Joyce. You should read it, I bet you'll like it a lot.
I think I will check it out. I'm interested to see how the two compare.
You can get it for your Kindle on Amazon if you want.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Disney films have been around for almost 100 years now?
Wow, has it really been that long?
It's been 95 years this year since Walt Disney made a short film called Alice's Wonderland in 1923.
I wonder if he had any idea what would happen in the future.
I'm sure there's no way he could have known. He may have been thinking maybe he would make a dozen or two pictures and be successful, but probably couldn't comprehend how far it would go.
Now there's not only the movies and cartoons, but Disneyland and Disney World, two of the biggest vacation attractions in the country.
Walt Disney made over 600 films himself, and then the franchise continued.
Think how many people he has entertained over the years.
I can't wait to see in a few years what kind of celebration they have for the 100 year anniversary.
Maybe they'll create a special Disney movie just for that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Hercules one of Disney's worst films?
I think the animation was bad.
The characters look like every other movie.
I know but it was just off.
I think it did terrible at the box office.
I have never seen it replayed.
I think the storyline was not that good.
Most kids dont understand what they were talking about.
One of the few Disney movies I will only watch one.
I am one of them too, so count me in!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the latest remake of Beauty and the Beast?
No, I really dislike Emma Watson.
Me too! Plus the animated Disney version is much more fun.
It is. It's a nice little story about love conquering demons, right?
I guess so. Love taming the best within.
Everyone could probably use a bit more love then.
You've got that right. We're all beasts at heart.
I just want to have talking tableware.
Yes! The singing teapot is amazing.
A singing teapot would certainly make mornings better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to get my great nephew started on watching animated Disney films.
Because you love them yourself?
Yes. I grew up on them, I brought my niece to most of them now I want to show her son how great they are.
I know what you mean, it's a right of passage.
I may start with 101 Dalmatians. He loves puppies.
And Dalmatians are the cutest!
It's a fun movie, I'd want him to see live version with Glen Clse also, But when he's older. She was so good it was scary!
That is true. She really chewed up the scenery didn't she?
She's a great actress.
Let me know how your great nephew likes it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Disney movie is Hercules.
Oh, I love that one!
The sense of humor is excellent.
I love Kuzco.
He is so funny.
The music in it is nice too.
Yeah I feel like it's under appreciated
For sure. I also like Alladin for the humor
Robin Williams is fantastic.
I wish he did more voiceovers for Disney movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for Incredibles 2 to come out.
Me either but I don't even know a release date.
I know! It's just so hard to wait for something so great.
I heard that frozone not going to be in the movie.
What are you talking about. You can't do the incredibles 2 without frozone.
That's what I was saying but you never know.
Disney comes out with great movies
I know but the incredibles have got to be the best.
Your right about that.
I know I am.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you feel about moana?
I liked that she was a modern day girl but the story was still in the past.
Yea, she didn't even have a love interest in the movie.
I wish the pig was the main sidekick instead of Hei Hei.
I agree. I loved the music in it. I think Lin Manuel Miranda did really good with the songs.
Yea. Did you hear he was going to be in the new Mary poppins movie.
Yea. I wonder if he is helping with the soundtrack again or just acting.
I heard that he's helping with that soundtrack and acting.
I think he signed a deal with Disney to work on multiple soundtracks in the future.
I guess kind of like Phil Collins did Tarzan and brother bear.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer animated Disney movies or live action ones.
Either one but I like the older ones in both categories.
So do I. The classics are great.
I don't like all this computer animated stuf.
A few of the movies using that are OK but I agree for the most part.
They lack the magic and innocence of the older movies. They're too glitzy and flashy.
Yes, I definitely see that.
I used to watch Disney movies and the Disney channel all the time but now I never do.
It's all teen comedy now.
It's not funny eiter. The teens mostly have attitude problems.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Disney making all the classics with live people?
I am not sure. I mean I LOVE the orginals!
They did the Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast so far and they have done well.
I agree but it feels like they are just trying to make some easy money.
I heard they are going to do Aladin.
I heard that too. I don't think they should because Robin Williams is the only person who can play Genie.
I agree that he made the entire movie.
It is hard to do that now with him being dead.
Well maybe they will find an acceptable replacement.
No one can fill his shoes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Disney prince?
I'm not even sure I can think of any of the princes' names.
Yeah, they don't get as popular as the princesses do.
That's true.  I did like Prince Charming.
Yeah, always a classic to go with the guy from Cinderella.
He always wore such formal clothes.
Any other princes that you liked?
What about the one from Princess and the Frog?
Oh, I can't even think of his name.
Didn't he spend half the movie as a frog?  That's probably why we can't remember him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wreck it Ralph is one of my favorite recent Disney movies. Did you know part 2 is coming out next year?
Really? I didn't know but im glad you told me. I love that little girl character. she is voiced by Sarah Silverman
Who? Vanellope von Schweetz. She has spunk.
Yes, that is what I love about her.
I also heard James Corden from the Late Late Show will be voicing one of the characters. He is really funny, don't you think so?
Yes he is. Jane Lynch is hillarious and she will voice Sergeant Calhoun
Yes I heard. If the movie is just like the first one, it will be a blast.
I'm so excited to see it.
I can't wait to go with my kids to see this movie. November 21st of 2018 can't come soon enough.
We should plan on going together. It will be fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The scene where Mufasa dies in The Lion King is always so sad.
I know, it makes me cry everytime even though I know what's going to happen.
He's just such a great character.
And James Earl Jones does such a good job playing him.
Also, I just really feel for Simba--thinking you hurt your own family...how terrible.
On the other hand, the scenes with Timon and Pumba are so funny!
No doubt--Hakuna Matata is such a good song for cheering yourself up.
I also find Rafiki hilarious.
Which one is he?
The baboon, silly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like science fiction moviesi?
Yes! I am a nerd so they are my favorite genre.
Do you like Disney movies?
Not really. Like I said before, sci-fi is my thing.
Do you like Star Wars?
Yes! They are a classic.
But, you said you don't like Disney movies.
That's right!
Did you know Star Wars Rouge One is distributed By Walt Disney Studios?
What! No way! I take back everything I said.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Meet the Robinsons?
That was such a cute movie. It reminds me of The Incredibles.
I'd have to say that's my favorite Disney movie.
Mine is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
You know I've never actually seen the original Snow White.
Oh you have to see it, it's a classic.
I've never seen Bambi either.
Well that's not so bad. You didn't have to be traumatized as a kid like everybody else.
Someone shot Bambi's mom right?
Yes and left a scar on children forever and ever. Cinderella is another good Disney classic
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Silly as it sounds it has to be the Lion King.
That is a classic, I know a lot of people who love that movie.
We watch it all the time at my house. Even though I have seen it a million times I still cry when Mufasa dies.
I don't think it would make me cry but that part is sad when Simba is left all alone.
At least he finds Timon and Pumbaa to help him and show him family.
My favorite part is when they sing Hakuna Matata, Disney movies always have the best soundtracks.
I agree. The music makes the movie, it wouldn't be the same without it.
I love how they did the Lion King 1 1/2 it was funny from Timon and Pumbaa's point of view.
Yeah, it was funny seeing things from their perspective instead of the lions side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the new Beauty and the Beast?
Like, does it compare to the original? I'm not sure.
I think it's got its own appeal. But the animated one will always be classic.
I agree. I think I still know all the words to the songs!
I definitely know all the words. Who can forget them?
Yeah, when Belle is dancing with the Beast and Mrs. Potts is singing.
Just thinking about it makes me feel nostalgic.
I should see the new one! Just to see if it compares.
Yeah, go see it and let me know what you think.
Will do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Bambi?
Yes! I loved that movie.
I used to watch it all the time as a child.
It was so sad when Bambi's mother dies.
I agree, I will never forget about that scene.
Disney movies normally don't have such sad scenes.
I think it was an important scene in the plot.
I do too, and I am glad it was included.
I can't wait to watch Bambi with my own kids one day.
I think I will watch it with my kids tonight!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I'd have to say Pocahontas.
Really, out of all the movies? Why?
I just really like the story and her sidekick raccoon.
My favorite part of that movie is the talking willow tree.
Yeah! She was so wise.
I wonder if they will ever remake that movie.
I'm not sure, maybe they will do a live version.
I can't see a remake being as good as the original.
Honestly, neither can I.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tomorrowland was a great movie.
I liked it as well. I thought the acting by George Cloony and Hugh Laurie was great.
Yes Hugh played the villain perfectly.
The little boy who played Cloony as a child easily could have passed as him.
Yes it was definitely cast well.
And the little girl who was the robot was fantastic. She had a great personality and was so athletic.
I loved the depiction of Tomorrowland as an actual place.
Yes it was a place that I wish was real.
I have a Tomorrowland button and sometimes I touch it to see if something happens.
Ha ha! I do the same. Nothing ever happens though sadly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love to watch animated Disney films.
I do too. They make me feel good.
They give you a sense of something steady.
Yes like the movie Bambi makes me remember childhood.
For me it's Alice in Wonderland.
Disney has really made an impact on the family movie going experience.
I agree whenever there is a new movie out I go to see it.
I usually make it an event.
We plan our day around the movie.
I think that's a great idea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to pick, who would be your favorite Disney prince?
Oh, easily Eric from The Little Mermaid.
He's pretty dreamy - but I like Flynn Rider from Tangled.
But he wasn't a prince until he married Rapunzel!
In that case I guess my favorite is Prince Adam from Beauty and the Beast.
He seems like a good choice.
I wonder if Kuzco from the Emperor's New Groove counts as a Disney prince.
Not sure, but if he does I'd switch my vote.
"Pull the lever, Kronk!"
"Wrong lever!"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Judy Hopps is a true feminist
really?
yeah, zootopia is about feminism! it's also about equal rights for people of color
you really think disney is that deep?
yeah, i do! they always have been. the proof is in the pudding
i guess it does have a lot of scenes that could be about feminism, but it seems more about believing in yourself
don't the two go hand in hand?
i guess...
the reason more women don't believe in themselves is because we don't have enough feminism!
so i guess it's a good thing we have judy hopps
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
I would have to say The Lion King.
What a great movie. What did you like most about it?
That it was a story about a boy facing terrible circumstances and defying the odds while becoming a man.
Wow, that's pretty deep.
What did you like about it?
The fight between Simba and Scar.
Yea, that was a good fight, what did you think about Simbas dad dying?
What a sad scene, too bad he couldn't Mufasa hahaha!
Wow, you're a terrible person.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you read the story The Little Mermaid was based on?
No, I haven't.
Lucky, it's so sad! The Disney movie is way more upbeat.
Oh, well it makes sense that they changed it for a kid's movie then.
Yeah, in the original story she dies.
Who dies?
Ariel! She goes to heaven, though.
Oh yeah, thank goodness they changed it. That would never have worked.
Yeah, and it worked out for the best. I love The Little Mermaid.
Me too. Part Of Your World is a classic karaoke number.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you go and see the new live action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast?
Yes I did, it was amazing.
I agree. What was your favorite part?
It has to be the music.
I agree. All the dancing and singing parts were done so well.
The costumes in all of those scenes were insane! I loved them so much.
Oh I did too. Dan Stevens as the Beast was incredible. His costume was by far the best.
I agree, but we can't forget about Gaston.
You're right. Luke Evans as Gaston was really cool.
I agree, and so was Emma Watson as Belle. I love her as an actress.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Cars 3 is coming out this weekend or next.
Are you going to see it? Cars is my least favorite Pixar movie ever.
I'd say Cars 2 is worse than Cars, but yeah, it's definitely on their low end of the quality scale.
This one seems to be getting better reviews, though.
True, but with how good Toy Story 2 and 3 were, you'd think they would be better at sequels.
Agreed. Monsters University wasn't the best film either.
I have strong faith in The Incredibles 2, though -- there's no way they can mess that up.
Especially with the current trend of superhero films.
So, we're skipping Cars 3 and waiting for the next Pixar movie?
Sounds good to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If Walt Disney were still alive, he would have been really proud of "Frozen".
Definitely, with the beautiful animation and memorable songs.
Did you know they created a whole new software just to animate Elsa's braids?
That's dedication!
I've always loved the colorful, surreal animation in Fantasia.
Me, too, especially the Vivaldi "Four Seasons" section.
Who do you think should play Mary Poppins in the sequel?
Why not Lady Gaga?  She sung "Sound of Music" songs so beautifully when she presented the award to Lady Gaga.
One of my favorite surprises for an attraction at Disney World was the comedy show for Monsters, Inc.
I liked it, too!  It was like a Disney version of Don Rickles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the remake of Disney's The Jungle Book?
You mean the new live action version?
Yeah, that's the one I'm talking about.
I didn't like it as much as the original.
Why didn't you like it?
The music wasn't nearly as good as in the first one.
Yeah I mean, maybe you're right. There was like only two songs afterall.
Right. Also the giant monkey freaked me out in the newer version! So Scary!
Hahaha. That's funny because I thought the same thing.
Yeah his temple was really scary.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Moana is something else, isn't it.
Isn't it! I don't... totally know how to take the Pacific Islander thing, because that's not my culture so I don't know what they might be stomping all over, but as a movie it's just delightful.
Yeaahh... now that you mention it. I wonder how all of that goes over.
I mean. It's a Disney movie; it's going to be laced with all that neoliberal imperialist garbage, in the name of multiculturalism.
Yeah. And I'm not sure what culture, exactly, this is supposed to represent -- just a cross-section?
I dunno; a bunch of the proper names are familiar enough. Maui, Te Fiti (Tahiti)...
That's... curious. Does this work as sort of... a made-up origin legend for a bunch of existing mythology, like, I dunno, The Wind Waker?
Ohh, that's a comparison to make. But, I don't know and I haven't researched.
Anyway, put a pin in that and... as a movie, it's so... it makes me feel so optimistic.
Yeah, the character development -- that's probably the ticket. Moana feels like someone you can try to be, in your life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Disney movie as a kid?
The Lion King.
I love that movie.
Yeah Scar was scary and ruthless.
But a good character.
But who could forget Timone and Pumba?
Those guys were so funny.
James Earl Jones as Mufasa was great.  His voice has so much power.
I know.  And the baboon was funny.
How could I forget the baboon?
XXXXXXXXXXX
wich are you oldest memories?
i think the little mermaid movie
what do you remember about that movie?
maybe the scene with the crab
can you be more specific?
there was a catchy song with the crab
it was the "under the sea song"
yeah that was it
i remember that too
its a good memory
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wreck it Ralph s my son's favorite movie
my kids also like that movie, the mouse is kind of gross though
I know, if I saw a mouse I would try to trap it
so would I! But it was funny how he rode around in the car
that hotel was so nasty, it was infested with mice
I would not have wanted to stay there
remember they did not have a choice because their car broke down ?
That is right, I think it was also raining pretty hard
I bet that hotel smelled really old and like mold
it probably did, I hope they did not have to stay for long, the poor boy was so bored he had to play with a mouse!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the last Star War?
you mean the one that came out in 2015?
You mean The Force Awakening?
yea
I remember that movie as if it just came out yesterday, it's been such a long time
indeed, and I'm so glad they're making so many more, we're blessed!
you know there is one coming out this year?
about time! It's been 2 years, I want to see it badly.
Yes, I want to see Luke Skywalker back on the field
me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Zootopia?
Yes, that was an excellent movie!
I agree.  It seems like they set up for a sequel.
Do you know when that is coming out?
I just looked and it may be coming out in 2021.
That is so far away!  Why would they make us wait so long?
It's unfortunate because there aren't a lot of other animated movies that seem really good coming out in the upcoming future.
Cars 3 is out, I'm excited to see that.
I'm not a big fan of the Cars series, so I don't much care about that.
Well, I will go see it without you then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know The Incredibles is coming out with a sequel?
Yes but have to wait till July 2019.
I almost did not watch this movie as I was not impressed with how they looked.
Too bad, had you skipped and missed this movie.
I am super excited for the sequel as the story ended with the whole family joining in the act.
It was really funny and interesting especially the youngest's actions.
I remember the mom took pains to keep her kids away from all the super powers and adventures.
But that proved to be fruitless when the family got in trouble.
It was satisfying to watch the family fight to save each other.
It was super entertaining. I hope the sequel goes beyond and does its best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the Hunchback of Notre Dame by Disney?
Yes it is pretty good although it is a very loose translation of the actual story.
I think Quasimoto was a great character.
I liked Quasimoto but the gargoyles were my favorite.
Why the gargoyles?
Because as with all Disney sidekicks they usually have the funniest quips and quotes.
I liked visual aspect too.
The animators did a fantastic job on the whole project.
The colors were so vibrant.
I thought the church's details were so realistic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Cars movies?
I saw the first one and the second one but I don't think I will see the third.
Why don't you think you will see it?
I really wasn't that impressed with the second one.  I didn't like it at all.
The first one was pretty good.  The spy storyline in the second one was a little bit far fetched for me.
The trailer for the third movie looked pretty intense though.  I heard it scared a bunch of kids.
Yeah it only shows Lightning McQueen crashing and that's it.
I think they are bringing back most of the characters from the first one  though.
I know they are bringing back Doc, which should be interesting.
I heard that it will be about Lightning getting older and trying to compete with younger cars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Flubber with Robin Williams?
Yeah I seen that long time ago though.
I just watched it again recently and it was just as funny as when it first came out.
Oh I bet, even though it seems so different since Robin passed away though.
What was your favorite parts of the movie?
I love the basketball game scene, if only we could actually have our very own Flubber that would be so cool.
Do you think it is actually possible for that kind of thing to actually happen though?
I'm sure it could happen if they have the right equipment and funding.
What did you think about the ending with the wedding?
I thought that was cute and then flying off in the car was just awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Disney will ever make another Inside Out movie?
I hope so. That movie was hilarious.
The imaginary friend cracks me up every time.
You mean Bing Bong? I forget the actor who voiced him.
His name is Richard Kind. He used to be on that TV show Spin City.
He's funny. That was a good casting choice for Bing Bong.
I think they did a good job on all the characters, to be honest.
I agree. Who was the gentleman that voice Anger?
That would be Lewis Black. He's a comedian.
He's great. He's my favorite Inside Out character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Pirates of the Caribbean The Black Pearl?
Was that the 1st one?
Yes I think so, When they find Will Turner as a boy?
Yes that was probably the best one.
I loved that movie with Johnny Depp.
Did you see the new one that just came out?
No not yet, but I want too.
Me too. I don't know how good it's going to be though.
It's going to be good, just because Jack Sparrow is the main pirate.
Yes that's who I like to see the most.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie from your childhood?
I would have to say The Fox and The Hound.
Oh, I loved that movie too! Todd the fox was so cute!
He was. It was actually a really emotional movie for me, and still is!
I know, I love watching Disney movies from my childhood now that I'm an adult. I catch all sorts of things I missed when I was a kid.
I know! It's like watching the movie for the first time again.
The part where Todd and Copper rescue the old dog gets me every time.
That movie does teach kids a lot about compassion.
It does. I feel like a lot of Disney movies have great teaching tools like that.
They really do. I'm glad we grew up with them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Lion King with my kids the other day. I think it is one of the best Disney movies ever!
Well I have to agree with you there. I love that movie, plus the music is great!
I just find the plot so interesting. It is entertaining to kids and makes adults think a little bit.
For sure. Like how Mufasa is not really gone from Simba, even if he has passed away.
I think it speaks to how we carry loved ones in our heart after they've passed on.
But really, the best part is the music!
Oh definitely, I sometimes catch myself singing Hakuna Matata.
That's a good one, plus the song that everyone loves-Can You Feel The Love Tonight.
It is a classic. Plus, my daughter loved that storyline of Simba and Nala reuniting during the song.
The love story within the plot is definitely a plus.
XXXXXXXXXXX
you know the part in mulan when they find out she's a girl?
yeah, i do!
that's a really deep part. they literally throw her in the snow!
and she's injured, yeah. that is pretty terrible
they only did it because she was a woman. when she was a man, a wounded war vet they were taking care of her
people don't care about women
they don't. they really don't
she's the best fighter in the team, too
i guess it's fine. by the end of the movie they realize
and then she kicks butt, yeah!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I kind of wish they would remake Mulan with real people like they did for Beauty and the Beast.
That would be such a great remake!
I agree!  There are some great actors and actresses they could choose from.
And think about the set if they were able to actually shoot in China!
The family's home and the Emperor's castle would look so cool.
It definitely would.  Can you imagine what casting would be like though?
I'd love to see who they would cast as Chien-Po, Mulan's grandma, and her mom.
How about Li Shang?  And Mulan herself?
Honestly, they could probably cast Lea Salonga as Mulan and she'd still be just as great as she was when she was the voice for the original.
Agreed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Walt Disney had so many feature animated movies , which do you like best?
Well I don't think walt himself worked on my favorite one.
Well the Disney company then, which one do you pick?
Tarzan. I loved Rosie O'Donnell as Terk.
She was really perfect for this role. Her voice was so spunky and cute.
I really find the strength of Tarzan was the acceptance by the mother.
That is a heartwarming theme. I think the music is also one big strength of the film.
"You'll Be in My Heart,"makes me cry almost everytime I hear it,
Phil Collins is a great musician. I think all his songs in this film are superb.
Phil is a legend. he performed the songs and was also the narrator on the film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you now what one of my favorite Travolta movies is?
Is it Faceoff?
No. It's Bolt.
What is that?
A cute Disney movie where he is the main character. A dog.
Really. I never saw it.
It's so cute.
How old is that movie?
It's from 2008.
I wonder if my daughter has it. I'll have to look.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Finding Nemo really helped me get into the Disney scene.
Why did it take so long?
I just never liked animation.
But what did you like it specifically?
Seeing the journey that they go on and how it takes different turns.
I know what you mean.
Yeah so I thought Ellen DeGeneres did a wonderful job as Dory.
She got her own film because of it.
I did not see it
Neither did I, but we all know it was out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you here about the new Frozen movie?
No I haven't heard anything about it.
I heard they are coming out with a sequel.
Oh, really.  My kids will be excited.
Yes mine will too, all except Bobby.  He hates those kinds of movies.
Well who wouldn't love to see Ana and Elsa?
Bobby says if he has to hear Do you want to build a snowman one more time he'll throw up.
HaHa that's Emily's favorite song of all time.
HaHA Jessica and Mariah love that song too.
We'll have to plan to take the girls and leave Bobby home with his dad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movie are you looking forward to?
Big Hero 7
Really? They're making a sequel to Big Hero 6. That would be awesome
Yeah, apparantly they don't have a definitive release date yet though.
Bummer, guess something I will have to keep an eye out for. Any idea of the details?
I read that Tadashi apparantly makes a miraculous comeback as a villan
That's absurd! First off he is dead, and secondly he's the creator of Beymax, who was designed to help people.
I'm not sure, although didn't Tadashi's brother, Hiro have a stent in the first movie where he became a bit of a villan himself?
Well sort of, it was more "vigilante justice" but not "villan" as in harming innocent people.
Sometimes they are classified one in the same, not sure how Tadashi will be classified in this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So have you seen "Finding Nemo"?
No I haven't. Is it any good?
Are you kidding me?! It was AMAZING! One of the cutest movies I have ever seen.
Oh yeah?
Seriously. I know it isn't you thing per say, but the turtles in that movie you would love! There is a scene where they meet the turtles, hey are surfers and he calls him "Mr.Turtle" and the turtle responds "My dad was Mr.Turtle, you can call me Crunch" it was hilarious!
So they have surfing turtles?
Yes and the little one is great! Oh and Dori, the fish with no memory.
Don't all fishes have no memory?
I guess? But seriously you have to see it, I really can't do it justice.
I'll check it out some time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think disney most popular movie is?
Hard to say do you mean for me personally or overall ticket sales and profits?
Well now I am curious on both aspects.
For highest profit I think it would now be frozen.. but not sure.
Ah yes that would makes sense , it was so wildly popular.
For me personally I think Lion King. It was crazy popular when it came out as well.
Ya Lion King was good. I love J.T.T. at the time.
You and every other young girl. He was good for the role. His voice was very fitting.
I don't know how played scar, or voiced him rather but his vocals were also a perfect fit.
Scar was such a good character. Lion King had so many good characters and songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
Hmm, I don't know, they're all so good!
If you had to pick one or two, though
Well, maybe the one with the three witches
And the glass slippers?
I think that's the one- with the handsome prince?
Yes, I love the pumpkin chariot part
And the little mouse?
I don't remember a mouse
Or was it a raccoon?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i think the star wars movies suffered
Why did they suffer
Well they are not as good as they used to be
That might be nostalgia
Nah i am certain it is not
Then what is it
Disney messed them up
I would not blame Disney
Who do you blame then
The director not the owner
XXXXXXXXXXX
Race to Witch Mountain was a great movie.
Who produced it?
I dont remember the specific name of the producer but I know Disney films backed it.
Yeah I do remember that, wasnt the Rock in it?
Yeah its part of a larger film series
So it was a sequel?
Sort of, the larger series is called Escape to Witch Mountain
Did it do good on the reviews?
No half the people who saw it thought it was terrible
So not one of the Rock's finest works
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I would have to say that my favorite Disney movie is The Lion King.
I can admit that The Lion King is one of my favorites as well. What actors did the voices?
James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, and Whoopi Goldberg just to name a few.
I enjoyed the part when Simba connected with Timon and Pumbaa.
It was really sad when Scar killed his brother Mufasa.
Have you seen the The Lion King on Broadway?
No, I haven't had the opportunity to see it. I'm sure it's great.
We should purchase tickets to go see it!
That would be a great idea!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo you see that movie, Snow White?
That really old one?
Yeah!
Dude that's been out for ever!
But have you seen it?
Of course I have!
What about Frozen?
Man that movie sucks
Why's that?
People won't just let it go!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm kinda upset at how underrated Atlantis was.
It SUCH a  good movie!
The animation is so beautiful.
Yes, especially that scene where Kida is floating in the air towards the crystals.
I mean just the scenery in general and the style.
Honestly, like how gorgeous was that island when the lava dome broke away!
I miss Disney's hand-drawing animations, it makes me sad that it's all CGI now.
Atlantis had a bit of CGI but it worked with the style.
They just don't animate movies like that anymore.
I hear you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Belle or Ariel makes a better heroine?
Definitely Belle I think.
Why Belle? She really didn't triumph anything.
Not true. Belle used compassion and morals to overcome her obstacles as where Ariel's answer was to make a deal with the devil so to speak.
I never thought of it that way.
Belle gave up freedom to protect her father, then swayed the staff to adore her while convincing a think headed man he was worth something.
And you don't see the sacrifices Ariel made just as important?
No because Ariel's answer was to try to cheat to get a man to love her while keeping secrets.
So if this a feminist thing?
Not feminist per se but I do see Belle as a stronger female since she didn't try to take the easy road out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You're about 25 years old right?
Yep, 26 actually.
Nice, so you got to grow up in the wonderful world of classic, hand-drawn Disney films.
I did! All the classics. I must have watched The Lion King at least 100 times as a kid.
The Lion King is hands down one of the best Disney films of all time.
Oh for sure. There probably isn't a person my age out there that hasn't seen The Lion King at least once.
Yea you're probably right. Even with how graphic the scenes with Mufasa and Simba's dad were, it was a great movie for kids.
Yea that scene was heartbreaking. It made the film feel real though.
It made it step away from the classic formula of the good guys always winning and everyone having a happy ending.
Which in turn is probably why it became such an intant classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Big Hero 6?
I did! I watched it with my friends.
Did you like it?
I loved it! The scene where Hiro watches his brother test Baymax was a real tear-jerker.
Yeah  cried like a little baby on that scene. There's a rumor going around that they're planning on a prequel.
I don't think that'll work. What do you think?
Well, Disney isn't really known for making good prequels or sequels.
True. The movie was great, better than Frozen even.
That's what I think so too. A prequel or sequel would just ruin it.
Yea, not a big fan of sequels nor prequels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Disney movie ever?
I'd say Mulan, but I like so many others!
I know it is hard to pick!
My newest favorite is Moana
Newest favorite? That's interesting
Yeah, I just like so many. The old ones are great too
Like what old ones?
Cinderella and Snow White
Oh yes those are very classic!
They never get old!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you know there's a new Wreck-it_Ralph movie coming out?
Really? When is it coming out?
It should be coming out November of next year.
Do you know what it's going to be about?
You know how the premise of the last movie was Ralph traveling into other game worlds?
Yeah, is the next movie going to be something like that again?
In a way, only this time it will be Ralph traveling through the Internet.
Woah, I wonder how's that going to turn out?
We'll see when the first trailer come out.
Ugh, it feels so far away!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Mulan?
Yeah
It was cute, and a great theme
I can't believe they wouldn't let the woman fight
It was funny when she was taking a bath ad she had to not let them see she was a woman
It would be hard to conceal that
There are some jobs they don't let women do in the army
I wouldn't think people would fight unless they had to
They might want to stop an enemy
Either way, it was well written
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the movie Mulan.
Me too. Every time it's on tv I have to watch it.
She's such a strong character.
I know. It's so brave how she takes her father's place in the war.
That's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.
I love when she sings the song Reflection.
Me too. The song I'll Make a Man Out of You is great, as well.
I totally agree. I love when she climbs the log with the weights on and gets the arrow down.
That scene proves that girls are more than just a pretty face.
Definitely. She is a great role model.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you hear about the new Incredibles movie coming out?
Yeah I've been waiting for this movie since I was a kid!
I wonder if it will have all the same villains like Syndrome and the Underminer!
I don't know but I just hope they bring Edna back!
No matter what I'm going to be in the theater the day it comes out!
Same here, I've been waiting since 2004!
Pixar has really mastered the whole animated movie scene huh?
Of course! They keep making hit after hit.
There certainly is no slowing them down.
Yeah especially if they keep releasing continuations of old movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Beauty and the Beast.
The Emma Watson movie?
No, the animated version from 1991.
I saw that as a kid.  Who was Belle?
Paige O'Hara.
There were some cool voices I recall.
Angela Lansbury, David Ogden Stiers, and Jerry Orbach.
From Law and Order?  Wow.
I loved the songs.
I loved Be Our Guest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the cool movie Zootopia?
The one about fox and rabbit?
It's about an utopia for animals.
Yeah, sort of a reflection of humans.
What do you think? Did you like it?
Sure, it was very interesting. It reminds me of New York City.
Is that where you're from? New York?
Yeah, just like Zootopia.
I am from San Francisco. That's another Zootopia.
Sure. Do you remember the sloth? I think that's the best part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you want to live in the world of Disney's Pinocchio?
What do you mean, a world in which a boy exists whose nose grows every time he lies?
Yeah, except the lying-nose growth connection would apply to everyone.
Wow, that would certainly be a way to get a good judgment of who you can trust.
Yeah, it's like a credit score for honesty that's all over your face.
Would the growth be proportionate to the lie?
What do you mean by that?
For example, if I tell a huge lie, that someone tried to kill me for example. Would my nose grow bigger than if I told a white lie about someone else's appearance.
Good distinction. Yeah, it would have to be that way for the nose growth to be any use.
Agreed, unless the growth is happening in real time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe how wonderful Moana was!
Me too! My favorite song was "How Far I'll Go", it was absolutely amazing!
I can't wait for the live-action of Mulan!
I can't either. I feel it's such an empowering movie.
Who's your favorite disney character?
I have so many but Rapunzel is definitely one of my favorites.
Which castle would you choose to live in?
It's a toss up between Arendelle castle and the castle from Tangled.
Which villian do you think is the "best"?
Oh, by far I would say it's Maleficent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the animated film Robin Hood?
Of course I have, it´s great!
What is it about?
Instead of people, humans are represented as animals, and there are the poor and the rich, Robin Hood steals from the rich to give to the poor.
Wow! Sounds very elaborate. What kind of animal is Robin Hood?
He is a Fox, which it suits him well.
What Kind of animal is his antagonist?
Prince John is a lion which is referring the lions as being Kings of the Jungle, because his brother is the rightful King, and his minion is a snake.
Very interesting. Did Robin Hood had any special skills?
Of course, he was a master at archery.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast?
No, I didn't. Did you?
Yeah, I saw it with my mom.
Did you like it?
I did! The music was awesome, and Emma Watson did a great job.
She played Belle, right? She's a good actress.
Yeah, she was Belle. The Beast did a good job, too.
Cool! How was it having real actors and not cartoons?
I thought it made the story more realistic, which makes adults and kids like it.
That's fun! I hope they do more live-action Disney movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the movie the Little Mermaid?
Yes one of my all time favorites.
I know the music sparked the Disney Renaissance.
Alan Menken is a genius composer.
These songs are so memorable.
I love Under The Sea and Part of Your World.
Sebastian the crab is hilarious.
I love his Jamaican accent.
Ursula has great songs too.
Her voice is so sultry and deep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what movie I recently watched again?  'Hercules.'
Wow, I haven't seen that one in forever.
Wasn't it such an excellent movie?
I loved it when I was younger.  I always became so emotional during it.
When Hercules finally became a god and defeated Hades, it was such a powerful moment.
I loved the training montage scenes.  Danny DeVito as Phil was hilarious.
He was the faun, right?
Yup.  I also loved the music of the movie.
What was your favorite?
'Go the Distance' was wonderful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movies came out in the 90's?
Beauty and the Beast and Pocahontas
Were they both good?
Yes
When did Beauty and the Beast come out?
1991
Is it the best movie Disney made?
Yes
What is the name of the main character?
Belle
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movie do you like?
I like Tarzan.
That one is boring.
Which is your favorite?
Toy Story is the best.
I like that one too.
I like tom hanks in it.
tom is great for sure in there.
Have you seen Wall-E
Yes I have!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss the old Disney movies.
Old?  Name some examples.
I am talking about movies like Aladdin, Lion King, and Fantasia.
Fantasia is a classic.
It is.  It used to freak me out when I was younger
The villain of the movie scared me too.  Chernabog.
Did you know that Chernabog was actually a character from mythology?
No I didn't.  What country's mythology?
It came from the Slavic nations.  Walt Disney said that Chernabog represented Satan himself.
Well that is unsettling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about Jungle Book?
It was such a brilliant movie, the visuals are insanely good
I can't agree more, the animals in the movie are lifelike, considering they're CG.
yea, Disney might be the only company that can create visuals like that.
yea, what's your most memorable moments from the movie?
It definitely gotta be the snake scene, where the snake try to hypnotize the kid
how about the huge ape scene, the kid climbed a very tall rock to get to talk to the huge ape.
oh right, now that you mentioned, that was a great scene as well
I hope Disney make more excellent 3D iterations of their classic movies
yeah, even adult would be obsessed with those new dazzling visuals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw the new Cars 3 movie this weekend.
Where did you see it?
I saw it at the drive-in.
Did you like it?
Yeah, I thought it was really cute.
Were all the same characters in it?
Pretty much.  John Ratzenberger was, of course.
That's funny.  Was he Mack again?
Yep, of course.
Cool.  Maybe I'll take the kids this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What disney movie is your favorite?
I like toy story.
Which one?
I still like the first one.
Oh, I like all of them.
The last one was so sad!
I agree. People teared up.
I do not blame them.
I wish it could come back.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Of the classic Disney princesses, who is your favorite?
By classic you mean, maybe Belle, Aurora, Cinderella, Mulan etc.
For the most part yes.
Okay, well in that case, I think I always fancied Mulan.
Why her?
Well, I can relate to her because she is Chinese and I was born in China.
Cool, cool.
Also, she is brave and was willing to sacrifice life and limb for her country.
She was pretty honorable and clever.
Especially in the final scenes when she used what she learned in the military training to plant the fireworks in the building and blow the villain away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Disney movies?
I love them.
What is your favorite one?
I like Cinderella the best.  How about you?
My favorite one is tangled.
Oh that is a good movie.  I love her magical hair!
Her hair is amazing!  Too bad her mother is so mean.
Well it's not really her mother.  Can you imagine being locked up in a tower like that?
No, but at least the movie has a happy ending.
Well that's true, but then it is a Disney movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the movie Beauty and the Beast?
Are you talking about the cartoon or the live action movie?
I rather talk about the cartoon.
Oh I love it! The songs are amazing.
What is your favorite scene?
It has to be while everybody sings and dances Be Our Guest.
Other than Belle, who is your favorite character?
Of course it has to be Lumiere, he is hillarious.
What do you think about Gaston dying?
I think they should have just banished him, and maybe they could have made another movie about his revenge or something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How great was Robin Williams in Alladin?
It was the best performance of any character in the Disney universe.
His singing was great and the lyrics he had.
I think he made up some of the words as he went along.
I think he played the role great and was able to go on both ends of the spectrum.
Yeah he would offer Alladin advice and then at the same time tell him why hes wrong.
Yeah and this is what made the movie so great.
Its a shame hes not here to do a 2nd one.
I think they would have done it by now.
You never know with disney sometimes it takes time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best Disney movie you have ever seen?
Flubber, with Robin Williams, hands down.
That's funny. I didn't really think of that as a popular Disney movie.
No? It's one of the best ones ever made because it inspired me to become a scientist!
Really? Flubber made you want to be a scientist?
Yep. Even when I was a kid I tried to replicate making that bouncy green goo.
I'd bet your parents got mad at you for all the messes you made.
Haha, yep. They sure did.
Did you ever succeed in making something that could bounce balls high into the air like in the movie?
Nope. Unfortunately my parents took away my materials!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Moana.
Yes, I loved it. Dwayne Johnson is so cool.
Totally. The soundtrack was so awesome.
It just makes me want to sing!
I thought the pig was so cute!
And the chicken always getting into trouble was hilarious.
It was nice to see a strong female character.
I agree. It's visuals were really nice too.
Yep, it was beautiful.
That was a really good movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Disney's spin on Sleepy Beauty with Maleficent?
I really liked it! I know people will argue that it wasn't pure to their original movie because they turned Maleficent from an evil witch into a heroine, but I really liked the spin on the story.
That's good because I really liked the new story too. I thought Angelina Jolie did a fantastic job as Maleficent and Elle Fanning did a good job as Sleeping Beauty. The story gave as a better look at Maleficent's background.
She always deserved a good background story and this movie really gave us the perspective we needed to see.
The way they made her turn spiteful and hateful I felt was justified since she was in love with the would be King and he literally stabbed her in the back.
Sharlto Copley did a fantastic job playing the King. I liked how they turned him into the villain. Such a surprise.
The action scenes with the dragon were really good towards the end too. I was rooting for Maleficent.
I like how the narration in the end was from Sleepy Beauty.
The ending really touched my heart.
I wish Disney would do more spins on their classic stories. If it's done as well as in Maleficent I will definitely watch those.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My nephew was over and guess what movie we watched?
What?
Disney's Cars.
Cute movie.
Yes it is. Who's your favorite character?
I like Tow Mater.
Me too. Everyone favorites Lightning McQueen.
Yeah, he's good but Tow is cuter.
I agree.
I miss watching those movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
Beauty and the Beast
New or old?
Old
Oh?  What did you like about it?
It's just better than the new one
Yea, but what specifically
I guess nothing specific.  I just enjoyed it more
I see I see
Yea, Its great
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw a top ten lisit of the 10 saddest Disney movies.
Wait, let me guess... the saddest one would be... Bambi.
I thought so too !!! But no, Bambi was number four on the list.
What was the saddest one?
A movie called UP. Lion King was second, and The Fox and The Hound was third.
Lion King was pretty sad when Simba was snuggled up next to his dead dad.
Yeah, I guess it's the child losing a parent that really tugs on the heartstrings. Dumbo was number 7 because of his mother rocking him through the cage with her trunk.
Aw, that was really sad. There's something about cartoon characters with tears that makes me have tears too.
There was one I had forgotten about though that was number 5, and when I saw it thought that should have been up there in the top 3- Old Yeller.
Oh my gosh, that was really heartbreaking. I don't think anybody has ever watched Old Yeller and not shed a few tears.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite disney character of all time?
I think it would be Ariel.
Why?
Because she had courage, she was like an astronaut. She went to another world basically. for love.
I never thought of it like that, but I guess you are right.
I never understood though why she couldn't just right a note.
Maybe she didn't know how to read or write?
But she signed the contract for Ursula.
True I forgot about that.
We may never know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.  Do you want to go see the Race to Witch Mountain with me?
The reboot with Dwayne The Rock Johnson? Yeah I do!
Carla Gugino is in it too.  She plays the astrophysicist.
Back in the day, I tried so hard to do my lipstick like hers in the Bon Jovi Always video. And she really rocked that hat!
Great, we'll go see it in the theater together....do we want to bring our kids?
Is it really responsible to take them to a movie without watching it first?
Probably not.  Even with Disney movies, it's important to know what your kids are watching.
OK. So we will leave the children home, for their own sakes.
Yes.  It has nothing to do with wanting to go see a movie with The Rock without dragging around our children.
We are so selfless.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really want to watch The Beauty and The Beast movie!
Me too! It is a great part of my childhood
I know, right? I mean, Emma Watson is my favorite actress! She is just amazing
Yes, and Belle character suits her perfectly
Maybe we could watch first the animated movie from 1991 and make a comparison of generations
That's a great idea, but I know I am going to love it
That's true, the story and the characters keep you amazed, don't forget the romanticism and the happy ending
Yes, and also the music and everything Belle has to do to find her prince
It is just lovely, we can go next saturday
Awesome! So we can connect ourselves with our inner children
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like monsters inc?
Yes i love the spin on monsters in the closet
Me too, it makes the kids a little less scared.
It was a very well thought out movie
Sullys my favorite character
Mine too, and Boo because shes adorable
She is adorable.
My kids loved the movie
So did mine
Mine made me buy it
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite classic Disney movie?
I like Sleeping Beauty.
I think my favorite is Peter Pan.
Sleeping Beauty has the really sweet romance between Aurora and Prince Philip.
That's true. Peter Pan doesn't really have a romance.
And I love the fairy godmothers. They're so funny, and they get to save the day!
Peter Pan has a lot of funny parts, too.
And both movies have a lot of good action scenes.
But I have to love the movie that was the origin of Tinkerbell.
Okay, you're right, that does make Peter Pan a classic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Cinderella yet?
Are you talking the cartoon?
No, the newer movie that came out a few years back.
Ah, yes, yes I did.  It was quite good!
I thought so too!  Loved the music in it.
The costumes were really well done.  Her dress looked beautiful.
I think her dress was pink, right?
No, at the ball it was blue.
I might be confusing her with sleeping beauty.
Probably so.  She's nothing like Aurora.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hi man
Whatcha up to
Nothing at all
Nothing?
Nope not whatsoever
Aw thats a good thing
Why is it
Because i want you to come over for Disney movie marathon
Oh my i shall
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney franchise.
Pirates of the Carribean for sure.
Much better than the ride!
I loved the ride!
It's funny to base a movie on an amusement park attraction.
Tortuga relly captured it.
Indeed!
You going to see the new one?
Absolutely.
Maybe I'll tag along.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! What's your favorite Disney movie?
That's hard to say, but I love their animated movies with inspirational characters like Merida and Tiana.
Yeah! I love Tiana, she's my favorite Disney leading lady.
I love her dedication to fulfilling her dreams, it really makes me want to pursue mine.
I'd love to open a restaurant someday. Her food looks delicious.
Me too, her beignets always look delicious.
Mmmm, I begin craving them every time I watch that movie.
Oh, and her dad's gumbo, too!
Yum-my! Let's go make some beignets.
Sure, sounds great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of disney's Lady and the Tramp?
I find that one somewhat boring.
Really? I always loved it.
I think the best part was the song of the two ctas.
We are siamese. I love that tune, so funny. they are such menacing evil kitties.
They really caused a lot of trouble for Lady.
I felt so badly for her. I really loved her journey.
I will say I do love the iconic italian spaghetti scene.
I feel like everybody tries to recreate that at some point.
I know I did try once,lol.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Mickey Mouse in any Disney movies?
Oh sure.
Which one is the best?
Fantasia
Is that old?
Very. It came out in the 40's
Is there a lot of talking?
None. It is silent.
I wanna watch it.
It's so good. You will love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does Zootopia 2 release?
I don't know. I'm not sure they're even making another Zootopia.
What? Why wouldn't they?
I don't know, I'm not a movie expert. Maybe they just haven't got around to it yet.
They need to make another one. I thought it was a clever movie.
It was okay. I like Officer Hops.
Did you know there were over 60 different species in Zootopia?
No I didn't. where did you read?
I read it on Disney's website. They have a lot of fun facts like that.
That's interesting, I'll check it out. I wonder what else is on there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I see "Cars 3" is now in theaters.
Yeah, I know.  I don't know if I want to go and see it though?
Why not? Did you see the first two?
Yeah, I did. I liked the first one, but the second one was not as good.
I know what you mean. And Michael Keaton doesn't do the voice of "Thunder" like he did in the first one.
It does look a lot like the first movie though, with all the racing.
I liked the way that the main character, Lightning McQueen, takes on the role as a mentor.
It sort of brings the movie full circle in that regard.
Maybe I'll just wait to see it when it comes out on DVD.
That's what I was thinking, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't you just love the music in all of the Disney movies?
I do. It is very well done.
I usually purchase the soundtrack when it becomes available for the majority of the films.
Wow, really?
Yes.  I just also love that they have well known actors and musicians singing in the films.
I do too.  That's what makes them so addicting I think.
Yes, because you know the voices.  It's not just some unknown.
Although, sometimes they have cast unknowns that have been wonderful.
Yep, and they have been skyrocketed to fame.
Yes, you are very right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard 'Hakuna Matata' the other day and was reminded of how much I loved 'The Lion King.'
One of my favorite Disney movies of all time.
That scene with Mufasa's death was very powerful.
Did you know the movie got four Golden Globe and Oscar nominations?
That doesn't surprise me.  If anything, I would expect more.
Also, thinking about it, the movie was Disney's version of 'Hamlet.'
A great point.  Both are about a prince whose father is killed by the uncle, and then is exiled.
And he comes back later and reclaims his throne.
The fact that a children's movie has parallels to literary classics is very cool to me.
It was incredibly well done and complex.  I wish more children's movies were like 'The Lion King.'
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Moana movie?
Yes and I really liked it, although my nephews thought the lava monster was a little scary.
haha I could see that. I didn't really know much about Hawaiian culture.
Me either, it was interesting to see Maui come to life.
Ya I think Dwane Johnson did great in that role.
Definiatey different from his most recent roles thats for sure!
I know right... I loved him as Maui.. who knew?!!?
And you're right it was really interesting to see the Hawaiian culture and their legends of creationism and gods.
Yeah I had no idea, it made me want to learn more and visit Hawaii of course!
We should totally plan a trip... because "One day I'll know, how far I'll go"...
XXXXXXXXXXX
I rewatched The Little Mermaid over the weekend.
How was it.
Good, actually, I wasn't sure it would hold up over time.
Why is that?
Some movies from oru childhood loose their touch as we get old, this was still really good.
Did you like anything more then when you were a kid.
I found i liked the music more, maybe I understood the lyrics better.
I could see that.  The music for that movie was really good.
It was, and I liked Sabastion even more, he was really funny.
Yeah, when he's trapped in the kitchen with the chef cooking all the seafood, thats a great scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movie, would you love to see a sequel to?
Moana, definitely.
I'm sure with its popularity, it will get one. Disney milks that dollar.
Yes, but they also put out quality sequels.
Not always!
I think with Moana that they will.
Yeah. I loved the the cinematography of Moana. It really was beautiful.
I felt like I was at the ocean. It almost made me nervous.
I know what you mean! When they were on that little boat in the ocean, I felt like I was there too.
I would be so scared if I really was!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that certain Disney movies are available on Hulu now?!?
No way! That's all I used to watch growing up!
Me too. They have Hercules on there which is one of my favorites.
You know Hercules is what got me into greek mythology...
I didn't know that but I totally get it. They had so many different characters in it.
Yeah I was a big fan of Hades too! Haha!
He was so funny and sarcastic!
Yeah and the sidekicks, Pain and Panic, were funny too!
I really liked Meg too. I think I related to her a bit when I was growing up. She came off so cool!
She was super cool! No damsel in distress there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember "Wreck it Ralph"?
Yes, why?
Well they are making a sequel of it.
Oh that's great, I loved the first one.
Me too.  John C. Reilly is hilarious in it.
I know, I can almost see him when he speaks.
And the animation is so great!
And it makes me remember all the video games I played as a kid.
I know, like Pac Man and Frogger.
Such a good movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
Beauty and the Beast.
Oh, I love that one too!
Belle is my favorite princess.
I know, I love to see a female lead that is smart and loves books.
That's my favorite part!
Did you see the live action movie?
Yes, I thought it was great!
I love that Disney is doing more of those types of remakes.
Me too, it brings a whole new side to the classic movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the Lion King is based on Hamlet?
Really? I've never heard that before.
I just found out the other day. It really puts things in perspective.
Yeah. I've never thought of it like that. So Simba would be Hamlet?
Yeah, exactly. And he mopes around and then comes to terms with taking revenge for his father.
On Scar or Claudius.
Right. It's amazing how Shakespeare plays still influence us today.
It is! Are there any other Disney movies like that?
Not that I know of, but I bet one or two have some influences!
I'll have to watch and look!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch The Lion King?
Yes, I remember Rafiki
He was some kind of medicine man
He was brutally honest with Simba
He put pressure on Simba that Nala may not have been able to do
I would have liked to see Simba stay in the jungle. At the point he returns, he was not aware of what was going on
There seemed to be a lack of male lions in that area
I think Rafiki gets credit for reconnecting Simba with his father
Simba's father was a positional leader to some extent
Yeah, he did not have a backup plan in place
XXXXXXXXXXX
The new Beauty and the Beast movie was so good!
It really was. I love Emma Watson as Belle. And they did a good job with the other actors, too.
Did you like the music?
Yes, definitely. They did the classic songs so well but I also loved all the new songs. It added it's own flair to the classic movie.
I think my favorite part was when Beast showed Belle the library. It was such a big library, I wish I had one like that!
I wish I had his castle! And all the people who worked in the castle are so great. I would love to have Lumiere as a friend!
Lumiere is great, but I love Mrs. Potts and Chip the best. Chip is so cute.
He is cute. I'm really glad they did a live-action remake of it. It was better than I expected.
It was really good! I love the classic, but this one has it's own charms.
I agree. It was a great movie and I'm glad kids get to grow up with their own special version of the movie I loved so much as a kid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think The Little Mermaid is good?
It is one of the all time classic Disney movies!
Really? I have to check it out.
You really should. I suggest purchasing the original from 1989.
Wow. Is it that old?
Yes, but it is a timeless classic.
I heard there is a modern version, is this true?
Yes, there is a film coming out in 2017.
Wow, I want to see the original now before watching the 2017 one.
Yes, highly recommended.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the next Disney movie will be?
No idea, they seem to be going more towards animal movies.
Yah your kind of right!
Well maybe they will bring out some more classics?
Which old ones did you enjoy the most?
I loved little mermaid, and Beauty and the beast.
Gastion, is such a joker in that movie.
Right its really crazy how he already has so many ladies after him but really wants bell!
He think she is beautiful!
Thats why they call the movie that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you take the kids to see the new Beauty and the Beast?
Yeah it was really good.
The special effects were out of this world.
Tell me about it.  The candle was awesome.
And just as funny as the cartoon.
I couldn't believe how close that was to the cartoon version.
Yea it couldn't have been closer.
Although the Gastone song was way funnier in the cartoon.
You can't have everything.
But seriously it was good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your all time favorite Disney Movie?
It would have to be Aladdin.
Oh yeah. Robin Williams was awesome in that.
I also liked Emperor's new Groove.
For me it would have to be the Liion King.
How could I forget that one.
Lioin King must be the best Disney film of all time.
Pretty much.
I wonder how many made for home release videos they did off of that one alone.
It has to be at least 10?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Peter Pan.
Me too. Are you watching it?
No but I watched it last night.
I wish I was Wendy Darling. Except I would stay in Neverland.
You should be Tinkerbell!
Yeah that's true.
I hate Captain Hook.
I think everyone does.
And the alligator!
I want to watch it now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if disney will ever acknowledge a LGBT relationship.
I'm willing to bet.
Really?
Oh yes, I think there has been a gay couple shown in a show recently.
I think Star vs. the Forces of Evil.
Yes, and I think there was a petition for Elsa from Frozen to be LGBT.
Wow, that would be awesome.
Definitely.
Or she can remain single, that would be fine too.
That would definitely be fine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really liked the movie Moana.
Oh, I saw it last week and didn't think it was anything special.
It's one of the best movies I've ever seen! What didn't you like about it?
I'm not sure, it just didn't hold my interest.
I loved it because it taught me about a different culture and just felt different from most other movies.
How was it different from other movies?
It didn't have a love story, which was kind of refreshing.
Maybe that's the reason it didn't hold my interest.
I guess you could be right. I loved it though!
I won't be seeing it again anytime soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Swiss Family Robinson.
That's an oldie.  Disney?
Yes, released in 1960.
Who's in it?
Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran from Old Yeller.
Cool.  Anyone else?
James MacArthur.
Cool.  The original Dan-o.
Who directed?
Ken Annakin
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw The Little Mermaid.
The new movie?
No, the animated version from 1989.
I loved that one.  I watched it as a kid.
I loved Part of Your World
I liked Under the Sea.
Who were some of the big name voices?
Pat Carroll, Buddy Hackett and Rene Auberjonois
Who was the voice of Ariel?
Jodi Benson.  What a voice!
XXXXXXXXXXX
i love The Goofy Movie.
it was so funny.
i like the songs.
what was his sons name?
it was Max.
oh yeah.  he was good at skateboarding.
i remember that.
did they go on a trip.
Yes.  It was awesome.
i should see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Disney sidekick?
What do you mean sidekick?
Well Mickey had Donald, Goofy and Minnie. Winnie the Pooh had Tigger, Eeyore, Rabbit and Piglet.
Out of those choices I think Tigger was the worst sidekick but still my favorite.
What do you mean worst?
Tigger never had a clear thought process to work with. He just did what he wanted when he wanted and never thought of the consequences.
You are right, he was always getting the group into trouble.
Yes but never intentionally.
Very true since he was just a happy go lucky kind of a guy.
Which is why I liked him! He just couldn't help himself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana?
Yes, I have. What did you think about it?
It was amazing! I have seen it three times already!
Wow. What was your favorite part?
I like the "Shiny" scene with the Crab.
Oh that part was neat. I feel like it was so true to life.
I'm going to watch it right now!
Did you dislike anything from it?
Hmm, let me think. No.
Wow, I know a lot of people are big warriors for that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched Moana?
Yeah! It was cute, but I thought it was a little inapproapriate.
Oh, really? Why is that?
I think it glamorizes tattoos and exposes children to them at such an early age.
Yeah, I saw most of the male characters had tattoos, but they were tribal and part of their culture.
That's true. It still isn't something I want my kid looking at and wanting to get.
I understand. You can probably just tell your kid that some culture norms are different and even though they have tattoos in theirs, doesn't mean it's acceptable in yours.
Well, I'll just tell my kids to not get any funny ideas and stick to the movie plot. Which was excellent, by the way.
I know, I love how wacky the demigod Maui was!
Oh, I particularly loved that he resembled Dwayne Johnson so much, my favorite actor!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the live action remake of Beauty and the Beast?
No, I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater.
You should definitely rent or buy the DVD. It was amazing!
Did they use any of the original music? I love the music in that movie!
Yes, they did! My favorite remake was the theme song, "Beauty and the Beast."
I'm not sure anyone could do it as well as Angela Lansbury did.
She was amazing in the original, that's for sure. But this version was really good.
What was your favorite thing about the remake?
The costumes were completely amazing! You really have to see it to appreciate it.
I will definitely rent it, maybe even buy it. Thanks for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hear they are making a new Cinderella movie next year.
Really, is Disney doing that? That would be great.
I agree, she is one of my favorite characters.
Mine too, as well as Snow White.
Oh, yeah. I saw that movie at least ten times when I was a kid.
Me too, I could say every phrase before it was spoken.
Indeed, and the songs were always so nice.
Yes, they were. Wauw, a new Cinderella movie would really be fantastic.
Absolutely, I hope we get some more information soon.
Disney always makes great movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Finding Nemo?
Nope. It's one of my least favorite movies Disney has made actually.
Yeah I didn't really like it either.
It seems like almost all the Disney movies are good except for that one.
Why do you think we don't like it so much?
It's probably because there's too much kiddy stuff, I don't know.
Well all disney movies are for kids! Haha.
That's true, but the characters in this movie are annoyingly kiddish.
Yeah, I suppose that's true, but the dentist scene was pretty funny.
I'd have to agrree with you on that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
What was the last disney movie that you saw?
Good question let me think.
sure.
I saw Snow White with my kids recently.
Oh nice.
Yeah they loved it.
Isn't that one of the first disney animated movies?
Yeah I think it is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the live action Little Mermaid movie that's coming out?
Yes! I'm really excited!
Me too. I loved the cartoon version. Ariel is one of my favorites.
Mine too. Do you know who is playing Ariel?
I haven't heard yet. They'll need a good actress.
They'll need good cast for Eric, Ursula and King Triton too.
I wonder if it's all going to be filmed underwater or on a green screen?
I would think a green screen!
Wouldn't that sort of cheapen it?
Nah, with effects these days it will look great. Besides, they have to add in Flounder and Sebastian!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Alice in Wonderland is so weird.
I love that movie. The Mad Hatter is the best.
I like the Mad Hatter, but my favorite characters are the twins.
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum?
Yeah, those two.
Why?
They're hilarious. I love the noise they make when they bump in to each other.
They're interesting. I still like the Mad Hatter the most.
The Mad Hatter is crazy and weird.
That's the whole point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Frozen movie
yes and I loved it
What character was your favorite?
Olaf and yours?
I loved Olaf!
I love that song too!
You mean Let it Go?
Yes.  That was a great song.
I can't wait for a sequel.
I hope it is soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Big Hero 6 was well done.
Yes I enjoyed it. Hero was a great character.
I loved Baymax. I bet he feels like a big blow up balloon.
It sure would be fun bouncing on him, ha ha. But seriously it was a good story.
Yes, it was sad when Hero's brother died. I was not expecting that.
It does seem like many characters get killed in Disney films.
It is meant to show resiliency in characters I guess.
Yes, I don't know how they would have made a good story about that without his brother's death.
Yes sometimes good characters die.
I cried when the original Baymax also "died". Glad he gave Hero his disk so he could rebuild him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
No! I've been wanting to see it!
It was really good!
Yeah, my boyfriend said he would take me but he never did.
Well you should rent it and watch it at home now.
Maybe I will. I hear good things.
Yeah the singing was really good.
I love singing Disney movies.
Me too, the main song was stuck in my head for a week.
Ok, I am going to watch it tonight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you imagine them making a cross over
Huh
Like Disney Pixar making a cross over movie
How
Like include people from various movies
Examples
Like imagine mater Lilo and Hercules
That would be interesting movie
I know right
Yuppers
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite character in Beauty and the Beast?
Mrs. Potts.  Definately.
What do you like so much about her?
When Angela Lansbury sings the theme song, it is so beautiful.
But Angela Lansbury does not really have a great singing voice.
Not really, no.  However she has a certain quality to her singing that's very sweet.
I liked how Mrs. Potts interacted with her son, Chip.
I don't know how, but somehow I found a chipped cup to be cute.
Do you think they will create a Beauty and the Beast sequel?
I kind of hope not.  They got it right the first time around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey User 2, I'm looking for a movie for my kids to watch this weekend. Any suggestions?
Are your kids fans of video games?
Video games? Heck, that's all they do these days.
In that case, I would suggest watching "Wreck-it Ralph".
Oh, is that a movie about video games?
Yes, the main character is an arcade game villain, from a game kind of like Donkey Kong.
Donkey Kong? I don't know if my kids will get the reference.
See, that's the great part. The movie has all sorts of references and cameos from video games from the arcade era all the way up to modern games, even some mobile games' characters make an appearance.
Ok, that sounds good. I think my son will like it, but what about my daughter?
One of the protagonists is a girl named Vanellope von Schweetz, whose backstory models her as an inspiration to girls, especially ones who may have encountered bullying.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, which Disney movie do you like better: Mulan or The Little Mermaid?
Mulan, definitely! The Little Mermaid was kind of lame.
I like The Little Mermaid better, Ariel was very pretty.
Yeah, but she fell in love with Prince Eric as soon as she saw him!
Well, I guess she was a little desperate.
Mulan, on the other hand, saved the entire country of China! And what did Ariel do? Nothing!
Sheesh, okay!
Sorry. I respect your opinions, but Mulan was still better!
Okay, okay!
Sorry. They were both good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will play Mulan in the new live-action Mulan movie?
Gosh, I have no idea. How can that movie possibly live up to the original?
I don't know. I have high hopes, though.
I hope they cast Lucy Liu.
No way, she's too old!
I hope they cast another unknown. That girl was so good in Moana!
Yeah, I agree, although I can't remember her name.
Me neither, I'll look it up later. She's so talented though.
And she's only 14!
Wow, I wish I could sing like that when I was 14. Or now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
which is your favoruute Disney movie?
Tangled, what about it?
It was good but i liked Frozen more.
I didnt like that one much, Tangled had some really funny moments
Yes, Maximus character was quite funny and the Pascal the frog too
yes him too.
I like Frozen for its emotional content and the way sister bond was shown between Anna and Elsa.
Elsa was the younger one right?
yes. Did you like her character?
Yes, yes i did. The older sister's character was poorly written.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
Easy! 'Aladdin'. I love the story, and the music.
Robin Williams is the voice of the genie, isn't he?
Yes! I can't imagine anyone else voicing that character.
Me neither. His voice is so expressive, he did such an amazing job.
And the genie is just a great character. So funny.
You're right, the music in 'Aladdin' is great, too. So catchy.
And all the characters have a song or two each, which is always cool.
What your favorite song from the movie?
'Prince Ali' because Robin Williams does all those hilarious voices in one song. I love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
Beauty and the Beast
New or old?
New, for sure
Yea I heard it's good
You havent seen it?
Nope!
Oh man you GOTTA GO SEE IT!
It's that good, eh?
It's awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Aladdin?
Yes, that was a good movie. I remember watching it as a kid.
Robin Williams as the Genie was great.
Yes, he had a lot of good lines.
Who was the Parrot character?
I think it was Gilbert Godfrey.
Man, he had an annoying voice.
Yes. Good songs with that one as well.
Yes, especially A Whole New World
I get chills every time I hear it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm sure they will do a good job with the new movie.
Ya I hope they have good music in it.
I'm pretty excited to see it.
I've seen every Dinsey movie and Frozen is one of my favorites.
Oh wow I know I have seen a lot of Disney movies but not sure if I have seen every one.
Ya I try to make sure I see every Disney movie at the theater if possible.
wow that is really impressive. Which ones were your favorite?
Hmm... that's tough. Frozen definitely and Toy Story
Oh ya I liked Toy Story a lot too. I haven't seen the third one yet.
You should I bet you would like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Tangled?
Is Tangled the one with Elsa and Anna?
No - Tangled has Rapunzel and Mother Gothel.
I never saw it. Was it good?
We loved it. The music was fun and story was fast-paced.
Who voiced the characters?
I know Mandy Moore voiced Rapunzel.
I haven't seen a movie with Mandy Moore in it for ages.
I know, right? Anyway, you should check it out.
I will see if it's on Netflix.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you say the little mermaid was a comedy?
Not any more than I would say that about Alladin.
Yeah but I think it was just too funny.
There were serious parts of it.
Like when Ursula did all that evil stuff.
Yeah those parts were rough.
I think Sebastian was great.
Oh yeah he was the comedic relief.
But not a feature player.
Yeah so it was like every other Disney film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe how many Disney movies have come out over the years. How many can you name?
Well, let me think. Bambi, Cinderella, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Alice in Wonderland.
You're pretty good! Can you think of any others off the top of your head?
What about the one with the bears? I can remember them singing about bear necessities, but I can't recall the name of the movie.
Oh, yeah! Now I can't remember it either!
That's funny. I know Disney made Lady and the Tramp, and Brother Bear, but I don't think it's in either of those two movies.
No, definitely not. Maybe it was the Jungle Book?
Yes! I believe that's the one.
I'm going to have to dig out my old VHS movies now and watch some of these great Disney movies! Thanks for the reminder!
Well, I'll have to bring the family over to watch them with you then. Sounds like fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss watching Lilo and Stitch, we should see it again some time.
Yes! I loved the music in it.
My favorite song was the one in the beginning when Lilo so was swimming and giving Pudge the fish a sandwhich.
I loved the amount of Elvis in there.
Can we talk about Nani though? She's such a lovely character.
I know right? She looks like an actual human being compared to the rest of Disney's animated women.
Not to mention that it's emphasized that her and Lilo's relationship isn't perfect.
Yeah, I can't imagine having to raise my own sibling at that age for either of them.
I can't imagine having to live with Stitch, Pleakly, and Jumba.
Haha, that's true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
you want to hear something i noticed
What did you notice
Well you know how for the longest time that they had not made any sequels for movies
Yeah?
well back then more original movies came out
Mmmhmm
Now they stopped that and are just abusing sequels
But is that not a bad thing
Yes and no
How so
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
Seen any disney movies recently?
Yeah I have.
What did you end up seeing?
I saw Fantasia.
Was that on tv?
No, I had the dvd.
Oh cool.
One of my favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Ice Princess from Disney?
Is that a cartoon or real life?
It's a real life movie.
Yes, about the ice skater right?
Yes. I thought that  movie was well done, I liked it.
It was pretty good.
The girl who played the lead role was pretty. You never heard much about her.
Wasn't Joan Cusack in that too?
Yes. She's a pretty good actress too.
I don't remember the movie much. I'll have to rewatch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know if there are any more Tinkerbell movies coming out?
Not sure. I haven't heard of any new ones coming out.
Yeah the last one was called Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast.
That one was pretty good.
I liked it a lot. my favorite though was the Pirate Fairy one.
I loved how they showed a young captain hook in that one.
It was cool. I almost thought he was a good guy until it surprises you.
Yeah it was a cool twist that he was bad all along.
I really do hope they make a new one. I love those movies.
Me too. I always watch them when they come out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know they're making a toy story 4?
I didn't, I loved the first 3.
Me too, the new one comes out in 2019.
It'll definitely be worth the wait for that.
I think so too, I'm going to buy a Woody or Buzz Light Year doll for my cousin's birthday.
I used to have a Woody toy of those as a kid.
Did you like it?
I used to play with it all the time but I kind of wish it had been a Buzz Light Year toy.
I'll end up buying him a Buzz toy instead then.
I'm sure he'll like it as much as I would have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which new Disney movie are you most excited for?
Definitely, the Incredibles 2.
Have you seen Finding Dory?
No, not yet.
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Monster's Inc.
Who's your favorite Disney princess?
Mulan.
Have you seen the sequel to Mulan?
Of course.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think my all time favorite Disney movie is Alice in Wonderland.
Oh good one! Do you like the animated one or the live version better?
I'd have to say the animated version.
Really? Why?
I thought Johnny Depp was really creepy as the Mad Hatter.
I thought he was awesome!
I also just really don't like Tim Burton's style, like I don't like how his movies are directed.
I get that, it's definitely a really creepy vibe.
Yeah, I like the colorful, playful animation of the original.
I think that the Tim Burton version fits the book better!
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's hard to beleive that Star Wars is a Disney franchise now.
Huh?
Yeah, Lucas sold out.
Figures.
At least they're doing a good job with it.
Yeah, the prequels were pretty underwhelming.
About time George hung up his hat.
When does the next installment come out?
I think in November.
I'm super excited!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are we still watching Disney movies tonight when everyone comes over?
Absolutely! I've got several of them picked out, so we've got plenty to choose from.
Cool, what have you gotten for tonight?
I've got The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Mulan, Frozen, The Princess and the Frog, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White.
Wow, that's quite the list.
Yep! I know everyone won't be here long enough to watch more than two or three, so I wanted a big enough list to choose from.
Well, you've definitely succeeded on that.
I hope so. I've also got some Disney themed snacks. Gummy frogs, apple bites, "glass" candy, gummy fish, little swords for the sandwiches, and some ice cream, too.
Well it all sounds amazing to me!
Thanks! I really hope the Disney night is a success.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are the Pixar movies part of Disney?
I think so.  My favorite is "A Bug's Life".
That one is hysterical.  I love Flik.
There's so many jokes that you have to watch it more than once to appreciate it.
I know.  And the fake outtakes at the end are the best!
There's so many famous people doing the voices, too.
I know.  Kevin Spacey is Hopper for example.
And John Ratzenberger is in it of course.
What part does he play?
P.T. Flea who drives that circus wagon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about classic Disney films like Cinderella?
I like the cartoon style of animation from those old movies.
I agree. There was something magical about them, everything from Neverland in Peter Pan to the castle in the animated Beauty and the Beast.
I can't quite put my finger on it, but they were more colorful than the recent flicks.
Yes, and the two dimensional style made them feel less real.
You're on the right track.
I don't know. The modern ones with three dimensional animation lack a fantasy element, even though I loved Finding Nemo.
Yes, Willem Dafoe was awesome as Gill; but the setting was too modern.
Yes, present-day settings and realistic effects hinder escapism.
And that's what Disney once stood for: transcendent movies that brought out the child in all of us.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, can we listen to the Frozen soundtrack?
Sure, that sounds fine to me. I dig on that soundtrack for sure.
It's a really good one. I must have heard it a hundred times and I still like it every time.
Yeah, the singing is great. Hey, remember that thing-- the lovely and talented Adele Dazeem!
What? Is she one of the singers?
Well, I mean, no, the singer's name is Idina Menzel. But there was some awards show where John Travolta was introducing her and said her name wrong.
I mean, I'm... I'm not a Broadway person, so I don't know anything about that.
That's okay. It was a thing for like two weeks, like four years ago. I'm not surprised you don't remember it.
Okay. Well, whatever. Let's listen to the Frozen soundtrack!
Yes!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The new Beauty and the Beast movie did well in the box office.
Yeah, it was good!
They had new songs that weren't in the animated version though.  Why was that?
I think the Broadway vesion had those new songs.
Oh really?
I'm not sure.  That's what I heard.
I didn't mind the new songs.  I just wasn't expecting them.
Did you like Emma Watson as Belle?
Yeah, she is a good actress and seemed to portray Belle the way she was meant to be portrayed.
Yeah, she was independent and strong-willed but also kind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Big Hero 6 Yet?
Not sure, which one is that about?
It's about a boy who's brother's science project helps him and his friends bring his brother's killer to justice.
Sounds pretty intense.
It is a really good movie.
I will have to check it out.
I like it a lot. There are some funny characters like Fred who is voiced by TJ Miller.
That guy is pretty funny in a lot of his movies.
I think the best part of the movie is the character Baymax.
I will have to watch that movie to see for myself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I used to collect Disney movies. I wish I had kept ahold of them.
Oh really? What was your favorite.
I think Beauty and the Beast will always be my favorite.
Have you seen the new one yet.
Yes and it's ok, I just preferred the animated version. I'm old school I guess.
Yeah, we grew up in the era of Disney movies like Aladdin.
That was one of my favorites too! Robin Williams was awesome in that one.
I used to love one about a girl who got kidnapped and some mice who saved her....I can't remember the name.
Oh! The Rescuers!
Yes! That's it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana?
Oh I did, it was great! The way the ocean was its own character was fascinating.
I know and the songs are so addictive. I've been singing "You're Welcome" since I saw it.
I know me too! It's almost as bad as Let it Go.
Almost. I had that song stuck in my head for weeks.
Did you know it was The Rock Dwayne Johnson doing the voice of Maui?
I didn't know that until after I saw it. He has a pretty decent singing voice.
Yeah who would have thought it? I loved him in CIA Central Intelligence.
He was actually pretty funny in that, him and Kevin Hart.
The Rock plays equally well doing cute and playful characters as he does playing tough guys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you heard about the new Mulan live action adaptation?
Yes, I have. I'm really excited about.
Me too. Mulan is one of my favorite movies.
Mine too. I really like it because it has one of the best movie sequels ever made.
Yes, I agree. The music in both movies are amazing.
Yes, I agree. The feminism displayed by Mulan in both movies is also really aspiring.
I know, its the first thing that drew me to those movies.
Yes, it parallels that of Frozen. I live it.
You're right! Ming-Na Wen and Idina Menzel were perfect for their respective roles.
Don't forget Kristin Bell. She was good too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm trying to find The Lion King on DVD.
Why?
For our Disney collection.
Great movie. Love the music too.
Me too. I can't find it.
Even though he loses his Dad, that is such a happy movie.
Yes, there's a lot of bad going on, but it is cute.
I like Timone and Pumba.
Me too.
The second one wasn't bad either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Findiny Dory?
No not yet, I heard it's really good though.
Yea I thought so. Probably not as good as Finding Nemo, but still good.
Well Finding Nemo was an instant classic, so it would be pretty hard to top the original.
That's true.
Is there going to be another sequel after Finding Dory?
I can't tell you, that's spoil the end of Finding Dory for you if you ever decided to see it.
Ok, ok, fair enough.
Definitely give it a watch though. You can never go wrong with Ellen Degeneres voicing a fish.
Haha, yea I'll make sure I watch it soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Aladdin?
Yes, that's probably my favorite Disney movie of all time.
I love the songs in that one.
Me too, which one is your favorite?
I love "A Whole New World."
Yeah, that's my favorite too. Which character do you like the most? I like Abu.
I like the Genie the best. I miss Robin Williams.
Yeah, he was outstanding in that role. It's a shame he didn't appear in the sequels.
Yeah, the sequels to Aladdin were okay, but nothing was quite like the original.
Agreed. Aladdin is definitely the best of the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like old Disney movies better than the new ones?
I like the new ones because of the graphics.
I like the old version because I don't like the live action remakes.
I didn't like Beauty and the Beast that much either.
I love Pixar movies.
Toy Story is my favorite what's yours?
Finding Nemo.
I liked Finding Dory better.
It made me cry.
All Disney movies make me cry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know I think that makes sense as a reason for Rapunzel's hair being gold...
So that there would be a color scheme?
Yea, I think disney does that a lot.
I think so too.
Like in "Brave," it is turquoise and orange with maybe some greens.
In "The Princess and the Frog," the color scheme is greens, blues golds and maybe purples and browns for Facillier.
With villains, I think you know something truely evil is happening based on how much green is in the frame.
I've read an article about that.
Apparently, the most evil scenes in Disney movies are the greenest.
Like "Be Prepared" in "The Lion King."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Disney's version of Pinocchio?
The old cartoon?
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, my mom had rented it for us on VHS when I was a kid.
And you still remember it?
I remember parts of it.
What do you remember from it?
I think what stuck with me were the things that became controversial?
Oh, like don't the kids smoke and drink beer?
Yeah, something like that.  Even as a kid, it seemed wrong to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's your favorite Disney movie?
I don't know, that's a really tough question, there are so many good Disney movies.
Yeah, that's true. For me though, it's easy. My favorite is the Lion King.
Why is it your favorite?
It was a huge part of my childhood. I loved the music and the animation.
Yeah, I see that. I feel the same way about Aladdin.
Oh yeah? My sister loved Aladdin. There was a period of time where she'd watch it every day after school.
Yeah, I did the same. It transported me to a magical place. What do you make of Aladdin?
I like it enough, but it doesn't compare to the Lion King for me.
Yeah, I get that. Everyone has a different Disney movie that they love.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Toy Story considered a Disney movie?
Kind of. Disney bought Pixar. So, they do own the characters.
Toy Story is my favorite Disney movie. Lion King is my favorite too.
You can't have two favorites of any same medium. You have to pick one.
Okay. Frozen is my favorite Disney movie.
Frozen? You didn't mention that one before.
Sheesh! I have too many favorite Disney movies to count.
All Disney movies can't be your favorites! Only one can be your favorite.
Well Tom Hanks is Woody and Tim Allen is Buzz. Can't they just both be my favorites?
NO!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Lion King?
Yes, It was a big part of my childhood. I loved Simba.
Simba was my favorite too! Were you scared of Scar?
Yes, Scar was the Worst. Have you seen the Little Mermaid?
Yes, I idolized Ariel growing up. What about you?
I wanted to be Ariel and marry Prince Eric. What is your favorite Disney character?
I love Rapunzel. What about you?
What did you love about Rapunzel? My favorite is Mickey.
Mickey is a classic. I wanted Rapunzel's hair.
Rapunzel does have some great hair.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some fairy tales that Disney missed?
Little red riding hood, Jack and the Beanstalk-
Wait, they are actually animating that one.
Really, now?
Yes, it's going to be called Gigantic.
When is it coming out?
2018, I believe.
Wow, can't wait. 2D or 3D?
3D animation I think, don't know much about the plot though.
I guess we will have to wait to find out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The original Beauty and the Beast was pretty overrated.
Oh, now I know you're trying to pick a fight.
I'm ready for it.  1991 was just a weak year for movies.
That movie was a classic tale with great songs and great animation.
Was it really though?  There are tons of better Disney movies.
How can you not love Belle?
Belle is bratty and selfish.
You are completely crazy.  She's brave and strong and independent.
To you maybe.  To me, she'll always be a dumb girl who shouldn't run off to the woods.
I'm not sure we can be friends anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Finding Dory?
Yes, we went opening weekend, it was SO cute!
What did you think of the storyline?
I loved it. Dory is every parent's worst nightmare.
She is. She is so cute and means no harm.
Some of the coping skills her parents use are amazing.
I would never have thought of creating a song about the undertow.
Me neither. I like the shell path they created, so she would find her way home.
She loves shells.
I loved how they stayed right there, instead of giving up hope.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I better hurry and buy my kids tickets to see Cars 3 this weekend. They are so excited.
Oh, I forgot that was coming out. I need to get tickets for my daughter too.
Is she a big fan of the movies?
She loves them! Mater is her favorite character.
I like him too, but Lightning McQueen is my favorite. How about you?
I adore Sally, but that is probably because I love Bonnie Hunt so much. She is always so good in her roles.
She really is. Did you know she is going to be in Toy Story 4?
I had heard that, but wasn't positive it was true. That's exciting.
I know! All of these great Disney movies coming out around the same time. I better start planning our trips to the movie theater.
Tell me about it. The kids are going to get spoiled going to the movies all of the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did they not say that they were coming out with a part two to "The Incredibles" movie?
Yes it's due to come out in 2018 and I can't wait. It was and still is my absolute favorite movie.
Yes indeed I concur. I don't know what took them so long to come out with a second part. I even thought at one point that they were going to make a series out of it.
Me too!!! Oh my God, what do you think about Edna. She is a hoot. Do you know who Edna reminds me of. She totally looks like the actress Linda Hunt.
(Laughs) You know what coming to think of it she does. Frozone was the man! Samuel L. Jackson did a splendid job. Frozone totally had his persona.
Dash was my dude. So cute. I liked his character, curious, persistent, optimistic and courageous.
Who played Dash, I cannot seem to remember.
Spencer Fox did, and he did a phenomenal job. Kudos to him.
You know what I enjoyed the most? Whilst being entertaining it had a very strong message of being resilient and not trying to hide who you truly are and who you were born to be. Society can put many restrictions on you to prevent you from truly being who you are, but one must strive to be who they were meant to be regardless of the consequences because it is something beautiful. There will be resistance but one must persevere and emerge.
Hmmmm that is a good thought. I saw that in their daughter too Violet. She went from hiding her face until she truly discovered and embraced who she was, then she moved the hair from hiding her face, so I guess according to your lingo she "emerged." Good movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
It is so strange
What
That Disney makes these movies
What movies
With talking vehicles
Whats strange about that
It is like they are trying to steal Thomas limelight
Thomas who
Thomas the tank engine
I cannot believe you said that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like old or new Disney movies better?
I would have to say old, because I grew up on them.
Me too, and I haven't seen many of the new ones.
I really liked 'The Emperor's New Clothes' - that was my favorite of the newer Disney movies.
Incredible to think 'The Lion King' is almost 25 years old, and that's not one of the oldest.
Right - there's some from the 1940s that I still play for my kids.
That's the definition of timeless, really.
Even the humor stands the test of time. My kids love old Disney just as much as new Disney.
And the animation has improved but kept the same style, which I just love.
Exactly - there's a typical, iconic 'Disney style'.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seem the new  Wonder woman movie?
No but I hear it is real good.
i hear it has a lot of action in it.
Yes and the main character is really very good.
Can you tell me the name of the new actress ?
She does look like the previous wonder woman.
think her name is  Gal Gadot
who was the prievious wonder woman?
I beleive her name was Lydia carter..
They seem to remsemble each other
XXXXXXXXXXX
Blank check is a really fun movie, did you see it?
Is it from around 20 years ago?
Yes it is.
Ok yes I think it did.
You should watch it again.
Why is that?
Its a really great movie, funny, smart, and it is a Disney movie.
Ok that sounds great.
Yes it is a great movie.
Thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie The Princess Frog?
Yes, I did, I like the part when the frog turns into a prince
Did you like the way that the princess looked?
Yes, I liked her dress, she is one of my favorite princesses.
the music in this movie was really good, I liked it when the swamp animals were dancing
I also liked that part, the music was different as was the time period.
I loved that she opened her own restaurant, did you like that part?
Yes, I did ! I wish that it was a real place so I could go and eat there!
Maybe Disney will make a place that serves food from Louisiana
Ohhh! That would be so much fun! I would love to go and eat there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you gotten to see Finding Dory yet?
No, but my kids have been asking me to see it.
It was a good movie your kids will like it, my kids especially liked hank the octopus.
They added a lot of new characters to this movie.
Yes, but they kept the some old ones too like Dory, Nemo, and that turtle Crush.
Oh, yeah! My kids love Crush they thought his surfer talk was funny.
It is available to rent at the local rental place in town, we just got it there.
Ok, thanks I will have to check it out.
Enjoy the movie let me know how the kids like it.
I will, thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pixar movies are my favorite.
Me too! Did you know that Pixar is a subsidiary of Disney?
Yeah, I think I heard that before. What does that mean?
It means they're under the umbrella of Disney. All of their movies come out under the Disney imprint.
Are you saying that some Disney movies are Pixar, but that every Pixar movie is Disney?
Exactly.
That makes sense.  I think Finding Dory is my favorite.
Oh, that's a great one. I actually prefer Finding Nemo.
I have to say, it's honestly a tough choice between the two. I might have a recency bias.
Yeah, it's a tough choice. Maybe I have a nostalgia bias.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what did you think about the New Beauty and the Beast that they launched this year?
Hmmmm, there was not a big difference for me. I was actually a bit disappointed.
Why is that?
Well they did not do much to change the story it was pretty much the same. Belle, Gaston, the Beast. There really was not much of a different story line and I found that it was not necessary.
You know what, I feel the same way. I actually still prefer the original Beauty and the Beast to this one. My favorite character was Chip the little tea cup.
Yes he is cute. I think the music from the original Beauty and the Beast was more sophisticated. I was actually disappointed that they redid the original Beauty and the Beast song that was done by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson
Yeah total bummer, that was a big disappointment for me too.
Well at least they kept to the story line.
They did but I think that that is what killed it for me. They should have done a Part 2 and made something totally new instead of trying to do this over.
You're right they really should have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Beauty and the Beast for the first time last night.
That movie is a classic! What did you think?
Belle is great, but I think she is too good to be with the Beast.
I think that's the point of the movie though - the beast isn't really that bad when you get to know him.
I guess so. I really like the fact that Belle loves to read.
I love when the Beast shows her the library and she gets so excited.
Yes! I wish I could have a library like Belle.
Did you like the soundtrack?
I loved the soundtrack. I can't stop singing "This Provencial Life"
My favorite song is Be Our Guest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Little Mermaid was not a very good movie.
Why do you say that? I loved that one.
Yeah it was okay I guess, but I just didn't like the villain.
You mean that giant octopus lady? Why didn't you like her?
She wasn't scary enough to be a villian for me.
Are you kidding? She was horrifying!
Well I don't think anyone was so terrifying as the villian from The Lion King, Scar.
Oh yeah you're right. Scar was a really bad dude.
Yeah Scar actually got Simba's dad killed.
Maybe I'm starting to agree with you on this whole octopus lady thing. Haha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what did you think of finding dory
it was better than NEMO
really?? how so?
it was just more emotional with dory's backstory
nemos story had the death though
it didn't get me as much
there was a longer story with dory I think
you got to know the parents more
there was more of a loss
yeah exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your top disney films?
I think there anImated Peter Pan was really great!
For me the later Hook film surpassed this film.
Not really comparable. One was Animated and the original story more or less. Hook was totally original plot.
I still think it was better than the animated film version.
Was it even a disney film though?
Spielberg began developing the film in 1980s with Walt Disney Productions. But stopped work then later brought it out on his own I think.
So to my point not really the same world. I want to know your disney pic?
I always thought The Lion King was a disney masterpiece. Original story for them too.
It was great. You seem to appreciate an original story more than a rendition of an existing fairytale.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
I like Aladdin
Oh? Whys that?
Jafar is the man!
Oh, rooting for the evil guy, huh?
Yea, I kinda feel bad for him
Why?  He's Evil!
I think he's just misunderstood
I've never heard that one before..
You learn something new every day!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear they are making a new Incredibles movie?
Yes, I did.  I think the movies where Disney works with Pixar are the best.
I think so too.  Finding Dory was great.
I hope they continue making really good sequels for Disney movies. Sometimes kids movies have terrible sequels.
I thought they did well with Monsters University.
I liked that one too.  Cars 2 was terrible.
They're making a new Cars movie too.
Really?  I hope its better than the last one.
The previews for it look pretty good but I think they've kind of beaten that one to death.
I'll just wait until that one comes to dvd to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what did you think of inside out
it was a brilliant movie
Pixar can do no wrong
they just do things so cleverly
they think outside the box
who else would make a movie like that?
a lot of companies but they stand a lone in how they do it.
they make the characters so well too
they end up so likable
they are the best at what they do
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what movie I haven't seen in ages.
What?
Pocahontas.
I don't think I've ever seen Pocahontas. What's it about?
It's about this British soldier who comes to America in the 1800s and meets a tribe of Native Americans.
Cool.
He then falls in love with a local girl named Pocahontas.
As you do.
Then they dance around a giant tree whilst the tribe sings songs.
So basically it's Avatar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see that movie Ratatouille?
I saw that in the theatres, actually. It's been a while.
Here's a question for you, then. Who was Ratatouille?
Trick question! Ratatouille referred to the prepared dish and bistro in the movie.
Exactly. It was not the name of the rat, as a lot of people seem to think.
Yep. The rat's name was Remy.
Something funny about that movie is the fact that we're all supposed to overlook the fact that someone has a rat hanging out on top of their head. Gross!
That's right. I remember the rat would control the cooking while hiding under the chef's hat.
Patton Oswalt did the voice of Remy, by the way.
Cool. I wonder if there were any other famous actors in that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Marry Poppins.
Cool.  Julie Andrews?
Yes, with Dick Van Dyke and Glynis Johns.
I loved the song  "Chim Chim Cher-ee".
I liked "A Spoonful of Sugar" and "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".
I wasn't keen on Dick Van Dyke's attempt at an English accent.
Neither was I.  He could sing and dance well, though.
What happens in the end?
Mary Poppins goes back up into the sky.
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
To this day, Fantasia remains one of my favorite Disney movies.
The music in the film is simply fantastic.
What is your favorite song?
It is hard to pick. My favorite song would have to be The Sorcerer's Apprentice Waltz.
I think I remember that song. Was it the scene where Mickey Mouse puts the sorcerer's hat on and tries to clean?
Yes. He gets the broom to carry the buckets to the water.
I do remember that one. My favorite song is Night on Bald Mountain.
I do not remember that song.
The scene is dark and scary, but the music has hints of Russian inspiration.
Cool. I will have to rewatch the movie and listen for the song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you go see the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast that came out in March?
Yes, I love Emma Watson. She is a really great actress, so when I heard she was playing Belle, I had to go see it.
That movie broke all kinds of money records. It had a 160 million budget, and it's expected to make one billion dollars.
Wow, I guess there were a lot of fans like me who had to go see it.
It ranked among the top ten movie openings ever.
I didn't know it was that popular!
It had the biggest opening for a P-G rated movie, and the biggest opening ever in March, which is pretty incredible considering how diverse kid fans are.
I'm sure Emma Watson probably appealed to both girls and boys since she was in the Harry Potter movies.
She was a great pick by the Disney team. I liked her in the film Noah.
I read an article where Emma said playing Belle was a joyous experience.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on The Hunchback of Notre Dame?
I enjoyed the film. I thought it was very dark for children.
It is a dark story. I was surprised to learn of the actors involved.
I never looked into it deeply. Who was it?
Well hugo was voiced by jason alexander.
George from Seinfeld?
The very same. I like him a lot, I was just shocked to know it was him.
He has a distinct voice. I never watched it more than once to realize who it was. who else?
Well Demi moore is also involved. She was Esmerelda.
They are both very seductive characters/people. I think that was a good casting choice. Demi has a sultry voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the Lion King?
yes, very much so
Came out in 1994
Wow, that long ago. I still remember going to the theater to see it.
Yes, it was a long time ago. I still like it.
I haven't seen it in a while.
Some good songs and good characters.
Who was your favorite
I liked the warthog
Yeah, he was pretty funny
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of the princess in that one Disney movie?
Uh, need a bit more help than that.
Sorry, the princess in Sleeping Beauty.
Oh, her name is Aurora.
Ah, gotcha.  Wasn't her dress blue?
It was actually blue and pink.
I only remember blue.
It actually switched.  If you recall, the fairies kept changing it.
Right.  That's how they eventually were found.
Correct.  It was kind of their fault actually!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the movie based on cars
I think the movie itself is cars
I was not sure
Yeah it is
I also like larry the cable guy
Didnt he play in the movie
Yeah he did
What part
He was the tow truck
Oh that is interesting
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the movie, the Mighty Ducks?
Is that the hockey movie?
Yes it is.
I do remember watching it as a kid.
Did you like it?
Yes I loved it.
I saw it again recently, it is worth a rewatch.
I think you are right, I had forgot about that movie.
It is really funny and exciting.
Yes I remember, thank you for reminding me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear they are making a new Toy Story movie?
Really? Another one?
Yes. I can't say I'm surprised.
I know it is really popular and all, but what else can they do with the storyline?
They have all been really cute. They will think of something.
I never watched the second or third ones. I did see the Halloween short, though.
Well the midway toy story mania is super popular in disney world.
Yes it is. We're lucky to get on it more than once per trip.
They are also making Toy Story land in Walt Disney world too. It's gonna be awesome.
I suppose it makes even more sense to make more movies. Gotta keep that brand alive!
XXXXXXXXXXX
what disney movie do you think has the best bad guy?
oh that is a tough one, but im going to go with aladdin
oh Jafar from aladdin was bad to the bone
yeah he was, and he was super powerful once he got genie under his control
that is true, but there is a lesson to be learned from that
and what would that be exactly?
too much power is not a good thing, because that was what led to his downfall
yeah you are right, he became stronger than genie and it came back to hurt him
exactly now if only i could find a magical lamp
well if you do let me get at least one wish!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Princess and the Frog is an important movie.
Why do you think that?
Because it starred the first Black princess.
I love Tiana--such an ambitious character.
She's good role model for young girls, especially for young Black girls.
And boys! It's good for them to see positive representations of Black women.
Everyone likes to see themselves on screen some time, and Tiana is a great character for children to see themseleves in.
Honestly, she's a great role model for adults as well!
Good point! Maybe if I try to be like Tiana, I won't be such a disaster in the kitchen.
Maybe I'll learn to play jazz!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Disney remaking Beauty and the Beast.
Well, it's a tough question. The original came out in 1991, which doesn't seem like too long ago, but movie making has changed.
That's for sure. I just think the original is so perfect.
It might be, but we're watching with the eyes of adults, not the eyes of a young kid who has grown up on the current crop of movies.
I'm definitely going to see it. I want to find out if the kids of today will get as magical of an experience as we did.
Let's make a plan. I'll come with you.
You're more than welcome to come, but you know there's no shame in seeing a Disney movie on your own as an adult.
I would feel a little weird going in theaters all alone.
Well, luckily you don't have to, but it wouldn't be so bad.
Yeah, I think most people are so taken in by the movie itself that they're not even paying attention to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite kids movie?
I love so many I am not sure I could choose one, how about you?
I love Disney movies, bambi is my favorite
Why does disney always kill off the parents?
I think its so we become really involved with the character, is there one where the parents arent dead?
let me think, Mulans parents live, and lady and the tramp
Oh lady and the tramp, another personal favorite
The classics are always the best
Disney is amazing at keeping relevent
Yes, I heard they bought star warz
XXXXXXXXXXX
what's your favorite disney movie?
I don't know all my options...like all of them?Tangled! Oh I love that movie.
What's so good about that it?
The voices sound real...and the story of Rapunzel was kinda my favorite.
Anything else you liked about the movie?
The twist they added to it , about the magical hair was great too.
I really liked the horse, he was so funny!
The chameleon was hilarious too!
You know Flynn and Rapunzel make an appearance at end of Frozen?
What? No! I missed that detail.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think my favorite thing about Beauty and the Beast is the setting and atmosphere.
I could never figure out what time period it is supposed to be in.
French Roccocco I think...
I can see that.
I'm just judging by the way the castle looked in the end of the movie, the sculptures were Roccocco.
Oh and that happened in France?
Yea, which explains the opening, why everyone was telling Belle, "Bonjour!"
Now that beginning makes sense!
You see, knowing these things makes the movie infinitely better.
Definitely, does.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the scariest Disney moment?
When Simba's dad died was more sad than scary.
Yeah, that's a memorable moment though.
I'm tempted to mention The Jungle Book. I was so terrified of that tiger.
Oh, yeah! Shere Khan.
He was even scarier in the "live-action" remake.
Oh, I think the torch mob in Beauty and the Beast is scary too.
And the mob in the Hunchback of Notre Dame is terrifying.
Wow, Disney loves a mob carrying torches.
Wow, true. I've never noticed that before.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We should watch "The Lone Ranger" later.
I know I still haven't seen it.
It's been out since 2013.
Yes, I remember the trailer for it.  It looked pretty good.
I saw a bit of it playing in a department store.  The train chase scene was pretty crazy.
And Johnny Depp looks pretty cool in it.
Ya he is such a good actor.
And who plays the actual Lone Ranger?
Some guy named Armie Hammer.
I have never heard of him.  His name sounds like Arm and Hammer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen some of the older Disney movies?
I have seen some.  Which ones are your favorites?
I love Bambi and The Little Mermaid.  They are classics.
I have seen The Little Mermaid but I have never taken the time to watch Bambi.
It was one of the first Disney movies that I ever saw so it holds a special place in my heart.
Doesn't Bambi's mother get killed in the movie?
She does but they move the storyline along quickly enough for it to be a kids movie.  Besides, someone always seems to be killed in a Disney movie.
That is true which confuses me sometimes because they are all really kids movies.
I think that kids don't really pay attention to that and it probably bothers adults more.
That is true.  In Beauty and the Beast, my kids just love the music and Belle and don't really care that Gaston dies in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite non cartoon Disney movie?
You mean a non-animated movie?
Yes.
I'd have to say Airbud.
I forgot about that movie.
I loved that dog.
It was a cute dog. Amazing how they trained it.
Yes,  Did you see the football one?
No, what was that called?
Airbud Golden Receiver.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think Disney's biggest movie of the 90s was?
I don't know.  Probably either Aladdin or Pocahontas.
Yeah, I'm sure it'd be either one of those two.
Did you know that Aladdin had a sequel or two?
Was it good?
I never saw it.  It was straight to video.
How did you know about it?
My little sister had it.
I wonder if they used the same voices.
I don't know.  That's a good question.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie as an adult?
Whoo, interesting question, let me think, does Pixar movie count as Disney as well?
yea, Pixar belonged to Disney anyway
then It's definitely gonna be UP, you remember UP
yeah, a kid and an old man going on a special trip with a flying house
I can't believe I still remember it so vividly after so many years
me too. It's so heartwarming to see a couple getting old and love each other
yeah, I almost cried, it's the little sadness that reminds us the beatifulness in many things
that's a very reflective thought
I can't deny
XXXXXXXXXXX
My mom just bought me the Little Mermaid on DVD.
Did they release it finally on DVD?
Yes, last week.
Oh my, I will have to go buy it for my kids and I soon.
You should, it is a classic.
I agree.  How much was it?
I think she paid $14.99 for it.
Wow that is cheap for a disney movie.
Yes, it is a limited release dvd so you better hurry.
I will grab my copy this weekend!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did I ever tell you about seeing Dumbo as a kid.
No, what happened.
Well, we went to the drive inn.  I was 9 and my brother was 7.
Sounds like fun, love Drive Ins
So me and my brother were on top of the station wagon and I noticed he was gone.
Where did he go?
So, I get down and hear crying.
Did he fall?
No, he was so upset that they took Dumbo's mother that he broke down in tears and ran to my mom.
Ah, that's cute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the older disney animation films?
Like how old? Original mickey mouse on the steamboat old?
I meant more the feature length films like snow white, cinderella, sleeping beauty era.
I like them still but they are very different form current ones.
Yes they are. They seem slower paced to me.
I think they may have been indeed. I like the music in them most.
That is something that is the same great scores from disney films.
So many iconic ones to be inspired by.
Well look even the soundbite Disney uses at the start of ilms is from pinnochio isn't it?
I think so... I believe it is, when you wish upon a star.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last Disney movie you saw?
Does Star Wars count?
Nah, let's say classic Disney animated movies only.
Hmmm, Frozen if you're going by the strict definition.
What do you mean by strict definition?
Well, if I google a list, Wikipedia gives me all sorts of Disney and Disney affiliated movies.
Yeah, like what?
Well, there's Zootopia, which was Disney but no princess. Plus Disney acquired Pixar so there's Finding Dory and the like.
Oh, and they own Marvel now too!
Yeah, hopefully we'll have some better female centric Marvel movies now that DC has raised the bar with Wonder Woman.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite of the three Toy Story movies?
My favorite is the original, for sure. I love the scenes when Buzz and Woody are at Sid's house.
I like the tea party scene when Buzz says "I am Mrs. Nesbitt!" Like he's brainwashed or something!
Which is your favorite of the three movies?
My favorite is Toy Story 2, because I like Jessie and Bullseye a lot.
I like all of the Al's Toy Barn scenes.
Even though Al was sort of a bad guy in the movie, his store did look like a lot of fun!
The song that Jessie sings is so sad, though!
It is. At least she ended up with a happy family that loves her.
Much better than being forced to ship off to a museum and never be played with!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the recent trend of Disney doing live-action remakes of their animated classics?
Yeah, I think so. Aren't they coming out with a new Beauty and the Beast remake?
Yup, it's going to star Emily Watson!
Um, you're thinking of Emma Watson. The girl who played Hermione in the Harry Potter movies.
Oh yea, that's right. So, do you think it's going to be any good?
Disney tends to have a decent track record with these things. Even if it's not better than the original, it probably won't be horrible.
Indeed, I heard they are keeping it pretty faithful to the original, even the promotional materials show Watson's Belle in that classic yellow dress.
I wouldn't know, I never actually watched the original.
You're kidding me right?
No, I was like only two years old when the original came out and my parents never bought me the tapes or DVDs when I was a kid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the most recent Disney movie you have seen?
Tangled.
Oh, I forgot about that one. That movie rocks.
Yeah, it is really funny and sad and innovative.
I can't stand that evil lady.
Yeah, she is very self centered.
I like the horse.
Yeah, he is a funny character.
What is your favorite scene?
When Rapunzel reunites with her mom and dad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Moana movie yet?
Yes, it was awesome that The Rock did the voice of the demi-god!
The songs in that movie were very catchy.
My kids loved the "Your welcome" song and sing it all the time.
It's one movie that we watch again and again.
It's on reply at our house too.
I loved the cultural side of the movie also.
It was fun to learn how they think creation started.
I liked how they portrayed the family unit in the culture.
Yes, where grandparents and parents help raise the children along with the village.
XXXXXXXXXXX
They need to do Sword in the Stone as a live action.
I doubt they'll do it.
Why do you say that.
King Arthur just came out.
But that happens all the time.
What?
One type of movie is released, then a dozen more just like it crop up.
True. They might do it.
Seems like they're doing everything else.
That would be a good one to bring back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Disney make any sci fi films?
I think Tomorrowland counts. Good flick.
Very entertaining. Time travel, right?
Well its a little more than that. It covers all kinds of technology.
And scientific developments.
George Clooney was cute the way he'd get bent out of shape.
He was good in that. Good father figure.
And there was a little girl robot!
Who dreamed that up? She was awesome.
I love the scenes. I'll never get tired of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to watch the Disney movie Moana with me?
Is that the movie with Dwayne Johnson in it?
Yes! The Rock voiced the character Maui in the movie.
Oh, I am a fan of Dwayne Johnson, the show sounds interesting.
You will love the movie, the show also features songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Lin-Manuel Miranda? The guy who wrote the musical "Hamilton"?
Yes! I love the song "You're Welcome" in the movie written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Maui's part was sang by Dwayne Johnson.
Well, now, I would really love to watch the movie now.
Great! I have the dvd at home. Drop by later in the afternoon.
Alright, I'll bring the popcorn.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of The Jungle Book?
It was quite good. I'm surprised how old it is actually.
Oh, what year was it from?
1967. My parents were still kids when it came out.
It holds up well. Great characters.
Baloo was always my favourite.
And Sher Khan was genuinely scary.
As any Bengal Tiger ought to be!
It was originally a Kipling novel wasn't it?
Yep. But Disney did it best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the remakes of some of the Disney Classics?
Yes I did.
Which ones were your favorite?
Alice in Wonderland, Beauty and the beast, and Malificent which was suppose to be the Snow White remake.
Those were my favorite too. I wish they would make one for Little Mermaid or Peter Pan.
Those would be great Disney remakes.
I think if they remade The Little mermaid the part where she turns her fin into legs would be the most crucial part.
I disagree, I think the part where she needs to kiss the prince before the sunset would be.
You're right, I think Jessica CHastain would make a great Ariel and Henry Cavil as Prince Eric.
Both great choices! I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Dead Man's Chest out yet?
It's in theaters I think
I hope I get to see it
it's a great time period movie
I hate that Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly aren't in it anymore
Yeah, I'm not sure why they left them out
The series has made a ton of money.
Yeah, the individual films all did well.
I wonder if they'lll make any more movies off Disney rides
They should
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the new movie Finest Hour is a Disney movie?
Yeah I watched it and saw their logo.
Was it any good I was thinking about watching it?
I found it to be pretty good it was very interesting.
Who plays in it and how long is the movie?
It's about 2 hours Chis Pine, Ben Foster, and Casey Affleck play the lead roles.
Those are all great actors what is it about?
It's set in the early 50's when a storm hits and the Coast Guard goes to rescue some people.
That sounds real interesting I may check it out.
You should I think you will enjoy it, it's on Netflix if you have it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ever catch Disney's Into the Woods?
Sure. It was really good.
With actresses I hadn't known could sing!
Emily Blunt, Meryl Streep, and Chris Pine!
It was a lot like the Broadway musical.
I really liked the story.
All the music was good too.
Some of the plot twists were really unexpected.
Chris Pine was a little goofy in his role.
Definitely not his usual role. Anna Kendrick was precious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So Moana came out on DVD and I didn't think much of it?
Really?  Why's that?
Well, I just didn't think the songs were as catchy as some other movies.
I don't quite agree with you.  They were unique and totally fit in with the movie.
I guess I was just expecting more.  The animation was pretty good though.
I kind of thought Maui was a bit too big though.
Really?  He's supposed to be larger than life.
Yeah, maybe it's just the Rock I don't like.
Everyone loves the Rock!
Everybody but me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't want to watch Disney movies tonight.
Why not?
Because! Snow White is just a girl that sleeps, I don't want to watch something about a toad, and I hate the snow!
You should really give them a chance. They're more than just sleeping girls and animals.
Really? Like what?
Well, Mulan, for instance. She saves an entire kingdom by herself.
Really? How?
Well, you'll have to watch it to find out.
Fine. I guess we can watch Mulan. But nothing else!
Let's watch Mulan, then. At least you're giving it a chance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We have been watching Rapuzel a lot lately.
Really? Guess someone at your house really likes it?
It is a cute movie. Pretty funny characters.
I have only see it once.
Paschal, the chameleon is great. I liked Max. He did not even have any lines but he was funny!
I need to invest it a frying pan. That was her weapon of choice, right?
Ha Ha! Yes, she knew how to use it too.
I wanted her to use it against Gothel.
The boat scene is my favorite.
Flynn and Rapunzel do make a cute couple.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get Beauty and the Beast on DVD?
Blu-Ray actually.  Emma Watson's voice sounds more beautiful on it?
Really?  I wouldn't think it would matter.
It sounds even crisper and more lovely to my ears.
Wow, interesting to know.
And the Beast's Evermore also sounds better.  I recommend it.
I love that song!  So heartbreaking.
And Dan Stevens sings it with such emotion.
Just thinking about it makes me want to cry!
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I love Cinderella.
Me too.  I'm a big fan of any of the princess movies.
I love Sleeping Beauty too.
That's a good one.  I really love Snow White.  Such a great movie!
What other Disney movies do you like?
I like Frozen.  The songs in that movie are pretty good.
I agree.  I don't think there is a single little girl out there that doesn't wish she was Elsa!
I remember always wishing I was Ariel from Little Mermaid when I was growing up.
I always wanted to be Jasmine from Aladdin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been rewatching all the old Disney movies lately.
Oh nice! Which one was your favorite?
I always really like Pocahontas.
Oh me too, that was a great one. I loved the Colors of the Wind song.
What was your favorite?
I really like the newer movies like Frozen, the songs are so good.
Me too, that was definitely a good one but I like the classics.
Agreed, it is always good to go back and see the old ones for nostalgia.
I really loved the Hunchback of Notre Dame as a kid too it's crazy watching it as an adult.
Oh yeah, that one has a lot of themes I didn't pick up as a kid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When are they going to make a sleeping beauty remake?
They kind of already did.
What do you mean?  I haven't seen anything about it.
Maleficent.  Came out a few years ago, remember?
Well, that's not really a true sleeping beauty movie.
Of course it is.  Just a different perspective.
That movie was kind of dark and mysterious.  I want something lighter.
You can't make all movies all rainbows and unicorns though.
It frightened my daughter quite a bit.
She'll probably really like it when she's older.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you notice that TV never plays any of the really good Disney movies?
Yeah! I haven't seen Mulan 2 for years, not to mention The Lion King.
mostly they play the old movies, like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty.
Ugh, Sleeping Beauty is terrible.
Why so? I like it.
She doesn't actually do anything! All she really does is sing and dance.
Hmm, I guess you're right. But you've gotta admit, Prince Phillip was pretty cool.
Yeah, he was really heroic  and the epitome of a knight in shining armor.
The villain, Maleficent, was also very realistic.
Yes, the battle between her and Prince Phillip was extremely memorable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard Mulan was getting remade into a Live Action movie.
Oh yeah, When?
I believe 2018.
2018? That seems rather far away.
Yeah, but we should go see it. I love Mulan.
That sounds good. I'm interested in seeing it in theaters.
I don't think I've ever seen a Disney film in theaters before.
Never?
Not that I can recall. I don't usually go to movie releases in theaters.
Oh, then we're definitely going. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay what was your favorite Disney movie growing up?
Oooh this is a tough question! I'm going to have to go with The Little Mermaid.
Yeah Ariel was a pretty cool chick. And the songs in that movie were so good!
Did you know that The Little Mermaid won a Golden Globe for its original score?
I didn't know that! That's amazing.
So what was your favorite?
I loved Beauty and the Beast. I must have watched that movie 50 times.
Beauty and the Beast has the best characters in it! Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip! So my good ones!
Agreed! And I loved that Belle really loved reading cause I loved reading when I was little too.
And that she didn't like Gaston! He was such a bro.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Avenger is Captain America!
Why?
He's awesome! He's all about freedom, and fighting Nazis, and his shield is really cool!
I like Iron Man. Tony Stark can be a bit rough around the edges, but he's got brains! He fights with what he makes himself!
He kind of took the wrong side during Civil War.
He had a point, though, it's easy to go too far. When you fight monsters, you have to make sure you don't become a monster too.
That's true, but who decides what's right? The Government? If the law says you have to hurt some people and you know it's wrong, you have to go against the law to do what's right.
That's a good point.
That's why Captain America fought against Iron Man. Tony was going overboard to protect everyone because he was scared and it was compromising everyone's freedom. Plus, Hydra had taken over SHIELD.
Man, Marvel's pretty deep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Disney is going to put out a live-action version of Mulan?
Yeah, I heard! Who do you think they'll cast as Mulan?
I have no idea. I hope they bring Eddie Murphy back to voice Mushu though.
Agreed!
I'm really looking forward to the battle scenes.
Same! It'll definitely be different from Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast.
I've heard Disney is going to do a live-action version of Aladdin as well.
Awesome! I'd love to see Zayn Malik portray Aladdin.
Why? He can sing, but he only has one facial expression: the smolder.
True. They'll have to cast someone new, I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the cartoon Disney films, or the live action ones?
I like them both. But, the cartoons seem to be the best.
What about the Pixar ones?
I love those too.
If you had to pick, which ones would you go with?
I cannot decide. There are so many underrated live action ones.
Like what?
Fuzzbucket is great.
I've never seen that one.
It's about a boy who has an imaginary friend and then he comes to life!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have your kids watched the Lion King movie yet?
Yes they have.
Did they like it?
Yes, they loved the movie.  They especially love the music.
Overall it is a good movie, but I don't like the sad part where Mufasa dies.
I agree.  It is very hard for kids to understand that part of the movie.
We try to focus on the cute animals and music.  But my kids do get confused during the sad part.
I wish there weren't so many deaths in Disney movies.  Since they are supposed to be for kids.
At least it has a happy ending.
Yes that's true!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you familiar with Mary Poppins?
It's one of my favorites.
Have you seen Saving Mr. Banks?
I haven't heard of it. What's it about?
It's the true story as to how Walt Disney acquired the rights to Mary Poppins.
It sounds interesting.
There's also a sequel to Mary Poppins coming out.
That's news to me.
IIt's supposed to come out in 2018.
I would see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I thought I cried hard for Lilo and Stitch, but the kids and I watched Bambi today...
Oh goodness yes.  That one is a heart breaker.
I went and chopped onions, so the kids would think that was why I was crying.
Did it work?
Yes, but now I don't know what to do with this huge pile of chopped onions.
I remember when my mom took me to see Bambi for the first time.  I tried to be cool and not cry.
When it was re-released in theaters?  My parents took me too.
I didn't want to go because it was, you know, a kids movie.  I was 12, and figured I was too grown up.
Yes, at 12 I thought I was too grown up for Disney too.  But here we are, fully grown, and still watching Disney.
Right! Not only watching Disney, by choice, but loving it too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Zootopia?
That was such a cute movie! My kids love it too.
I was surprised by the social commentary I found underlying the message.
Oh it was definitely in your face. Secret Life of Pets was another good one too.
That reminded me a lot of Toy Story, the way they have their own separate lives from adults.
You know the bunny in Secret Life of Pets? Kevin Hart did the voice.
Oh I knew he sounded familiar. Have you seen BFG yet?
Oh that was surprisingly good, I loved it. The giant was so sweet.
Yes and Steven Spielberg directed it.
You can definitely tell, his hallmark lighting is all over it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that a new Cars movie is finally coming out?
yes but not until July 14th 2017.
It is coming close and i cant wait.
I feel like people dont remeber what happened on the other ones.
I dont know about that it was a very funny movie
yeah i know what you meen i think matter made the movie
yeah i know what you meen he was my favorit charecter
i hope that they bring matter back into the movie
i am sure they will
i will be the fisrt one in the door when it opens
XXXXXXXXXXX
Toy Story has gone too far.
I know. I wish they had stopped after the second.
Right? And I hear they're doing another movie!
No way! Who's even asking for that? All the original toy story fans are old as heck now!
I know! I'm one of 'em
I guess I miss Slink. If he's in it, I won't complain too much
Yeah, but Andy's grown up. what's the point?
I just realized...we're andy. we're all grown up.
Oh my god. you're right.
andy represents the audience! Insane
XXXXXXXXXXX
I told my mom last night I thought what she said was disgusting, and she just laughed at me.
What? Why was what she said disgusting?
She was talking about how her neighbor brought her deer meat, and how much she loved it. I told her that was disgusting.
So she laughed at you?
She laughed cause I said how could you eat Bambi?
Oh, that Disney movie Bambi really was touching.
I cried so hard when Bambi's mother got shot in that movie. I was only seven, and I have never forgot that moment.
I know, that seems like too sensitive for something in a kid's movie.
I loved Bambi, and his little friend the skunk Flower, and his little friend the rabbit Thumper. I don't know how anyone could eat Bambi.
I know what you mean, I've never eaten deer either. They're too cute to eat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Old Yeller.
The old Disney classic?
Yes, 1957.
Who directed it?
Robert Stevenson
Who played the little boy?
Arliss was played by Kevin Corcoran.  Scene stealer.
Right.  Who was the older boy?
Tommy Kirk.
I saw him in Shaggy Dog.  Those were the days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What movie do you like better?
Tangled or frozen?
Definitely frozen
They are both good
What about you
Frozen, but i really enjoyed tangled too
The songs were better in frozen
Yes but i really liked that mother knows best song too
The one from tangled?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the little short feature film based on the Disney movie Frozen that's coming out in November?
No, what's it called?
Olaf's Frozen Adventure. It's only 21 minutes long, but it sounds cute.
Oh, Olaf was the cute little snowman. He cracked me up when he kept dreaming of what summer would be like.
In this one, he's gathering up the best holiday traditions for Anna, Elsa, and Kristoff.
So all those original characters will be in it? That sounds like fun!
There's going to be four new original songs in it too.
When does it come out?
November 22, 2017. Right in time for the Christmas holidays.
It's a Frozen Christmas present!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana yet?
Yes! I think it might be my new favorite movie.
Me too! Who is your favorite character?
Definitely Maui. He is my hero. Who's yours?
I like the chicken... He's an interesting character.
I agree, I do like him too!
Did you know that the girl who does the voice for Moana had never acted before?
No, but she has a great voice. She was a good find!
She was. I love it when they can find new talent like that!
Me too! I'm excited to see if she will show up in any more movies now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am excited about the new Toy Story movie.
There's a new Toy Story movie?
Yes, it will come out in a couple years.
Wow, that is exciting.
I wonder what is gonna happen?
Yeah, since Andy is grown up. I'm not sure what else they can do.
They will probably use that girl from the last one.
Maybe. Do you think it will be good?
Yes, but the first is the best.
Oh, I love the first one. It is so innovative.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?
I surely have. Classic movie.
Indeed it was. Do you know if it was hand-drawn? I don't think it was computer animated.
I'm not sure, but I'd say hand draw. Gorgeous illustration though.
Terrific music too. Who was your favourite character?
Oh, definitely Gaston. He reminds me of myself.
Ha! Hyper macho and manly?
You forgot 'devastatingly handsome.' I was rooting for him to win.
That's ridiculous. The Beast is so charming... personality issues aside.
I suppose. But Belle never did much for me either way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the real to life Beauty and the Beast with Emma Watson?
I haven't. I liked the classic one though.
I liked that one, but the real to life one is pretty awesome.
I will have to check it out. What Disney movies do you like?
My favorite of all time is The Lion King.
That's a great movie, I love the music.
Jonathan Taylor Thomas voiced Simba as a cub. He was a cute character.
He was. I thought the death scene of Mufasa was so sad though.
When he fell off the cliff? Yes, that was brutal to watch.
I love that he came alive again in the stars though, that was sweet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen frozen
Yes
Did you like it
I loved it
My favorite part was when elsa made the ice castle
That was a good part
What was yours?
I liked when ana met the troll family
That was really funny
Yes it was
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana?
I have not. Have you?
No. But I want to. It looks really good.
Do you know the premise behind it?
Not exactly. I think it has to do with her wanting to be on the ocean.
I've heard the songs from it. They are really good but not as good as frozen.
I don't know.  I personally think they are better, we just haven't heard them as much.
Yeah, Frozen was wverywhere for awhile.
I think it helped that they had a Broadway star singing the main song.
Oh true. Idina Menzel was amazing!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember when I was about ten I went to see The Incredible Journey in the movie theater with my parents.
I remember that. The one with the dogs and the cat?
Yes, they got separated from their owners, I think they were moving .
Yes and I think they were lost in the Canadian Wilderness.
They were. They had a lot of obstacles to overcome to get home.
I remember the cat getting lost or something.
Yes the cat did but in the end the cat found his or maybe it was a her way home.
I remember they all did make it home.
I think it is really similar to Milo and Otis.
Yes it is, that is probably the newer version.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Fantasia is the weirdest Disney movie ever.
That's the one where Mickey Mouse is a wizard right.
Yeah, it's got that iconic scene where he's trying to use magic to clean his castle.
And then all the brooms go crazy and start doing a weird army march.
And the castle ends up flooding because he uses too much magic or something like that.
It's got a really fantastic musical score as well, but I agree it's totally weird.
Doesn't Mickey Mouse's dog, Pluto, make a totally out of place cameo appearance.
I think so but I can't remember too much about it.
Ha ha me neither but I always used to listen to the soundtrack to fall asleep.
Ha ha that's almost as weird as the film itself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are your favorite non-main characters in Disney movies?
Oh, like not Aladdin or Woody?
Yeah, like in Beauty and the Beast, I like Belle's dad.
Oh sure he was funny, and invented some really interesting things.
Yeah, so who is one of your favorites?
Oh, I like the side kick characters best, like the crab in The Little Mermaid.
Do you mean Sebastian?
Yes, his song was one of the best in the whole movie.
That's true - he really added a lot of fun and humor into The Little Mermaid.
Yeah, I think that's what the side kicks do best, is to be able to add jokes to the movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any Disney movies lately?
Hannah Montana movie is what I saw.
Oh how was that movie?
It was kind of cheesy.
I would expect that from Disney. How was the singing?
Miley Cyrus is talented so that was good.
Did it sound fake?
Not that much.
Good I will check it out.
Sounds like a plan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Jungle Book?
No. What is it?
It's a Disney movie about a boy that's raised by animals in the jungle.
You mean like that other movie about the guy raised by apes?
Kind of. Except This one a boy is raised by wolves.
What's the difference?
Well, the boys name is Mowgli. He's raised by wolves, but he has to leave home when a Tiger comes after him. The movie is about his adventure away from home.
Why does the Tiger come after him?
I don't want to give too much away. You should watch the movie.
I'll check it out when I have time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of Toy Story 4 coming out?
Yes! I am super pumped.
I think my kids would love to see it.
Mine would too.
We should plan a movie date and watch it. Are they the same actors?
I would assume so. Tom Hanks being Woody as normal.
Tim Allen stars in the movie also. I wonder who produces them.
I am unsure who produces the others but I know this one, Galyn Susman produced it.
That name sounds familiar. Did John Lasseter still direct it or no?
Yes, along with Josh Cooley.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie of all times??
I would have to say the Lion KIng. Simba was so adorable.
Yes, I love that movie. I still cry every time.
I really want to see the new Beauty & the Beast.
Oh isn't that girl from Harry Potter in it?
Yes, I think it looks good. I need to see Frozen, I haven't seen that one yet.
I really love the classics like Cinderella and 101 Dalmations.
I remember having the VHS tapes with the heavy duty plastic cases.
Oh I think they might be worth money now a days.
I sold them all at a garage sale, I'm going to check on eBay to see how much they're worth.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Frozen.
Did you like it?
Not even a little bit.
What! It was one of the most successful Disney movies ever.
Yes, but it was also boring.
You did not even like Sven?
I did not like the little snowman person.
He was so cute!
The movie made no sense, why did she not just wear gloves the whole time.
She was a kid, she did not know any better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the real life Cinderella movie?
I did see it and thought it was really good. I loved the character of Cinderella.
I really liked how it made me feel after. I loved how Cinderella was focused on being couragesly kind.
Ya I remember her saying that. I liked how they showed the backstory of Cinderella and told more about her father.
It makes me want to watch the movie again right now.
I know I was thinking the same thing. I like how Disney is doing this with other movies too.
Oh ya like The Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast.
Ya I think Cinderella was still my favorite.
I agree Beauty and the Beast was good but not as good as Cinderella.
Ya I agree I didn't like the Beast as well as I did the Prince in Cinderella.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you noticed how it's... kind of hard to find a Disney movie without some kind of obvious racism in it?
I, um. Which movies are we talking about?
Like, almost all of them. Have you seen Dumbo lately?
Not in the last few hours, no.
There's that whole opening sequence with the black workers and the song they sing -- and then toward the end, those crows... Jesus.
Hmm. I don't really remember any of this. I'll have to take a look, later.
It's painful, seriously. And what about Lady and the Tramp, with the Siamese cats, and the Italians?
Oh, those cats creeped me out as a kid. Yeah, uh.
They're well-done, but boy is that stuff problematic.
I guess I see what you mean.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you a big fan of the Lion King?
Not really.  My mom was all into it though.
Your mom?
Yeah, she took us to go see it in the theatre.  I was almost in high school.
Yikes.  That must have been embarrassing.
Yeah, and then we were on vacation and she made my dad buy the soundtrack.
Wow.  Did you guys listen to it nonstop?
Yes.  I hated it.
Well, there are some good songs.
I tell you, I love Elton John, but I don't ever want to hear Can You Feel the Love Tonight again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the saddest Disney movie?
Bambi
Is that an old movie?
Yes
Is it very sad?
Yes. Bambi's mother gets killed
That is awful
Yeah. It is a hard one to watch
I like the classics a lot?
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Disney buying Star Wars?
I think it's a good move. They have the money to do great things.
I'm sure the casting and graphics will be amazing.
Do you think it loses something by becoming so commercial?
I think it started to lose it's specialness when they did episodes 1-3.
Oh, come on! Episodes 2 and 3 were pretty good.
The dialogue was atrocious.
I think you have to step back and see it differently. Anakin and Padme were teenagers. Their angsty dialogue fits.
And then Padme dies in childbirth for no reason but a broken heart?
No, the Emperor sucked her life force to save Anakin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you know that the the movie Cars 3 with be in cinemas soon?
Yes, I knew that
Will you come with me to watch it?
I don't know yet, Cars 2 were very disapointing movie for me
Yes, Cars 2 were not very good, bur Cars were ok.
Yes, First parts are always the best
I think is more similar to Cars 1 than to Cars 2
I hope so
So we can go
Ok, it will be nice
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved watching Disney movies when I was younger.
I still watch them now.
I have a few that I will watch even if the kids are not in the room.
Me too.  And sing along!
Yes, the Disney songs are true Classics.
Every movie has that one song that pulls it together.
But sometime you get real tired of hearing it over and over.
"would you like to build a snow man?'
Funny!
You know you want to sing the rest of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Disney movie when you were growing up?
I'd probably have to say Lady and the Tramp.
What makes you pick that one?
I remember it so well from my childhood. I really liked some of the songs too.
Did it make you want a dog of your own?
Of course it did. Wouldn't all children want a dog after watching it?
What was your favorite part of the movie?
I liked it when the tramp broke into the house to save the baby from the rat.
Didn't the people think the tramp was a bad dog?
Aunt Sara certainly did, but everything turned out in the end when they realized he was protecting the baby.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get a chance to see the Tron sequel?
No not yet, is it any good?
I thought it was pretty awesome. Did you see the original?
Ya a long time ago when I was a kid.
Yes Jeff Bridges is in this one to.
Oh really, he is a great actor.
Yes and the special effects are really good in this one.
I bet; a lot better than when the first one came out I imagine.
Yes - but it has the same look to it as the original.
Awesome! I will have to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The boys and I are trying to figure out what to watch tonight. I miss the good old family movies, like you could watch on Sunday night by Disney.
Oh, forgot about that, it was called "Wonderful World of Disney" I looked forward to it all week. What was your favorite Disney movie?
One of my favorites was a really old one.. "Swiss Family Robinson"
We watched that one too! We always said we wished we would get shipwrecked so we could live like them.
And the parent trap! We loved that one. Good old fashioned stuff you didn't have to worry about watching with your kids.
Yeah, Disney has done alot of good family movies. Toy Story will always be my favorite.
Yes, I think we've watched all 3 a zillion times.
Although Inside Out comes close. It was so funny and real.
Yeah, we loved that one too.  I heard they are doing an Incredibles 2. That would be so cool.
No way! I love that one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Disney should make a new princess movie.
Totally! I love princess movies.
I wish they'd do the Princess and the Pea.
What about the Twelve Dancing Princesses?
I dunno. That's too complicated.
Yeah, but I bet Disney could do it.
I think they should remake the Little Mermaid as a live action movie.
They're doing a lot of remakes these days.
I know, because everyone loves them.
True. Anything princess is gonna sell.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw where a new Aladdin should be coming to theater soon.
That was my favortie Disney movie growing up, so I hope it's true.
Well I read that the true date hasn't been announced, but summer of 2018 is time period.
Well I'm so excited. I just love the storyof Aladdin and Jasmine.
I wonder who they will get to play the Genie since the great Robin Williams is no longer with us.
I don't know! It will be different without him, but I'm sure they have a great plan.
It would be nice if they kept most of the same old cast. It would really help it feel like the original.
Oh yes, it really never is the same when they replace the whole cast. Well as long as they keep with the fantastic effects, it should be a hit.
I just hope they keep with the action and romance so it'll be fun for the whole family.
Disney always had great sequels, so I can't wait to see this in theaters soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Disney's Tangled was surprisingly hilarious.
I haven't seen it yet. What's it about?
It's a retold story based on the Rapunzel fairy tale.
I'll make sure I try it out with the kids soon!
It's an older Disney film, but my kids still love it because it's a musical and the songs are so catchy.
That's great, something to keep the kids entertained.
A few encounters with a horse that my baby thinks is hilarious but it has darker themes.
Disney has started to move towards a little bit of darker material. I like it.
It can be overwhelming for the kids sometimes. It usually makes a better ending though.
Exactly, they get all sad until the ending and then they're happy everything works out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the most beautiful Disney princess?
Ariel
Really?
Yes. I love her
What about Belle?
Belle is beautiful too. But, my number one is Ariel
She is a great character
I love her red hair
Yeah, that is very unique
She has a beautiful voice as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I see where Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales has broken into the top 100 box office hits of all time.
What number is it at?
It's currently at number 97.
Do you think it will get higher?
Absolutely, the Pirates movies usually do pretty well at the box office.
Which one has done the highest?
Dead Man's Chest made the most money and is at number twenty one.
It  must have made a lot of money.
Over a billion dollars.
Wow. That is a lot of money.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think a new Wreck-it Ralph is coming out soon?
I heard.
I wonder when though because I have been hearing this-
Since last year! I know!
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
I think it is either coming out later this year or at the beginning of next.
Cool, I can't wait to see Vanellope again.
I know, any idea what it's about.
No details yet from what I here.
I think it will be awesome nonetheless.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you watched Beauty and the Beast yet?
The original one or the one with Emma Watson?
Emma Watson! The newest one.
Oh yeah, I've seen it already. I loved it.
Same! I love the feeling you get when you watch Disney movies!
What do you mean?
They just feel so comforting and familiar I guess.
I know exactly what you mean! The introduction is my favorite part.
When the fireworks fly over the castle it just feels so good!
I wish I could always feel that way!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the first Disney movie you ever saw?
Snow White, my grandma took me.
That's awhile ago.
It was the 80s and she loved it.
I think mine was Sleeping Beauty.
I hated the ugly stepsisters.
The little mice in Sleeping Beauty were cute.
I like the animals in Bambi.
Bambi was sad though.
Yeah but Thumper and Bambi were cute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Disney Character?
I always loved Goofy.
Did you see the goofy movie in the 90s?
A Goofy movie from 1995 was a great favorite of mine.
Max was such a good character.
It did tend to focus more on him than Goofy , but still so good.
I also liked the sidekick friend.P.J. Pete
Pete the father is such a good villain type character.
I feel like in these they made him a little nicer than disney's old cartoons.
Well the original cartoons were less developed in general.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Fantasia?
Do you mean the old version or the more recent one.
The original, not Fantasia 2000.
I did.  It was alright I guess.
What was your favorite segment?
The Mickey one with all the brooms.
That was kind of an iconic scene.
Overall, the movie isn't really a movie, just a cobbled together stretch of scenes.
They're good to see every now and then.
Yeah, but not something to watch on repeat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw The Lion King last night.
The Disney animated movie?
Yes, 1994.
Who directed it?
Roger Allers Rob Minkoff
Who did Simba as a kid?
Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
And as an adult?
Matthew Broderick.
Scar was fascinating.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite movies when I was little was Mary Poppins.
That was a great disney movie.
I remember my parents took me to see it in the movie theater.
It starred Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.
Yes, they were too great actors!
Julie Andrews has a great voice The songs were good too.
Yea, a Spoon full of Sugar and Chim chimerie
I liked the part when the rain washed the chalk off the sidewalk in the park.
Yea that was good.
I like how she flew with her umbrella.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well you know of my fear of Ursula from "The Little Mermaid" and Chernabog from "Fantasia." What was the creepiest thing you saw in a Disney movie?
I think that would have to be Cruella De Ville from "100 Dalmations."
Why Cruella? Sure she seems crazy but what about her?
Well she wanted to make clothes out of those puppies!
I think the fact that she wanted to kidnap puppies in general is pretty terrifying.
Monster of a feat by the way, kidnapping that many puppies.
I know right, she had to have known it wasn't going to work out.
Exactly, there are 100 of them and one of her?
Well no, I think she had henchman.
I think you're right, she had two from what I can remember.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Auli'i Cravalho casted as Moana.
I didn't know that. But I knew that Dwayne Johnson casted as Maui.
Sina was my favorite character.
My favorite was Gramma Tala.
Gramma Tala was very funny.
I know right. She made more jokes than Cheif Tui.
And I loved their songs.
Especially "How far I'll go".
I want to watch it again.
My instincts tell me that they will release a new one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My daughter's 4th birthday is coming up and she wants a Disney princess party.
My daughter just went to one last month. It was pretty cute.
You should bring her! Kayla is dressing as her favorite Disney princess, Ariel.
Isabelle would love that! She'll probably go as Belle, her favorite because of the name.
Oh, there are so many more reasons to like Belle! She's my favorite!
She's an avid reader just like me. And she doesn't fall for just any guy.
Exactly! Gaston had no chance!
There is so much you can learn from Belle too! Like the importance of family, and reading.
And staying true to yourself, no matter what people think.
And of course, how to look beyond someone's exterior, because you never know what "beast" may turn out to be your true love!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember your first animated Disney movie growing up?
It's hard to recall, but I think it was either the 1938 Snow White and the Seven Dwarves or the 1942 Bambi. What about yourself?
Probably either One Hundred and One Dalmatians or The Sword in The Stone.
Sword in the Stone and Robin Hood were, and still are, among my favorite.
Mine also. Really need to go back and watch some of these Disney classics.
After binge watching Once Upon a Time I've had an itch to do the same. Probably start with Sleeping Beauty or Peter Pan.
Peter Pan is another personal favorite, and I loved Robin Williams portrayal of Peter in Hook.
Hook was great and I'm still heartbroken about Robin Williams passing away. Still fondly remember seeing him in Flubber in theaters with the family.
That's awesome! Think the only live action Disney movie I've seen in theaters, besides a Star Wars or Marvel Comics one, was One Hundred and One Dalmatians.
Another nicely done live action Disney film. I was tickled to death when I found out the actors who played Gregory House and Arthur Weasley were in it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Toy Story?
Growing up that was always my favorite Disney movie!
Who was your favorite character?
As a kid I always wanted to be a cowboy, so obviously I really related with Woody.
I always wanted to be an astronaut so I really loved Buzz Lightyear!
I use to have the Buzz Lightyear action figure, I could never find Woody in stores.
That's because he was the star of the movie and everyone loved Woody!
Loved? Now that they have made Toy Story sequels kids still love Woody!
That's a really good point!
We should have a Toy Story marathon and relive our childhood!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Disney's The BFG, did you?
No but I heard about it. How did you like it?
It was pretty amazing in its animation.
The previews looked great!
And the story was great too.
What happened in it?
An orphan girl meets giants, is kidnapped, meets the Queen, and saves the country.
That sounds like a long story.
Yeah the movie was long. Funny too.
I'll take a look at the original book.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There are some days when I feel like Tarzan.
Great film but what do you mean.
You know sometimes you find yourself in a jungle in just a loincloth.
What with a beautiful lady named Jane, a pack of gorillas and Phil Collins singing love songs.
Ha ha, yeah something like that. It is such a good film though.
Yeah, I heard they were making a sequel.
No way, when's it out.
Not too sure, just saw some rumours on the internet.
I hope they make a sequel.
If they do, you'd be ready made to play the elephant. Ha ha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast Movie?
No I haven't. Is it any good?
It was fantastic! I expected it to be worse than the original, but I was surprised.
Why did you expect that?
Remakes are usually pretty bad in my opinion, but not this one.
So what did you like the most about it?
The Beast had the most beautiful singing voice! There isn't a song for The Beast in the original.
Seriously? I didn't know that!
Yeah, it's such a shame. The song added so much.
I bet. I will definitely have to go see the movie soon since you got me so interested in it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favourite Disney Princess?
Yes, my favourite one is Princess Jasmine from the movie Aladdin.
Cool! She is my favourite too, I love that movie!
Do you know when that movie was released?
I think it was some time in the 90's, but I can't be sure.
Yea that's what I would guess too.
I remember watching Aladdin as a child and always being amazed by his flying carpet.
Tell me about it, I need a flying carpet of my own!
That would be so cool, I'd never be late to anything.
Maybe a genie of my own too! I could use 3 wishes!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about the Little Mermaid movie?
Oh  I love it and Ariel is one of my favorite princesses.
Oh really, why?
I love how she sings and her red bright hair.
What else do you like about her movie?
I like that she has a lot of sisters and her desire to become human.
Do you think she should had trusted Ursula?
Not a bit! If she was more open with her dad she could have avoided lots of danger.
But at the end she got her happy ending, right?
Yes! Just that her dad is going to miss her very much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any silent films from Disney?
Fantasia does not have talking
Is that good?
Yes, it is wonderful
Who is in it?
Mickey Mouse
Cool!
It's very good.
When was it released?
In the 40's
XXXXXXXXXXX
My kids keep asking to watch Disney movies.
I love Disney movies! What are you watching now?
Now it's Moana.
Oh, I loved that! I loved the strong female lead.
Yeah, it isn't too bad. It makes me want to go on vacation somewhere tropical.
The ending is really fun. And those songs will be stuck in your head.
This chicken is cracking me up, I have to admit!
Yeah, there are some really funny parts. You will like it by the end, I promise!
Well, like all Disney movies, I'm sure I will have learned a lesson.
You are right! There's always a good moral!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard that they're making live action versions of a lot of old Disney movies!
I heard that as well! I love the cartoon versions but can't imagine how they are going to re-create some of them.
Have you seen the most recent Beauty and the Beast?
No, I haven't but I would like to. I really like Emma Watson.
I wonder who they would cast for the live action Ariel in the Little Mermaid!
I have no idea! What about Sebastian the crab?
I don't know that either.  I was thinking maybe someone like Ariana Grande for Ariel. She has a lovely singing voice.
She could work... She would have to wear a red wig though. I bet the songs would be beautiful with her voice.
She sang a song on the Beauty and the Beast soundtrack.
Yes, I heard the song! It was great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember when the Little Mermaid was released?
I kind of remember when it was popular.
I'm thinking it was in the late 80s?
Yeah, that sounds about right.  I was in elementary school.
Did you like it?
I never really watched it.  They did show it one time on a free day at school.
So you watched it then?
Not really.  I didn't really care for it.
You must have been the only kid not watching it.
Yeah, pretty much.  Everyone loves Disney.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched Disney's Sleeping Beauty?
Yes. It is actually one of my favorite Disney movies.
Prince Phillip is my favorite Prince out of any Disney Princess movie.
I love the part where he is singing to Aurora in the woods. What's that song again?
That song is Once Upon a Dream.
That's right and she is dancing with the owl and the cape before she realizes he is there.
He really is a great Prince, you know he's one of the few that actually plays an active role in the movie.
That's why I like him, he battles a dragon to save her that's pretty heroic.
I wonder if they plan on doing a live action movie.
They did Maleficent, but I don't know if they are actually going to do Sleeping Beauty.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Tangled?
Yes, I have, it is one of my favorite recent Disney movies!
I think it is as good as Frozen, really.
Frozen has a few more good songs than Tangled, but I like the story and characters better in Tangled.
I agree with that. "I See the Light" is a really good song, though.
I love the way it looks when they are under all of the lanterns on the water!
I also like how the girls in the village braid Rapunzel's hair shortly before that.
That is a cute scene, with Flynn and Rapunzel dancing with the villagers.
I'm glad Rapunzel ended up getting away from Mother Gothel.
Yes, it's a good thing she left her tower!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really miss the older Disney movies.
Me too. Cinderella was one of my favorites when I was a kid.
I know! And Sleeping Beauty was so great!
Sleeping Beauty was one that I watched all the time too!
Disney never gets old either. I love their new movies too.
I know what you mean. Every movie that Disney puts out I seem to love.
I agree, it's like they can't make a bad movie! Aladdin was amazing!
I know, the soundtrack was awesome too!
I agree. All the soundtracks in the newer movies of Disney's are all amazing.
I could just re-listen to the songs and recite the movies almost by heart!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the new Disney film, Coco.
I've never heard of it; when does it come out?
It looks great and it comes out in November.
Are there even trailers out for it yet?
I saw a couple on YouTube and it's about a boy in Mexico learning about his family's history.
That could be interesting, but maybe too deep for children.
There will be plenty of music and the animation is amazing!
As long as my kids can see it then it'll be good, they really really love movies with music.
The main theme of this movie will be around music and family.
Then we'll have to go see it when it comes out in November.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched The Lion King last night.
A blast from the past. I like that movie.
Me too. Not only the movie, but the music too.
That has to be one of the best Disney movies.
Yeah, who are those two characters he makes friends with.
Timone and Pumba.
Tha's them. You'd think I'd remember their names.
Scar deserved what he got.
There's a Scar in everyone's life, isn't there?
Yes there is. I know I have one in my family.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched Toy Story?
Of course, who hasn't!?
Doesn't it make you wish your childhood toys could have come to life?
Yes, definitely!
Did you have any of the same toys as in the movie?
I had a Mr. Potato Head and a slinky, but just a plain slinky, no dog head or tail. How about you?
I had both of those too. I even had a cowboy doll, but it looked a little different than Woody.
Do you think it would have freaked you out to see your toys come to life?
Maybe at first, but then it would have been pretty awesome!
Who knows, maybe all our toys really did come to life but we never knew about it just like Andy didn't!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have to admit something to you.
Oh yeah. Confess away!
You know how I constantly make Bambi jokes. I've never seen Bambi!
Your secret is safe with me. Your jokes always made sense so I never questioned it.
Oh good! I'm glad it wasn't obvious that I hadn't seen it.
It definitely wasn't obvious. I do the same thing with a few Disney movies.
Really, what do you do?
I always make jokes about the spaghetti kissing scene in Lady and the Tramp.
Me too! But I actually saw that movie.
I've seen a clip of that part. I think it'd be much messier in person.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new movie Moana?
Yes it is so good, i love it.
I want to see the new Disney movie  Jungle Book It's seems interstanting.
yes it is, I saw it and I love the characters and special kaa.
I am so excited for watch the new finding Dory movie.
Yeah me too, I love the parts of Destiny, and now there are some new characters.
I know your favorite Disney movie is ariel, so what is your favorite part of the movie?
I love when she sings, and when she finally got legs.
so what do you think about the new Disney's movies ?
They are good, but I always going to be fanatic of the originals one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Sleeping Beauty?
Yes, used to rent it all the time as a child.
Me too. I used to love that movie
Animation was quite different vs today
Yes, style was very 1950s.
I think it still holds up to today's standards
Even more so in some ways.
Yeah, everything is so digital now-a-days
Agree, some of the old style animation is really neat to see now
Yes, they just don't make them like they used to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite kind of Disney movies?
I enjoy movies that teach a lesson.  What about you?
I like those kind too, but I really like the ones that are funny.
Me too!  I like those better than my own kids.
Really though, it seems like the jokes are for more of a mature mind.
I agree, it goes right over my kids heads.
Why do you think they make the jokes so hard for kids to understand?
They probably do it for us parents.
Yes, you're probably right.
They probably do it because they know that we will have to watch it a million times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of the girl in Peter Pan?
You must be talking about Wendy.
No, the fairy.  Who was the fairy?
Tinkerbell?
Yes, Tinkerbell.  That's who I'm thinking of.
How can you forget Tink?  She's iconic and had about five other movies made of her.
I'm not the Disney aficionado that you are.
I know my Disney.  Even those that don't know Disney know Tinkerbell.
Well, now I've been educated properly.  You must be proud of yourself.
Very proud of myself.  I'm a champ!
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you like frozen?
it was okay. my kid loved it.
dude, I loved it myself.
how come?
it brought on so many feelings.
in what scene?
for me, the do you want to build a snowman part.
that song is so catchy
its better than let it go.
i think so too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that new Disney movie Moana?
Yes! My kids and I love that movie!
So much better than Frozen isn't it?
I am glad that they hype for that one has finally died down.
Same here, although my favorite Disney movie will always be The Little Mermaid.
I have always loved Beauty and the Beast.
Well, have you seen the live action Beauty and the Beast?
Yes! I think they did a wonderful job creating it.
I thought so too, and Emma was such a wonderful choice for Bell.
I don't think they could have chose better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So did you know the first Disney movie came out 80 years ago?
No.  Which one was it?
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Don't you mean dwarves?
No.  It is dwarfs.
Dwarfs?
Yes.  The term dwarves was actually coined by Tolkien, you know The Hobbit etc., about 80 years ago as well.  He said it gave his dwarves a dignity that regular dwarfs could hardly attain.
So Sneezy and Dopey were not dignified?
I guess not.  But they have sure been glorified.  Have you seen the outside of the Disney building?  The dwarfs are featured sculptures.
Well, I guess there is dignity in that.  I think it might be time for me to watch that movie again.  I cannot believe it has been eighty years since it was created.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My mom loaned me the DVD of the original Snow White and The Seven Dwarves.
Oh ya, we should watch it later.
Yes, and see how it looks compared to the ones they make today.
I wonder how long it would take to make a movie like that back then?
Oh, it must have taken a long to time to draw each frame of the movie.
Yes I heard that they kept bare frames of sequences to be used in other movies.
What do you mean?
Then they could paint over them for a different movie.
Oh really?
Yes, that is why a lot of the early Disney movies had the same dancing parts in them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the movie Hercules?
I think is very adventurous, I like all the Greek mythology and I think Disney did a good job adapting it.
Which is your least favorite character?
It would have to be Hades, he is very mean.
Which is one of your favorite scneces?
When Hercules is Training to become a hero.
Which other characters did you like from the movie?
I liked Pegasus because you saw him grew up with Hercules.
Which songs did you like from the movie?
My favorite one was from Zero to Hero.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I bought Zootopia on DVD yesterday.
Have you watched it yet?
Yeah, we watched it with the kids last night, they loved it.
Who is in it?
Jason Bateman, Ginnifer Goodwin, Shakira, and Idris Elba
oh, I love Idris Elba from Luther.
You haven't seen Zootopia yet?
No, I didn't get chance when it was in theaters, too busy as always.
Come over later if you like, we can watch it again and hang out for a while.
Great, I would love to see it. Be over about 8 if that's okay with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana?
I haven't. Isn't it a kid's movie?
It is, but I loved it too. There is some great  mythology in it.
Really? What?
Maui, the demigod.
He was really from Polynesian myth?
Yes. And all the symbols were great too.
Like what?
The fishhooks. I saw a lot of those in jewelry when we were in New Zealand.
That's interesting. I will have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good Disney movies lately?
Yeah I saw Pirates of the Caribbean.
I love Johnny Depp in that movie.
He is really a great pirate in that movie.
I also love Kiera Knightley in that movie.
She is also very good.
What did you think of Orlando Bloom's character?
He was also decent in it.
I havent seen the others but I would like to.
Same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to watch Wreck It Ralph tonight?
Yes! I was actually thinking about it the other day.
Yea? What about?
Oh how much I loved fix it Felix.
Yea Jack McBrayer was perfect for that role.
Oh I couldn't imagine anyone else playing him.
I loved how he had a crush on the girl Sargent.
Oh that was rediculous, I laughed really hard at the singing taffy too.
Yea me too. I really loved King Candy too. He was just rediculous even though he was so evil.
Yea I loved the twist with him at the end too. That was really unexpected.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Moana movie yet?
Yes, I did.
It was really awesome, right?
Yes, it was. I loved that it was not like a regular Disney movie where a prince and princess meets.
I know it was different.
I think it was awesome because the Moana movie was about family.
I loved how the movie really blended the culture right in.
Yeah, the songs were catchy.
I wish they would make a second Moana.
I hope so. It would be a hit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to watch Meet the Robinsons with me?
I heard that movie wasn't very good.
I enjoyed it. I'm about to watch it for the tenth time.
Doesn't  Adam West voice a character in that one?
Yeah, he's Uncle Art's voice actor. Tom Selleck is in it as well.
Tom Selleck? Now I've got to watch it.
It's a very underrated Disney film, if you ask me.
So, what's the plot? Time travel?
That's part of it. I don't want to spoil everything, though.
Alright, I'll check it out. I love computer animated movies, so this should be decent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the recent Beauty and the Beast movie or did you like Cinderella more?
I liked Cinderella more. I felt there was more heart.
I thought both were realy fun entertaining movies. Beauty and the Beast starred Emma Watson and had really good musical pieces.
I enjoyed them both but I felt Cinderella had more heart. I also really enjoyed Cate Blanchett's performance as the wicked step mother.
I'm a huge Lily James fan now because of Cinderella, but Emma Watson will always be my favorite.
I know you're a huge Emma fan, but Lily James gave a more sympathetic performance.
I think that has more to do with the character of Cinderella. She's just more sympathetic as a whole.
She did lose her parents and had to succumb to such wickedness from her step mother and step sisters.
Right, while Belle was kind of snobby being intellectually superior to her village. The CGI in Beauty and the Beast was definitely fantastic.
I thought both did a wonderful job. Don't forget about Fairy God Mother's transformations of the farm items into the carriage and all the magic she used!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Apparently the Cars franchise is continuing to do well at the box office.
Oh, yes. I heard the Cars 3 opening went really well.
I think I saw the first one. I remember Larry the Cable guy did one of the voices.
Yes. He was a tow truck called "Tow Mater".
And who was the main character in that movie?
The car was called Lightening McQueen.
His voice was also by a famous actor, wasn't it?
Yes. That was Owen Wilson, actually.
I wonder if the same characters are in this new movie.
Apparently Tow Mater, Lightning McQueen and other cars from the first two movies are in this one as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Moana was added to Netflix?
I didn't! I never got to see it in theaters.
I recommend it, it's pretty good.
I really liked Lilo and Stitch, is Moana kind of like that?
Sort of. They have similar locations.
I did really love the setting of Lilo and Stitch. It's not one you see often in movies.
Moana has a completely different story though.
I bet with Disney it's good no matter what.
Yeah, it's heartwarming like you'd expect.
I'll have to watch it later with my family.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe it is the 15th anniversary of Lilo and Stitch?
Are you serious, it can't have been that long ago...
I know I feel so old. Disney store is having 15th year anniversary products.
You're telling me, I swear it was just yesterday that came out. Anything cute up for sale?
Umm when is stitch not cute? He is totally still my favorite Disney character!
I know you love him. But I mean come on Pascal is pretty cute too and he has Maximus as a side kick.
Yeah but Stitch has Angel and like 625 other cousins to keep him company! And Pudge of course...
True true... I had totally forgotten they did more than one Stitch movie. And I mean who can argue about Pudge; I mean he controls the weather...
How could you forget that? There were three movies and a tv show; once again proving he is the best.
Agree to disagree. Although now I am hungry for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Disney movie growing up?
Oh gosh, I loved Bambi!
Oh, me too! I think Thumper was my favorite character.
Yes, he is super cute. What was your favorite Disney movie growing up?
Hm, I think it was the Little Mermaid. I really loved Ariel's voice.
Yes, her voice is pretty. I liked Flounder, her friend that's a fish.
I thought Ursula was really scary when I was a kid!
She was scary! Stealing Ariel's voice like that!
Speaking of underwater creatures and Disney movies, did you like Finding Nemo?
Yes, I love it, and I also like Finding Dory.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Rookie?
Was that the baseball movie?
Yeah and it starred Dennis Quaid.
I think it was too unbelievable.
Yeah it was a bit preposterous but arent most Disney films?
I loved the concept of an older guy getting a final crack at the bigs, but this was odd
I dont know how great of a job was done with the movie.
I think that we could say this film was a bust for the studio.
Quaid did a convincing job I will give you that.
Yes I agree but I was not into the whole make the big leagues after so long.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movie would you like to watch?
We can watch Beauty and The Beast.
I haven't seen that yet, was it good?
It was beautiful! I almost cried I was so moved by it.
Wow. Who is your favorite character?
Belle, for sure. Emma Watson really grabbed that role and made it her own.
I'd heard that she turned down La La Land, so she could do Beauty and the Beast.
I didn't know that.
What's funnier is Ryan Gosling was offered the Beast role, but turned it down for La La Land.
Oh wow, that's really something!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Mulan the other night.
That was pretty good.  When did it come out?
1998.
Who directed it?
Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft.
Who was the voice of Mulan?
Ming-Na Wen
Any famous actors' voices?
Eddie Murphy and BD Wong.
Nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Lady and the Tramp?
I used to love that movie when I was a kid!
Have you seen it recently?
Not in the past ten years. Why are you asking?
It's such a strange movie now that we're older.
How is it strange?
It's just a different movie. It just seems so outdated now.
In what way is it outdated?
I think Lady's owners are just so old fashioned it's silly.
I guess that makes sense considering when it was made.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Disney movie is your favorite, if you had to pick one?
Hummm, that's tough but I guess I'd say Frozen.
I didn't see it until Christmas last year, and I was surprised how much I liked it!
How about you, which is your favorite.
I absolutely loved Mulan.
Who was your favorite character.
A toss up between Mulan and the dragon - I loved Eddie Murphy's sassy attitude.
I liked the oriental setting of that one, too.  The garden at Mulan's house with the cherry blossoms was lovely.
Agree.  I would love to see what happened between Mulan afterwards.
I think they might be making another one but I'm not sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your least favorite Disney character.
That's easy, it's Malificent.
Ugh, what a horrible movie.
Yeah, what were they thinking?
Well they redeemed themselves with the new Beuty and the Beast.
I love the music in the origninal.
The new one has new songs.
Terrific, I'll have to watch it.
Disney has had some great villains.
And many great heroes/heroines!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Cinderella?
Yeah! I love that movie! I love the animation.
Yeah, Disney was ahead of the game for the time period.
I really loved when all of the birds helped her make the dress.
I did too. I loved the pumpkin that turned into a carraige.
Do you know who voiced the main character?
I think it was Ilene Woods.
I haven't heard the name before, but her voice is so familiar.
Yeah she has done a lot of Disney work.
She brought Cinderella to life, you can hear the emotion in her voice
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
My favorite of all time is The Little Mermaid.
I like that one, too! Sebastian is my favorite character!
I like him, too. And Scuttle.
Scuttle was a little annoying to me.
Really? I think he wasn't the brightest, but had the best intentions when helping Ariel.
King Triton was really strict, but he had to be with Ursula lurking around.
She was a creepy villain. When she grew to a huge size and stirred the sea, that was scary.
I agree. I liked the ending when King Triton let Ariel and Eric be together.
That was nice. I know there's a sequel the The Little Mermaid, but I haven't ever seen it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss the good old days of cartoons.
What kind do you mean.
Like the old epic Disney ones.
Such as?
Well, like Beauty and the Beast, and Peter Pan.
I loved the old Peter Pan cartoon!
It was so magical. I hardly ever see it on DVD anymore.
I loved the way the animation looked.
I loved the plot. The kids growing up but not realizing it.
Wendy and her brothers learning from Peter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the movie Gigantic?
No, what is it?
It's basically Disney's version of Jack and the Beanstalk.
Oh!  Well, at least that's original.  I've never seen that as a movie before.
Yeah, it comes out next year.
Depending on how it looks, I might actually see this one.
I wish Disney still did animated cartoons instead of that Pixar looking stuff.
I feel the same way.  They don't make em like they used to.
You'd think it would cost less to do it the older way.  I hear people all the time wishing they would go back to that.
I wish Disney had a channel on tv where it just showed the 90s cartoons they did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think you're overlooking Bambi.
That movie scared the crap out of me.
How? Because his mom was shot?
Yeah, that was really traumatic to watch as a kid.
I suppose. Although he did end up meeting his father, which makes some sense.
Sort of the natural progression of things right?
Yeah. Although I still don't know what to make of the frisky bunny friend.
Thumper? Yeah, again that was pretty mature content.
I suppose they figured kids wouldn't pick up on it.
Oh, but we totally did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know that they're remaking Mulan?
Yeah, I heard. Man I love the original Mulan!
It'll be great to have an actual Asian princess, bonus that it's not stereotypical.
Yes, I saw that the director finally decided to cast a Chinese actress in the principal role.
The movie won't have music though.
That's a travesty!
But hey, if Eddie Murphy is still playing Mushu, I'm happy.
That is one of the most iconic Disney roles ever!
That, plus the Genie in Aladdin!
Robin Williams, may he rest in peace.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i just bought the Frozen soundtrack.
Oh really I bet I have heard each song a bunch of times.
My favorite is probably In Summer with Olaf singing.
I just watched the movie again and Olaf still makes me laugh.
I hope he is in the second movie.
Ya I heard that is not coming out for a long time.
How did you feel about Cristoph and Anna?
I thought it was weird that she didn't know him that long but decided they were in love.
Ya I noticed that also. I thought it was strange after what had happened with Hans.
ya and he turned out to be a bad guy. Can you really trust Cristoph?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was complaining last week to my husband that we never do anything romantic together anymore.
I know a lot of married couples feel they get stuck in a rut of working and just being at home.
He suggested we go out to a movie for a date night.
Well, that sounds romantic! What did you go see?
The new Disney movie- Pirates of the Carribean- Dead Men Tell No Tales!
Well. that doesn't sound really romantic after all.
Of course, Johny Depp is still pretty cute, and I like his Jack Sparrow character that reminds me of Keith Richards, but no, it's not really romantic.
Unless if you act really scared during the scary parts, so you can snuggle up to your husband or hold his hand.
My husband's hands were full of popcorn and soda the whole time, so there was no hand holding.
Well, at least there was Johnny Depp to look at.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into the Star Wars movies?
You know, I've never seen any of them.
Whoa!  That is quite shocking.
I was going to try to get into them, but there are so many I don't know which ones to start with.
Yes, it can get confusing.
Do I start with timeline order or movie release order?
I would go with movie release order, that way you can see the movies the way they were made.
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.  Maybe I'll start watching them in time for the new one to be released.
I think you should definitely give them a chance.  They are classics!
I'm going to spend all weekend watching them, then.  It is settled!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know any movies that will help my kids understand mental health better?
Actually, yes. There are a bunch of Disney movies that tackle this theme, but the best is Inside Out.
Why is Inside Out such a good movie for mental health?
Well, it takes place both in the external world with interactions between real people and inside the heads of various customers.
So what's it like inside their heads?
Well, each of the main emotions is played by a character inside a person's head.
What emotions are there?
Disgust, joy, sadness, anger, and fear.
So like the negative emotions are bad and the positive one's are good in the movie?
No, not exactly, it's more nuanced than that. You need a proper balance of the positive and negative emotions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Aladdin movie was your favorite?
I loved the one with the forty thieves.
That was my favorite too.
How shocked were you that that guy was his father?
Honestly I had no idea that was coming, but afterwards I could see the resemblance.
They did look alike a little.
I was glued to the TV when they went to the hideout the first time.
The number of times I've said "Open Sesame" in my life is incalculable.
Same here, I sing the song all the time.
I keep making up my own words for it, it's so much fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the new "Beauty and Beast" remake?
I thought it was superb! Emma Watson did such a great job as Belle!
Yes, I was very happy with that casting choice. She had the look, the voice, everything!
I liked how they made her an inventor like her dad. That was a nice touch.
I thought so too. The movie was so similar to the original cartoon version, but all of the little differences only added to the story in my opinion.
Yeah, I was very happy with this version, and you know what a huge "Beauty and the Beast" fan I am!
Oh I know that. I'm glad you liked it. The music was my favorite part. So many great songs in that movie.
I think I hummed "Be Our Guest" for days after seeing the movie. Such a catchy tune and Ewan McGregor performed it flawlessly!
Agreed! There's nothing that man can't do. I could listen to his voice for hours!
Me too! I'm heading to the store now, I gotta buy the DVD...the songs are already stuck in my head, might as well watch it while i'm humming the lyrics!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your next favorite classic Disney movie?
Bambi was a good classic movie.
Bambi was good but it made me cry when his mother got shot.
Yeah, but Bambi learned a valuable lesson at the end.
What was the name of Bambi's best friend?
I think the best friend was a rabbit but not sure of the name.
Did Bambi had other forest friends besides the rabbit?
I think there was a chipmunk or a fox as a friend.
The fox was in another movie.  But I think Bambi had a chipmunk friend.
You're right, the fox was with a hound.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Christmas movie?
That's tough but I have to go with Mulpets Christmas Carol.
Oh good choice. Why?
We watch it every year on Christmas Eve. It's amazing anyway but that's why it's my favorite.
Michael Caine is in that right?
That's right. He plays Scrooge and he's the best Scrooge of all time.
Who do they get to play Marley and Marley.
Waldorf and Statler.
That's perfect!
Yea their song is great! I love those two grumpy guys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast film yet?
No, I haven't seen it yet. Have you?
Yeah I saw it in theaters a few weeks after it first came out.
What did you think?
I thought it was pretty good. Emma Watson was a good casting choice.
I always loved the original cartoon movie. Which did you think was better?
I think the cartoon was still better, but the new one is worth seeing.
I guess most remakes are never really as good as the original.
I agree, but it's still fun to see classic stories brought to life in new ways.
Good point. I think I'll rent the new Beauty and the Beast this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen the movie Brave?
are you talking about the movie where a red haired girl with a bow?
yea
Yea I've seen it, it was such an incredible movie, great music score too
I can't agree more, I listen the soundtrack on spotify all the time
Disney is really trying to give the troubled world a lot of good vibe
that's true, taking this movie for example, it's trying to promote social realization of female's importance in the world
yeah, that's the underlying tone. The magic with Disney movie is that, most of them are suitable for both adult and kids
yeah, now when I look back at some movies I watched, I can gain different insight as my life's knowledge build up
agreed
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Wall-E?
Yes! I love that movie. Why do you ask?
Because I think I'm getting a bit too large just like the people in that movie.
Haha. No you're not.
You don't think so?
No, I don't think anybody could be as lazy as those people in that movie.
Well I do like to sit in my chair a lot and watch Disney movies! Haha.
But that's okay because Disney movies are great.
Yeah I guess, and Wall-E is one of them.
Maybe you can do some jumping jacks the next time you watch it or something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
National Treasure was a good series for Disney
Yeah I thought Cage played a great character in it.
Yeah he was a code breaker in the film.
I forget what his name was
It was Ben Gates
Thats it! He was the ultimate thief if you will
Yeah he was looking for treasure in the movie
Isnt that why its called that
Yeah it was as old as the United States
Yes thats what the film centered around
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can;t get this song out of my head!
What song?
It's a small world after all.
Oh, my God. Now that song will be stuck in my head too!
Sorry.
That's Disney,,,or at least Disney World. Did that song every appear in a Disney movie?
I have no idea.
Me either! It had to be in some movie or something related to Disney, right?
I would think so. Maybe it was in "Winnie the Pooh?"
Wouldn't it be funny to hear Eor sing that song? It would be the most depressing version of that song ever!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Definitely Jungle Book.
The new one or the old cartoon?  I liked the new movie.
I liked the new movie too, but the old cartoon is my favorite.  I just loved all of the characters and the songs.
The songs are the best!  I love the monkey's song - that's got to be one of the best Disney songs of all time.
I even love just the background music too - it reminds me of Disneyland.
I thought that the new movie did a pretty good job too.  Some things were a little different but it was good.
I thought so too. I thought that the actor who played Mogli was really cute.
I heard that it was his first acting job and that's why he just seemed like a normal little boy.
Oh that's so cute. Of course I loved Baloo and Baghera too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Disney's Little Mermaid movie?
Actually I do, a lot.
What do you like best about it?
I thought Ariel was so cute.
She was! A typical Disney heroine.
I guess the movie marked Disney's successful return to animated feature films.
Yes I heard that.
So my favorite song was Under the Sea.
It was funny to see the crab sing it
Yep.  And the whole undersea world was gorgeous!
XXXXXXXXXXX
In the disney movie Cinderlla, do you know the names of her two step sisters?
I believe their names are Drucilla and Anastasia.
That's correct.  Do you know the names of the two main mice that helped Cinderella?
Jaq and Gus Gus.
Do you like the part when the fairy god mother came down and sang her song?
It was bibbity boppity boo, and the glass slippers are amazing.
The scene where she is racing away in her carriage against time and everything is turning back was exciting.  What about you?
I think the part when the duke is trying on the slipper to the sisters and Cinderella locked in her was terrifying.
What is your favorite part in the disney movie Lion King?
I liked the singing.  When simba and nala were singing just can't wait to be king
XXXXXXXXXXX
They keep killing it
Hm?
Well the new movies they are making are top quality
Are they
Especially the plot in them
Eh
What
I think the plot in the older movies was more touching
How so
Nothing comes close to Simbas dad dying or the the crazy kid in toy story
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
No. I haven't been able to keep up with them.
Well another one is coming out in December 2017!
Wow. Which episode will this one be.
It's the eighth.
Oh okay. I need to re-watch them all before December!
Yes you do! This one is being Directed and Written by Rian Johnson.
I have never heard of him. Has he directed any of the previous ones?
I don't think so. But I'm not sure.
Well Disney always does a great job with them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the best Disney Villain?
Scar all the way.
No doubt!
I know, he killed and betrayed his own brother.
And made a deal with those hyenas.
Jeremy Irons was perfect in that role.
Tell me about it.  You know who else was awesome?
Captain Hook.
I was just about to say that.
Great minds think alike.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the most unusual place you've ever seen a Disney movie?
For me, that's easy. At DisneyWorld.
What movie did you see at DisneyWorld?
"The Lion King."
Was this in the park, or what?
No, at the hotel. We were staying in a Disney hotel and they had a small cafeteria area and there was a big screen TV in there and they were just starting Lion King when I got there. Sat there and watched the whole thing.
That's kind of cool.
Yes, it was. It's one of my better stories about Disney movies.
Got another one?
Honestly, no. Guess it's my only story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Disney movies?
Yea I love Disney!
What's your favorite movie that they've released.
Wow, that's an extremely difficult question.
Haha, sorry, I was just curious.
I'd probably have to say Toy Story. Woody and Buzz were awesome lead characters
They were so lovable!
What about you, what was your favorite Disney movie?
Definitely Mighty Ducks. I'm a big sports person so that was my favorite growing up.
Yea that's a good choice too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched the Lion King the other day.  But I still don't see how it is Hamlet.
Well, the uncle kills the king and takes his place.
I get that.  But nothing else about it is the same.
That's true.  Like Simba ran away after his dad was killed, not before.
And most of the characters were still alive in the end.
Timon and Pumbaa were like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, right?
I think so.  But they did not try to help Simba get executed.
And Simba didn't have them killed either.
In short, I wish people would say that The Lion King was influenced by Hamlet, not that it's the exact same story.
But the movie is still good.  And Jonathan Taylor Thomas had the perfect voice for child Simba.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just heard that a new Descendants thing is coming out.
Me too, I didn't really see too much of the first one, but parts of it sounded pretty good.
It just doesn't make sense to me. How are the villains still alive? Who did they have children with? Why have them at all if they're going to treat them like that?
Look at House of Mouse, that's just one giant crossover that throws all the rules out of the window. Disney just does what it wants.
I know, it's like canon continuity doesn't exist. It's kind of annoying.
Sometimes, you just have to go with it. It's just a show.
It's not just a show, it's not just even one show! How is everything supposed to make sense if they can't keep the timeline straight?
Relax, will ya? Let's just ignore it. Think of it as an alternate reality. A reality where children of heroes and villains somehow go to the same school and sing a lot.
It's still ridiculous.
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Disney movie as a child?
The Fox and the Hound. Have you seen it?
No, I'm not familiar with that one. What's it about?
Well, it's a story of friendship between a fox and hound, but it has a very sad aspect to it.
How so? What is sad about it?
The fox and the hound become friends when they are young, but when the hound grows up they are split apart.
Oh, that sounds fairly typical of Disney movies from that time period.
Yes, that is true. Lion King, Bambi, and all of the other movies at that time had some sad parts in the plots.
I can't count how many times I watched Lion King, but I always looked away during the scene where Mufasa died.
I can understand that. Tough for a kid to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that in Frozen there's an Easter egg where you can see Rapunzel and Flynn?
Really? When?
During Elsa's coronation. You only see them for a moment and it's mostly the back of their heads.
That's so crazy. I wonder how they're related.
Yea, there's other Easter eggs and theories about Frozen too.
Like what?
Well one of the theories is that Elsa and Anna's parents were shipwrecked and basically became part of the Tarzan storyline.
Like they were Tarzan's parents?
Yeap.
That's so crazy! But I guess it would make sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it true what they say about the real Snow White? You know the real one which the Disney movie was based on?
Yes, it true she drifted. She’s really the original cocaine princess.
Well is it true about the dwarfs?
Yes, Snow White was their pimp. She gave drugs to Dopey and in turn he sold his body.
Clutch the pearls! How are the other dwarfs in the movie?
I don’t like to gossip but Bashful dwarf in the movie is actually Snow White’s head whore.
Be still my foolish heart! Not Bashful, he was my favorite dwarf. So Snow White the movie is really about coke heads?
That my observation  and just between me and you, Sneazey got his nickname from all the coke he snorts.
Heavens to Betsy! Damn that Snowed White. Is there more?
Just that the Enchanted Forest is really code for crack house and how much do you really know about the Disney movie Little Red Riding Hood?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really want to visit Disney World.
But haven't you been to Disneyland a lot? What's so different?
Disneyworld has a Lilo and Stich rides.
That's one of my favorite movies!
Mine as well. It never fails to cheer me up and make me cry.
It's an emotional rollercoaster!
But well worth the ride.
I agree. The message of ohana really resonates with me.
Yeah, that's the part that makes me cry--it's so meaningful.
Isn't it? I love the family relationships in that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Beauty and the Best with Emma Watson yet?
I want to but I still waiting for it to come to red box to rent.
Me too.
The trailer of the movie is good and I wonder how much of the original they keep in the movie.
As far as I know they suppose to keep about the same except it's going to be perform by real person.
I heard the new theme song in the music video and it is beautiful.
I heard there are two different version by different singers.
I'm not sure which one I heard.
I am so ready for it to come to Red Box to rent.
If you can't wait, you can always buy the DVD so I could borrow it from you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the movie Peter Pan?
The animated one from Disney? Yes!
I wanted to be Wendy Darling so much growing up.
Her character is so cute and posh.
She's also so fearless and firm in her beliefs.
I related to her a lot growing up too, feeling a lot more adult than you really were.
Oh yes, she did become the Lost Boy's mother after all.
Haha, well not long after Wendy's mother became most of their mothers.
Yes that is true.
It's a shame Peter didn't come with the rest of the Lost Boys to stay with Wendy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Aladdin?
Of course I have! It is my favorite!
Who is your favorite character?
I like Jasmine. She is a role model for young women.
I like the Genie. I am glad he was finally set free.
It was the least Aladdin could do for his pal.
What was the monkey's name?
Abu! He was a little thief!
He was a cute monkey. I want a monkey.
You are not Aladdin!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My kids loved Disney movies when they were growing up. And I'd sit down and watch them over and over with them.
Mine too. I would think that I would just sit down for a second and then an hour later I was still watching.
Yes. Especially Lion King or Beauty and the Beast.
I loved those. I also loved the really old ones like Lady and the Tramp.
We still have VHS tapes of those movies.
We do too. I don't know what to do with them.
Yes. I can't get rid of them for some reason and nobody watches VHS anymore.
The Disney VHS are the only ones I have kept.
We have some DVDs too but most of ours are VHS.
We'll have to pass them on to our kids and let them worry about getting rid of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that they're doing a live-action remake of The Lion King?
Wow! I wonder how they're going to manage that?
Well, they did The Jungle Book with CGI, so I guess they'll use the same techniques.
My kids really love that movie, although the part where Simba's dad dies is pretty sad.
I know! Never mind my kids, that had me crying in the theater.
Still, I think that's part of the movie's enduring appeal.
Yeah, I think it helps kids deal with the idea that death is part of the circle of life.
It's also a hilarious movie, though. I hope the remake keeps the humor!
And the romance between Simba and Nala. It's so sweet!
I'm looking forward to seeing this one when it comes out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
A new Cars movie is coming out?
I heard. It has been a while since the last one.
Yes. My kids are older now but I think they will still want to see it.
Really? I though it was for younger kids?
That may have been the intention, but we seem to enjoy it as a family.
I guess I need to revisit them and take a second look.
The people they chose to do the voices were the best. They really compliment each other. Mater was hilarious.
He was the tow truck, right? He was funny.
Not sure what kid of story line they will go with.
Hope they can pull it off. Sometimes sequels are not the best!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the latest Pirates of the Carribean movie?
Not yet but my family and I are this weekend.
I think you will like it.
Oh, how so?
Jack Sparrow does a great job in this one.
He did a great job in all of them so far.
I agree, but this he gave his best performance yet.
Oh wow, I can't wait to see it.
I bet, it is #1 at the box office currently.
I hope they make more of these movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Mulun?
The Disney movie?
Yes, that one.
No, but I really need to. I am obsessed with Donny Osmond and he has a role in it.
Plus he sings.
Oh, that voice of his!
Didn't people used to tease you about your Donny obsession?
Yes, and I couldn't care less! He is so talented  and cute.
Let's watch it together over the weekend.
It's a date!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I really liked Aladdin.
Oh yeah!  Robin Williams as the Genie; he stole the show for sure.
Yeah.  What about you?
I really like The Lion King.
Another fantastic Disney classic!  I like that movie too.
There's just something about them back then that made them so much more.. relevant?  I don't know.
They were so impressive and grand--it took years to make a movie like that, and now it takes, what, months?
Maybe that's it. I don't know.
There's just something about old Disney movies that can't be recaptured.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just re-watched The Lion King last night.
Oh, was it the original or one of the sequels?
The original. It just brings me back to my childhood.
Yeah, I have fond memories of that movie too.
Do you know they have a musical on Broadway for the Lion King?
No, but that sounds fantastic! Would you want to go see it?
Absolutely. It would be a big trip to get to New York City, but it would be a highlight.
I wonder how they represent all the characters like Simba since the characters are all animals.
Good question. They must do a great job. I hear it has been on Broadway for a while.
Well, let's plan to go!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever see that old Disney movie, The Black Hole?
Seen it? I haven't even heard of it.
It's OK, kind of cheesy and very un-Disney like.
Oh yeah, who;s in it?
It starred Maximilian Schell and Anthony Perkins, that dude from Psycho. It's a space movie, and it has couple of corny robots.
Really?
Yeah, but it isn't all that bad
Are there any women in it?
Yeah, Yvette Mimieux, she was in a  lot of those old SF movies.
OK, Sounds good. I think I will check it out,
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was watching Cars the other night, my favorite is still Sally.
I'm more partial to Doc. That scene where he puts on his old race tires and is my favorite.
That's when Lightening realizes that he was in the presence of greatness.
It was. The colors in that part of the film were amazing, and the blue on Doc, well...it reminded me so much of Paul Newman's eyes.
I just loved seeing Doc on the stand, at the race.
My favorite part in that scene was when Mator finally said goodbye.
Red, Lizzy and Sally gathered around that old black and white tv was adorable. I think they stayed behind for Lizzie.
I do too. She is a great character, I liked when she slapped that bumper sticker on Lightening.
Me too! And, when she said goodnight to Stanley.
That was sad and sweet at the same time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
whats your favorite pixar
the incredibles
it had a good story and felt like you could enjoy at any age
what was the story even
they were old superheroes and wanted to live normally
it wasn't that unique
they did it very well though.
do we know which Pixar got the best rating
I think its toy story 2
lets check it out
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which did you like better, the live action Jungle Book or the original animated version?
I would say the original animated version, but I did enjoy the live action as well.
I thought Bill Murray was hysterial as Baloo.
Agree, he was the perfect choice.  All the real animals were amazing.
I read that the boy who played Mowgli was never actually with the animals.
It mush have been tricky for him to film his scenes, but it makes sense.  It would have been pretty dangerous.
I thought it was neat how the live action movie gave more information about how it was the Mowgli ended up in the jungle.
Yes, that wasn't something I had expected.
I wonder if Disney will make more of the animated classics into live action films.
There are quite a few that would be good candidates, I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the lion king?
Yes I thought it was great
The story of Simba was a sad one.
I thought when he discovered his father
That it was the greatest thing ever?
Well great in that it really pulled at your heart.
Yeah I agree with that.
I just think it was a great animated acting scene.
It was one of their bests.
I like that they rarely do sequels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Zootopia is still my favorite Disney film.
I thought that was a great movie too!
Have you seen the Behind the Scenes of it?
No, I haven't.
Well, the original story of the movie was supposed to be much darker. There were government regulated collars for predators so they are oppressed from their natural instincts.
Oh wow... That sounds really interesting. I wonder why they changed it.
I'm not too sure but it was definately a late change. They scrapped it after finishing 2/3 of production!
Woah! That is crazy!
Honestly, I'd like them to bring the idea back.
Same! Maybe they were struggling with how to make the setting work with the characters, but I know Disney can do it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Little Mermaid has to be my favorite of all time
Really? I'm not really into the talking animals like Sebastian and Flounder.
I love speaking Animals.  The imagination behind Ursula, and the curse of her stealing Ariel's voice is so fun to engage in.
It definitely has to much imagination for me, but I'm sucker for Prince Eric and some romance plot.
That's understandable.  You know I've always wanted a dog like Max, Eric's dog.
Well, you sure you didn't want a fish with how much you love this little sea story?
I guess I wanted a bond like Eric had with Max.  Just like when he saved him from that burning ship.
That's when he encountered Ariel right? Those love stories get me I guess.
See, I knew you liked some part of the Little Mermaid.
I guess I do, but I think I relate more to Sebastian or Triton though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you feel bad for those poor unfortunate souls from the little mermaid?
A little, but I still like Ursula.
Why do you like the villain?
Well maybe like isn't the right word for it.
Well it's a simple question, do you like her or not?
Well it's more that I feel sorry for her.
How do you feel sorry for her, she tried to steal Ariel's voice?
Well she didn't think her voice was good enough.
What does that have to do with anything?
Well I loved her song, it was incredible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the whole if you lie your nose will grow thing in Pinocchio.
Why is that?
I use that line on my kids all the time.
Oh yeah?
Yeah. I tell them if they lie their nose will grow and Mr. Geppetto will get real sad.
Well, they're young still. I'm not sure that line will work for long.
Probably not, but I'm going to use it while I can.
Hey if it works, why stop?
My thoughts exactly.
You should tell them about the Island of Misfit Toys too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last movie you saw in theaters?
The Princess and the Frog.
I love that movie. Oh man that really took me back to being a little girl.
Me too! There were like 20 of us moms there and we all felt like 7 year old girls wanting to be princesses.
Oh me too. Tiana was so pretty!
Yea and she could bake too. Those Beignets look amazing.
Oh I just wanted to lick the screen.
Oh me too. I loved Ray in the film.
Oh the firefly. He was so cute.
Yea him being in love with that star was adorable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Monsters University finally!
It took you long enough!
I think it was even better than the first one! Mike as a child was so cute!
Oh I know, he was the cutest little monster. I loved seeing younger Sulley too!
His hair was so great in it!
Yes, and Randall with his glasses!
I did like all the games, but I have to say I really did miss Boo.
Boo was a great character and it was sad not to see her!
I think it was interesting they went to the past for the sequel instead of the future.
Yeah, but this prequel gave us such new information!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Disney princess?
Oh, easy!  My favorite princess for sure is Pocahontas.
Really?  Why Pocahontas?
Obviously because she's one of the first that did not act like a complete "damsel in distress".
She still ends up with the leading male at the end of the movie, just like all the other Disney princesses.
Right, but she watches out for him and shows her father she's willing to sacrifice her life to save his when he gets captured.
True.  I think Elsa is my favorite though because she truly does not rely on anyone but herself.
Pocahontas doesn't really rely on anyone but herself either!
She's got Meeko and Flit who are her sidekicks.
Well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the most iconic Disney movie from your childhood?
For me it was the Little Mermaid, hands down.
Yes! Such a good Disney movie!
I remember I wanted to be Ariel. Like the red hair, the seashell bra, the fins, everything.
Who wouldn't? Prince Eric was totally my first crush.
I know! I was in love with him.
And I remember thinking Scuttle and Sebastian were hilarious.
Yea, Scuttle and all of his false knowledge about human objects.
So funny! And Ariel totally believes whatever he says.
Such a good movie. I need to buy it on DVD for when I have kids.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe they finally made a sequel to Finding Nemo!
They did? What's it about?
It's called Finding Dory. So they're gonna focus on her.
Was that the blue fish in the movie?
Yeah, the one who keeps forgetting things.
Do you remember who did her voice?
I think she was voiced by Ellen Degeneres.
Ellen is so funny. Do you think it'll be good?
Yeah, I'm really excited about it. I loved the first one.
Me too, as do my kids!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So is it just Disney animation you like then?
Pretty much.
Like Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid?
Yes, I think the music is always great too
I only know a few songs, like Be Our Guest
You like Reggae so you would love the Little Mermaid soundtrack
I'll check it out. Do you like the new movies like Frozen?
Not as much. The songs are good but too much hype
Yes I see Frozen stuff everywhere
Yes and they are not as good as the classics to me anyway
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm really psyched for the next Star Wars film.
Yeah, Force Awakens was pretty cool. I was afraid when Disney bought it from Lucas.
Why? You didn't think they would put Donald Duck in it or something?
Well, that's just silly. I was afraid they wouldn't allow the dark story lines.
They tossed a lot of the EU. But What happened to Han and Leia was pretty damned dark.
So was Rogue One.
I really loved that they fitted it into A New Hope so well.
My dad was a Disney exec, he said they never neglect characters or series with a following.
Disney seems to be listening to George Lucas, without letting him screw up things.
Yeah, like those prequels. God.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your impression of the Toy Story series?
Oh, they were fun and entertaining to watch.
I watched two of them, haven't caught up with the latest.
You should watch it before the latest releases.
What? Another is in the pipeline?
Yes, set for release some time around July 2018
Well I have time to catch up then. What will be the story in the latest movie?
Heard there might be a love story between Woody and Bo Beep.
Really? I love all the characters of Toy Story.
They sure give a new meaning to toys, don't they?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw "Brave" on Netflix.
Yeah? It's an interesting movie. Did you like it?
It's ok, it's like a different take on the classic "Princess" storyline.
I thought it was interesting how her mother turned into a bear.
Right?! That was weird. But why was I so ready for her to ride her "Mother Bear" into battle.
I thought the same thing, or at least use the mother in a fight.
You know the princess, Merida, was played by Kelly Macdonald.
Cool, I didn't know that.
Yeah, she did a good job, you could really hear the emotion in her voice.
I think all of the voice actors did a good job.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you see the new Disney movie Cars 3?
No, I haven't been able to watch it yet. Have you?
Yeah. You really should watch it. It released this week and is amazing.
I definitely will. Which actors make up the cast of the movie?
The cast includes Owen Wilson, Nathan Fillion and Kerry Washington among the major cast.
Oh wow! Cars 3 seems to have a really star studded cast.
Indeed it does. The major part of Cars 3 I loved was the soundtrack. I cannot get it out of my head.
That sounds great. Disney really seemed to have made many movies with brilliant music this year.
I definitely agree. So when will you watch Cars 3?
I think I will surely book my ticket for this week.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love watching Disney movies, do you?
Oh yes, one of my favorites is The Little Mermaid.
I enjoyed that too as a kid.
Another one that I love is Beauty and the Beast.
Me too! Have you seen the new version of that?
No unfortunately but I have been meaning too.
You need to watch it, I think it has Emma Watson in it. It's excellent.
I did hear good things about it!
Maybe one day they'll remake the Little Mermaid.
That would be pretty cool. I would enjoy that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Disney's movie The Princess Diaries?
The Princess Diaries?? the one released back in 2001?
Yes thats the one I am talking about. It was such an interesting movie.
Yes i remember that movie, it was about a teen girl who unexpectedly happen to be princess of a small European State.
Right, she was really shy and clumsy girl, then she discovers she is a princess, that was really a twist of faith!
Anne Hathaway acted really awesome as Mia Thermopolis. She was making me laugh quite a good!
Thermopolis!! even that name is funny right. Sounds like its a name of an instrument in a chemistry lab!
Actually her name is Amelia Mignonette Grimaldi Thermopolis Renaldi, Mia Thermopolis is her short name.
Yeah but longer is much better for a princess, longer name sounds more royal.
That is true but a name that longer is not quite handy if someone is addressing her, thats why they call her Mia.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tell me ! Are you team frozen ?
Like the movie ?
Yes the movie , what else ?!
I mean I thought the movie was cute, but so overhyped.
I personally loved it ! The songs were so cute.
I will give you that, they were.
Love is an open door and let it go are my favorites.
I think mine would be do you wanna build a snowman?
That's the best song!
Olaf is too cute !
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read about Gigantic which has a fantasy storyline.
What is it about and what is it based on?
The idea seems to be from Jack and the Beanstalk and has Jack as the main character.
What happens in the movie?
Well, he meets giants in the sky as the name suggests.
Sounds like a fun premise. What else?
He meets a 11 year-old girl who is around 60 ft tall!
Do they become friends?
it seems so, must be difficult for Jack to be around all those really tall people.
It would be scary, I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have ever seen any of the Star Wars movies?
Are you kidding me?! I am a huge fan of a Star Wars saga.
Did you know that a new movie Star Wars: The Last Jedi is coming out soon? I am not going to miss it.
Really? Nice! What is the planned release date?
December 2017, according to Disney. Remember that character Jyn Erso from the "The Rouge One" episode? She is going to finally start her Jedi training.
Wow, that is actually how the last episode ended. I am pretty sure this one will be awesome just like the other ones.
Yeah, I really liked how they introduced new story lines and characters into the saga.
It really amazes me how they can keep it coming for so many years. Although I am a grown man, I really enjoyed those animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Did you watch those?
Yes, sure. We watched it together with my son. I hope there will be more episodes coming in the future and it will never end...
Agree, I would not want it to end ever! Such a fascinating story!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Isn't their supposed to be an Incredibles sequel?
I've heard that for years and years and nothing.
It came out a while ago, I think.
2004 to be exact.  I was still in college when it was released.
I wish the dad were my insurance agent.
If it meant I could get what I wanted from the company, sure.
I still don't really understand how the kid got rich.
And bought his own island?  Yeah, a bit farfetched.
I would never wear tight clothes like that.
I'm glad you don't!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey I brought back your copy of The Lion King.
Did you like it?
Yes! You didn't tell me how sad it was.
Oh yea the Mufassa scene. I didn't want to spoil it.
Well I appreciate you. It spoiling it. Timon and Pumba were rediculous.
Yea they remind me of your brothers.
Yea me too! Especially with how gross they are. The songs were incredible.
Well it's Disney of course they were.
How many times have you seen it?
Probably a dozen times since it first came out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see they are making a new Pete's Dragon?
I believe it is out already.
I wonder how Pete looks in this new one.
Definitely not the goofy green dragon like the original.
I loved the songs from that movie.
Me too, it was such a nice story.
Oh and how Pete cooked those apples with his fire, I used to laugh at that part all the time.
I remember that.
I should look online to see if I can buy a copy of the original.
You should look to get the new one too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Toy Story?
It was different
It was creative
I thought Buzz was pretty dumb
Yeah
It's kind of like he just got activated after leaving his box
You would think he would have been conscious while on the shelf and realize that he was not a space man
Toys in the store were alive
It was the first animated film I saw
I think it was the first animated film made
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the remake of Beauty and the Beast
Not yet
Me either
Ive been really wanting to though
Uea, im nervous ill hate it
Because you liked the original so much?
Yes exactly
I hope it will be good
Hopefully
You never know when they remake movies
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey i saw a deer as i was driving today, and it reminded me of something
oh thats cool, and what is that?
the deer from the movie bambi
is that the disney movie you are referring to?
yes, the deer looked young just how bambi did in the movie
oh wow, did you see his little rabbit friend too?
now you are taking it too far, i just saw a deer that looked like bambi
im only kidding with you, that was a good movie though
yeah it was i would like to watch it again
same here, let me know when you do so and ill come too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite disney princess?
I don't know, I tend to like the villains.
Really?
Definitely, they feel more dynamic for some reason.
For example?
Scar from Lion King.
I love Scar!
I do too, he deserves his own movie.
I know, right!
I want to know what happened to him to make him how he was by the start of Lion King.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay if you had to pick a side, whose side would you pick, Buzz or Woody?
Are you talking about the characters from Toy Story?
Yes now pick!
The whole point of the movie is to not pick sides but to be friends and work together.
I know that, this is only hypothetical. I would pick Buzz.
If I had to choose, I would pick Woody since he is such good friends with all the other toys like Rex, Slinky Dog, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head.
Yeah but Buzz can fly!
Or is it "falling with style"?
Very funny! I love that movie. Its such a great idea and story.
You have to give it up to Disney and Pixar. They make such good movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Frozen is this generation's Lion King.
Do you think so? They're such different movies.
I know, but I think they just both took off in the same way.
Oh, do you think they both just became really popular?
Yeah, and they also both have songs everyone knows.
The "Let It Go" song kind of annoys me sometimes.
I agree. I liked it at first, but now I can't stand it.
The songs from The Lion King didn't annoy me like that.
Maybe that had something to do with us being kids with The Lion King came out though.
Maybe you're right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember that Disney movie we went to see a couple years ago, Inside Out, about the little girl with the five emotions?
Yeah, that was a pretty good movie.
I just read a news article about how Disney is being sued for stealing someone elses idea for the movie.
It's hard to believe Disney, which makes wholesome products, would be so unethical.
I know, but this woman is a child development specialist, and she supposedly had several meetings with the Disney people about her idea, and then they stole it.
Is it possible her idea was just something similar, but not like the movie they made?
No, her idea was called Moodsters, and was 5 characters who were different emotions and each a different color.
Oh, that is a lot like the movie, where the girl was dealing with 5 different emotions who appeared as characters in different colors.
A couple months ago, a screenwriter filed a lawsuit saying Disney copied from his work when they made the Zootopia movie.
What's up with that? Disney has plenty of money, why don't they just pay these people if they want to use their ideas?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm tired today because I was up late last night looking online for ideas on what to buy some of the people on my Christmas shopping list.
I pretty much know what I'm getting everyone. Who were you shopping for?
One of the hard ones is my seven year old niece. She's the only niece I have, so I like to get her something special.
I have a ten year old niece, and I already ordered some great stuff for her on Amazon.
What did you buy?
She loves that Disney movie Finding Nemo, so I ordered this cute Finding Nemo blanket, and some stuffed animals, Nemo and Dory.
Oh. That's a great idea. My niece loves the Disney movie Frozen, I bet I could find some Frozen stuff like that.
You could probably find Frozen clothing and costumes too, she would probably like a Frozen nightgown or something.
That's an awesome idea! You just made my shopping a lot easier.
No problem, you know how I LOVE online shopping!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the BFG?
The big friendly guy?
haha, yes
oh, now I remember, sophie, the orphan that had quite an amazing adventure in the realm of giant
yes indeed, she encountered the giant and helped him from being bullied by those savages
yeah, the brave little girl led the giant to see the queen in the palace, and they tried to serve the giant
oh that scene was hilarious, the giant brought over his own green potion that has bubbles going from top to bottom, remember?
yeah, it made them all fart quite dramatically
it's so funny
I could see myself seeing that movie again
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think ever happened to Sid?
You mean the bad kid from 'Toy Story?'
Yea.  After the toys revealed themselves to him.
I'm assuming that he either became a better person, or he ended up losing his mind.
I think both those options are likely.  I mean as a kid, how would you react to seeing toys start talking?
Especially in a scary fashion like that.
I don't get how the Woody and the other toys got away with that.
I agree.  I would assume there's some cosmic law or consequence for revealing themselves to humans.
And if not, how would the toys know, or feel inclined to pretend to be inanimate every time Andy enters a room.
I know it's a children's movie so the questions will never be answered.  But it's fun to think about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your dream house like?
Probably the beasts castle in a Beauty and the Beast.
Oh good choice. Would you want all the firniture to be alive?
Absolutely. I would want them to perform "Be Our Guest" every night before dinner.
Haha, wouldn't you get sick of it?
I didn't as a little girl and I don't think I would now.
Valid point.
Plus the library is amazing. I would spend most of my time in there.
Wow you really are just like Belle.
That is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Cars 3 is out already?
I didn't even know they were making a third.
Yea, supposedly Lightning McQueen is old news and he's struggling to keep up with the newer younger racers.
Sounds like a few people I know!
I saw the trailer for it last time I went to the movies. It looks pretty good!
Is Mater going to be in this one too? I love Larry the Cable Guy!
Of course! You can't have Cars without Mater!
I'll have to go home and watch the trailer.
Or, better yet, let's go to the movies and watch it.
Sounds good! I'm free tonight around 8. See you then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that movie Big Hero 6?
Yeah, it was actually really good.
I agree, I didn't expect it to be good from the trailer.
I didn't expect it to be good either, I thought it was over-hyped.
Yeah same here, but it actually made me sad!
I know right, when the robot sacrificed himself for the boy...so sad.
Yeah, but in the end, the robot was saved by the memory card thing.
Yeah, uugh I hate how his brother died in the beginning.
I thought it was kind of funny...
Your sick!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Mulan?
Yes when I was younger. I liked it.
I loved that movie. I loved that she was so empowered.
I think it has a joan of ark theme to it.
How so? Didn't joan her the voice of god?
She did. I think they are similar in a female dresses up as a male to be in a combat situation.
That is very true. Never thought of that.
I wonder if Disney drew directly on joan for this Mulan character plot.
It was actually based on the legend of Hua Mulan.
I never realized that. Pretty neat. Maybe lots of women had to conceal themselves to have more rights back in the day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch 'Aladdin' as a kid?
I probably watched it way too many times.  Such a fun movie.
Can you believe it's been nearly 25 years since it was released in 1992?
I can't believe it is that old.  Especially because of how timeless it is.
'A Whole New World' is still one of the best Disney songs.
I agree, which is saying a lot because there were so many other great songs in that movie.
The character that always stands out in my mind is Robin Williams' Genie.
Genie was such a cool character.  Robin made that character his.
Exactly.  No one else could ever play a better genie.
I absolutely agree.  And who knew he could sing?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?
No, but I want to! Is it good?
Oh, it's just great. I loved it.
Does it follow the animated one's storyline?
Yes, pretty close.
I think I'd be upset if they changed it too much.
No, they didn't mess with the story. Some things were added, but they fit in very well.
Like what?
Well, we get to learn what happened to Bell's mother, for example. How she died.
That sounds intriguing. I can't wait to see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that James and The Giant Peach is a Disney movie?
Really? I never even knew that.
Yeah I always thought Tim Burton had directed it but nope Henry Selick did.
It does remind me of his artwork though.
I liked the book a lot and Disney did a great adaptation of it for sure.
My favorite character is the centipede.
He is funny. Richard Dreyfuss was a great choice for him.
Susan Sarandon was a good choice for Miss Spider as well.
I liked though at the end that James got a good family.
It was an odd ending but a happy one for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the disney movie Cinderella was released in 1950?
I knew it was a while ago but not that long.
It is classic! Every little girl still watches it today.
You are  right. Who was your favorite character.
I liked Gus the little fat mouse.
Yea the mice were funny.
I loved the cute little birds that helped the mice sew the dress.
Me too.
Cinderella was beautful even if she was a cartoon.
Yes she was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about that "Coco" trailer?
Is that coming out this year?
Yeah, it's expected to be released on November 22nd.
Hmm... I don't have any strong opinions of it so far since it's so early.
That is true. But the cultural part of it is interesting.
Oh for sure. I think Disney is doing a good job on touching different perspectives.
I agree. It could be just me, but sometimes I feel like Disney movies correlate to specific politics.
Haha, really? What makes you think that?
Again, it could just be a coincidence but you know how Trump feels about Mexicans.
Ah, I can see why you feel this way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen the movie Hook with Robin Williams?
Yes, I did not care for it. I would like  to know peter pan as the kid who never grew up
same here, I did not like how useless they made him as an adult
I thought it was neat that the grandmother was Wendy though
I know, it was sad to see how she had grown up and gotten old
I always wondered if I would have stayed in Neverland so I could stay young
do you think we may think more about that as ADULTS?
YES, PROBABLY because we would like to be young again
this movie did show a human side to captain hook though which was nice in some ways
it was , I liked the part where the boys imagined all of that food, I wish I could do that !
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Frozen?
To be honest, I thought it was average.
Me too! A lot of my friends who have children are raving about it.
Yeah, it was advertised as "the first movie that really features female empowerment" and I didn't like that.
I agree! Mulan was years before Frozen and she was the most empowered Disney character ever!
That is exactly how I feel! I don't like how the newer movies are overshadowing the classics.
I completely agree with you, even though the songs from Frozen are pretty catchy.
Oh I know, I went to Kareoke last week with my friends and at least 3 groups sang "Let it Go," and by the end of the night it was stuck in my head!
My sister's daughter has been wearing her Elsa costume for a week straight, so I guess it is pretty popular with the kids!
I'm gonna stick to watching the classics, Mulan for life!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what bugs me?
What's that?
Whenever you see Rapunzel, why does she have long hair again?
What do you mean?
So Flynn Rider cut her hair off in the movie, but it's always long in the cartoons again.
Ah, I see.  Guess it's better marketing.
But it totally breaks the canon of the series.
Do you really think kids care about that stuff?
My five year old noticed it!
Mine was too busy dancing around to the music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get around to seeing Moana?
Yes. It is one of my favorite movies now.
Me too. I love how family friendly it is.
I agree. I enjoy just as much as my 3 year old niece.
My younger cousins love the song that the crab sings.
Oh, you're talking about the song "Shiny". That song was really funny.
On the topic of songs, I was surprised that Dwayne Johnson sang for his role.
Yeah, I didn't expect that from him, and his character was really funny too.
I agree. The chemistry between Moana and Maui was great.
I wonder if they're planning on making a sequel, so we can see what the characters are up to now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh my goodness do you remember pinnochio
Do I ever. The wooden boy
A classic for sure
Gippeto really loved his wooden doll
Yeah I know. All pinnochio wanted to do was become a real boy
Him meet I g the bad guys didn't help him much
Jimminy cricket was one of my favorites
Yeah. He was pinnochio voice of reason
In the end when he became a real boy I think I cried
Well he finally got what he wanted
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay so classic Disney movies. How about Cinderella?
That was a good one. The music was catchy.
It was. Although it was a bit of a girl movie.
No kidding. A girl is forbidden from going out by her step mom - total teen drama, right?
My thoughts exactly. The step mom probably wasn't even that evil.
No, that was just Cinderella's take on it.
And there's no way Prince Charming was that charming.
I wouldn't think so. Most prices are sort of spoilt and ill adjusted.
Well, it's definitely a young woman's fantasy. Right down to the Fairy God Mother.
Who's skilled at producing ball gowns! For sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You saw the live action Beauty and the Beast, right?
Yeah, I saw it a couple of weeks ago. It was really good. Why?
I was wondering how you felt it held up to the original cartoon version?
I thought it was a perfect copy of the original! The songs were so beautiful and the characters were all cast perfectly.
Really? It was that good?
Oh, absolutely. Beauty and the Beast was my favorite Disney movie as a kid, and I thought the live action version was amazing.
Wow! And Emma Watson portrayed a good Belle?
She made the perfect Belle!
She's one of my favorite actresses, so I didn't want to disappoint myself if I didn't like the movie.
I promise you won't be disappointed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Hercules the Disney animated film version?
Yes, I love the singing women in that movie.
They were a creative choice. It almost was like a greek chorus in drama back in the day.
Yes very much so. Did you know devito was in this film.
You mean a voice in it? no had no clue.
Ya he was the voice of Phil. Or Philoctetes .
I know James wood was the voice of  Hades.
I like how the ended the credits with his character talking.
I am not sure I remember that ending during the credits.
You should rewatch it and watch the credits, pretty entertaining.
XXXXXXXXXXX
User 1: Do you like to watch the Frozen movie?
User 2: I love the Frozen movie! I love Anna and Elsa!
User 1: We also love to watch the Disney short, when it was Anna's Birthday.
User 2: I saw that! I thought it was very funny when Elsa had a cold!
User 1: We also loved how Marshmellow had baby snowmen that came to help decorate for the party!
User 2: Who is your favorite character in Frozen?
User 1: I really like watching Olaf, he is so funny!
User 2: I like Kristoph the most. I like how he was raised by the Trolls.
User 1: I am really excited for the Frozen sequel, I know my daughter will want to see it.
User 2: I am excited to see it as well. It has a really positive message.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which version of the Parent Trap do you like better?
The orginal with Hayley Mill!
I agree! The songs are so great.
And Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith are really cute.
It's really like three different movie.
How so?
Movie 1: 2 girls meet at camp and decide to switch place. Movie 2: 2 girls switch places. Movie 3: Divorced couple gets back together.
Oh, that's good! And I love the California house.
Charlie Ruggles is a great grandfaher as well.
But, I do like Natasha Richardson in the new one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which one on the Book of the Jungle liked you most?
I have mixed feeling toward each one of them. I think both are great!.
What kind of mixed feelings? Can you explain?
Well, when my son was a toddler he loved th animated Book of the Jungle, he even imitate the Baloo dancing and sang his song. But the new one is a great adaptation of the book
Oh. I see. But don´t you think Baloo´s character is kind of diferent in both movies?
Yes, In the 2016 version is Baloo is layziest y a little bit more coward
Maybe, and which is your favorite scene/character in the newer version?
I loved Mowgli, and his interaction with the 3d characters, and the chase scene in King Louie´s palace was espectacular!
What other features liked in this movie?
The ending credits, they were funny, entertained and very, very original.. Many details to watch over and over!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite disney movie?
Well, If I had to choose I would probably choose Aladdin.
Aladdin? I love that movie too! What was your favorite scene?
My favorite scene was when Aladdin sets the Genie free.
That was one of my favorite scenes too! It was so heartfelt.
I agree, I cried when the Genie decided to stay with Aladdin.
Do you think they will ever make a remake?
Possibly, but its going to be hard to find somebody to replace Robin Williams.
maybe a young comedian would be a good genie.
maybe, but he has to have a good voice too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about them making another Toy Story sequel?
I'm not too fond of it, I thought they had a great ending with the third film.
I agree, honestly I didn't think there needed to be a Toy Story 2 or 3 either.
I mean, however you look at it they're fun sequels to a children movie, but agreed.
But what I'm also saying is, I didn't think they needed to exist and both sequels were great films.
That's very true, it's hard to distrust Disney and Pixar at this point.
Definitely, they can really do no wrong in my opinion.
Indeed, even their lesser films are successful and worth the watch.
Indeed, similar to Finding Dory.
Hmmm, see I can't agree I actually hated Finding Dory.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Cars 3 yet?
No I haven't, is it any good?
I thought it was hilarious.  My son loved it too
I saw the first one, but not the second.
Really, the second one was good.  You should see it.
Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes, that was pretty good.
Emma Watson is hot.
Yeah, she is no little girl anymore.
Josh Gad was really good in it also.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Frozen?
Oh, I have so many opinions on Frozen.
Okay, let me hear them.
I like the songs in the movie, especially Let it Go...
It is a classic song, the others are catchy too.
But I'm not a fan of the overhype the movie got.
Like it's popularity?
I think it got very big, very fast.
So fast they're already making a sequel.
Yeah....I'm definetely going to watch it when it comes out too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best Disney villain?
I'm gonna have to go with Jafar.
No way. It has to be Scar.
Let's not forget Ursula from The Little Mermaid.
Oh, she is so scary.
Remember at the end when she got huge?
Yes, that was very cool.
She is the best female villain for sure.
I'm not sure. The wicked queen from Snow White is very good.
I agree. Maybe it is a tie between her and Ursula.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Peter Pan was such a good play and movie
I know I really enjoyed it, I liked the fairies
I have heard a theory that Peter Pan was really a dead boy who was getting other kids who had died
I know,the author of the book had a brother who had passed away
that's right and people think he wrote the book with his brother in mind
the lost boys were great though, they were so messy but took care of themselves
the part when they show how Peter Pan got lost as a baby was sad
I know, he just rolled away down the hill
I wonder why Captain Hook was so angry with Peter Pan, he was a scary man
he was but in the end he had what was coming his way !
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Mulan?
I've seen parts of it.
Oh, it's such a good movie for little girls.
I guess I could see how she could be a role model.
Yeah, she was such a strong character.
Was this based on a true story?
I don't know.  Maybe loosely.
Well, when Disney takes things and bases movies on them, it's usually pretty loose.
Yeah, but they only do it to make a good movie.
As long as kids don't believe inaccuracies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Beauty and the Beast.
Why is it your favorite?
It's a classic. The songs are beautiful and the story line has a good lesson.
Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, I did. It was good.
Did you prefer the new or the old movie?
I preferred the old movie, but the new movie was better than I expected.
What was your favorite part of the new movie?
I liked the addition of the songs, but that Belle and the Beast still had the original story line.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey did you ever watch all the monster inc movies?
there were more than one of them?
yes disney came out with a few others after the first one
no i did not know that there were others, i just saw the first one
well in my opinion that was the best one out of them all
yeah it was a pretty cool story
the disney movies are usually really good at stories
i agree, i liked sully's friend mike the best
yeah he was pretty comedic, let me know if you want to watch the others some time i have them on dvd
oh cool i will definitely let you know about that
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think all of my favorite Disney movies have animals as the main characters.
Really? That's strange. Like which?
Well, when I was a kid I really loved One Hundred and One Dalmatians.
I remember that one clearly too! It has such a great villain.
Yeah. Cruella DeVille is a pretty great name, even.
It's funny to think that it's even set in England.
Disney seems so American to me, it's hard for me to wrap my head around it too.
As a kid I couldn't even really conceptualize it.
I'm glad they picked that setting though. We even had Hugh Laurie play a character in the live action remake!
Now that was a great casting choice!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard your son dressed up as Woody from Toy Story.
Yeah, he looked adorable.
He was missing his best pal though, Buzz Lightyear.  Don't they become friends at the end of the movie?
They do, and we tried to get his friend to dress up as Buzz, but it didn't happen.
That's too bad.
He even had a fake snake in his boot.
Why?
Because Woody would always say, "There's a Snake in My Boot!"
I remember that now,  and "Reach for the Skies."
Yeah, Woody had a lot of great sayings.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Definitely! Have you?
Of course!
Isn't it a stunning movie?
It is! Remember the ballroom dancing scene?
Belle's dress was so beautiful!
I loved how it was very much still like the original animated film, but a little more modern.
And like every Disney movie, great music!
Oh yeah, have to get the soundtrack!
Same here!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh my God wasn't Moana the greatest!
It was cool. Why all the excitement though?
Why all the excitement are you kidding me? Did you not watch the same movie I did? I thoroughly loved it! Maui cracked me me up. I was laughing so hard.
He was alright. I think Grandma Tala was cool.
She was cool too but Maui was my favorite. I liked the message that it sent too. That no matter what do not be afraid to do the impossible. Do not be afraid to pursue your dreams.
You have a point there. I got that too. I liked when the wave knocked Moana over though and she wanted to quit and her Grandmother encouraged her not to quit. Kind of like life. No one promises that it won't get rough when you decide to follow your dreams but the idea is not to quit. Keep on pursuing your dreams no matter how difficult it gets.
Ahem, now look who is getting all philosophical over Moana. (Smiles) You are absolutely right. Do you know I felt so exhilarated after watching it. It really was nice and a gentle reminder.
Did you know that Dwayne Johnson played you beloved Maui.
Yes I do and when I found out I love Maui even more.
You're a nut job you know that, but I am glad you enjoyed the movie. The truth is, I enjoyed it too, I just wanted to give you a hard time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch disney movies?
Yes, do you?
Yes
Have you seen inside out?
That was the cutest movie
I enjoyed it.
It gave a wierd and different perspective to the human body
It did.  I thought the ending was funny where it showed again conteolling the man
And sadness controlling the woman.
They should come out with another one
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've always loved Cinderella.  It's my favorite Disney movie.
It's a classic.  I love the characterizations.
Yes, the mice are so cute.
They're such nice sidekicks for Cinderella.
I love how they try to help her get her ball gown ready.
That's such an endearing part.
The stepmother is a great villain.  So hateful!
She is formidable.  Her daughters are so foolish.
I love that dance that Cinderella has with the Prince at the ball.
It's so romantic when they sing "So This Is Love."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like 'The Incredibles?'
Yes, very much so.
I think one could argue that it was one of the best superhero movies of that year.
I think one could even argue that it was a better 'Fantastic Four' movie than 'Fantastic Four.'
It's really funny that you say that, because there are very similar parallels between the two.
Did you have a favorite character?
I really liked Dash.  How about you?
Elastigirl was my favorite character.  Did you know that Holly Hunter voiced her?
I did not know that.  Any other actor I would know from that cast?
Sure.  Samuel L. Jackson did the voice of Lucius Best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Gaston is my favorite?
Nobody does it like gaston.
True, nobody does, except maybe his effeminate sidekick.
Woah, effeminate? Hes just a nerd is all.
Didn't you see the 2017 live action version?
They remade beauty and the beast?! How could they!
Oh come now, it was great. They made his sidekick totally girly.
Thats uncalled for.
Gaston was great though. Expertly cast.
Well if they did Gaston right, I guess I will have to go check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the best Disney song?
'I'll Make a Man out of You,' from Mulan.  Musically, it is the best written song.
That's a great choice.  Mulan was also my favorite movie overall.
Likewise.  It was empowering to women, and also the first Disney movie with such a big Asian cast.
Now that you mention it, Disney really didn't have that much Asian representation.  I hope they do so more.
I hope so too.  Representation matters, and I'm glad Disney is at least making an effort.
Who was your favorite character?
Mooshoo was so funny to me as a kid.
As an adult, I still find him funny.
Eddie Murphy was the perfect person to voice Mooshoo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey , Let's go watch a movie tonight.
Sure , which movie do you have in mind?
I was thinking Beauty and the Beast.
Nice, do you know who the actors are in this one?
Emma Watson is playing Belle and Dan Stevens is playing the Beast.
Cool, they are both nice actors , who is playing Gaston?
It's Luke Evans.
Okay. Is Dan Stevens wearing make up for his Beast costume?
No, they are using full body CGI suit , which will imitate his every action and emotion correctly on a Computer Generated Image.
Wow , Nice technology!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I always thought I had seen a lot of Disney movies, but apparently not...
There's a lot of Disney movies, so it's not surprising if there's some you haven't seen.
There was a list challenge website that had 492 Disney movies, and you could click on each one that had a picture and the title that you'd seen, and it gave you a total.
That kind of sounds like fun. Did it take a long time?
YES. About a half an hour. It was 13 pages of Disney movies.
So how many have you seen?
67 out of 492. The average was 164. A LOT of people had claimed to have seen all 492, but I think they just cheated and clicked on them all.
I know it seems like I've seen a lot, but I'm probably just like you.
It was fun looking at all the old movie pictures, like Bambi and Cinderella, and 101 Dalmatians.
The old Disney movies are my favorite too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have that Christina Aguilera song stuck in my head. From that Disney film.
You mean the one that takes place in China?
Yeah, Mulan. I used to love that film.
Same, but I have to say I remember more about the soundtrack than I do about the film.
You and me both, actually. That's why that song is stuck in my head.
It's a good one, but that "Make a Man Out of You" song was the big one.
Did you know that song was actually sung by Donny Osmond?
Are you serious? That's so funny!
I know! I think I want to watch the movie again now.
You should. It's one of the last great animated films!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Aladdin was the 31st Disney animated feature?
How interesting. I remember really enjoying seeing that film at the cinema.
It was based on the Arab-style folktale, Aladdin and the Magic Lamp.
The genie in Aladdin was very funny.
Yes, Robin Williams played the role of the genie.
No wonder, he was so funny.
Jasmine, I think, was the start of a new kind of Disney Princess.
In what way?
Jasmine was more rebellious against the royal life than other princesses.
I see what you mean; she had the spirit of adventure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Um.. Wreck It Ralph.
Really? That's pretty modern for a 90s kid like yourself.
Are you saying I'm too old to watch Disney movies?
No I just thought you'd pick something older like Aladdin, The Lion King, or even Toy Story.
Well... if I had to pick something from my childhood then it'd probably be The Rescuers or yeah Aladdin was another favorite.
That's more like it. Mine is Beauty and the Beast and DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp.
Oh? Did you see the recently released live action Beauty and the Beast with Emma Watson?
I was there at the midnight premier! They did an absolutely fantastic job with it!
I couldn't agree more. Disney has been doing an amazing job with their live action reimaginings like Maleficent and Cinderella.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you guess which Disney film this song is from.
OK
Let's get down to business.
To defeat the Huns! Ha ha, that's obviously Mulan, I've watched it literally a hundred times.
Me too. Can't wait for the live-action remake.
Wait they're making a live-action remake.
Yep, it comes out next year I think.
I hope Ming-na Wen reprises her role as Mulan, she's such a total badass.
She's also as swift as a coursing river, with all the force of a great typhoon.
She's also got all of the strength of a raging fire and is as mysterious as the dark side of the moon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you noticed that all the Disney princesses have animal sidekicks?
What do you mean?
Well, like Cinderella has her mice that help make her dress, and Snow White has all the forest animals that help clean the house.
Oh, and Jasmine has her tiger and Pocahontas has the hummingbird and raccoon!
Exactly!
What would your animal sidekick be if you were a Disney princess?
Good question. I'd want to be some kind of forest princess, so any kind of forest animal I guess.
I like that. I'd want a wolf or bear, or something fierce like that.
Mulan had a dragon, that's pretty fierce.
Not sure if you could call Mushu fierce!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you check out that  "Brave" movie?
Yes, i did in last month.
oh well, What do you think about that movie?
It's a wonderful movie full about women's freedom.
Yes, i agreed thereof, But in climax women's freedom goes a wrong path.
Can you remember me the Heroine character name? i forgot a little.
Merida, and its a very small name , now you remember?
Yes, you are correct , by the way which scene you like most in that movie?
The Game scene in that merida's entry, It's marvelous isn't it?
Well, of course i am also liked that scene very much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Finding Nemo a Disney movie?
Yeah.
Wait, I thought it was Pixar.
Disney bought Pixar a while ago.
Wow. So Cars is a Disney movie too?
It sure is.
Wow. Ok, Lightning McQueen is my new favorite Disney princess.
Haha. I don't think he counts.
Hey, men can be princesses too!
He's not a man, he's a car!
XXXXXXXXXXX
After Beauty and the Beast, what other classic movie do you think they will turn into a live-action film?
I heard they plan to do that with the Lion King.
Do you think that would work? Since there aren't any people in the movie?
They will be using CGI animals.
Isn't that basically the same as animating them?
Pretty similar I guess. But it will look more real.
I love the Lion King and the music is great, so I would still go see it.
Yeah, I would too.
I guess it is a good idea for Disney to do.
I guess so too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I re-watched Lilo and Stitch today, before I let the kids watch it.  Now I can't stop crying.
Oh my goodness.  Just hearing the name of the movie makes my eyes tear up.
Yeah it does.  With the "leave me alone to die" and the photograph...
And the doll! And Jumba telling Stitch he can't be good!
I think it's extra touching, because the storyline is so real.
I agree. The real threat isn't the aliens or dragons or monsters, it's being separated from your family.
Have you decided if you will let your kids watch it?
I haven't decided yet.  The kids would be fine, but I am worried I'll start crying my eyes out in front of them.
Fun fact that might cheer you up.  When Stitch shocks everyone with what he licks on his cage, it's the Disney logo he licks.
Hilarious!  Now I'm laughing through my tears.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you gotten a chance to watch Moana yet?
Yes! I loved it so much! The music was awesome.
I know! How far I'll Go is my favorite song. It was so deep.
I know I don't live like her but I feel like I can relate so much! I bet lots of young girls feel that way, too.
It's also cool that Dwayne Johnson played Maui. He made a great demigod.
Is that who that was? I knew I recognized the voice! His song You're Welcome is so catchy.
It's also a great story, don't you think?
Definitely. She had to be strong and follow her heart to save her tribe. Not a lot of Disney princesses do that!
They don't! And most Disney princesses meet a prince and fall in love, it's cool that she was independent.
I agree. She's so inspirational for young girls!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know of any Disney movies coming out in 2017.
Yeah, actually. I think I can name a few.
What movies are coming out.
Well, I know that there's Cars 3, Lou, and Coco.
Cars 3! I hope we get more of the backstory about where all of the humans went.
Yeah! Why do the cars have doors and seats if there are no humans?
It really doesn't make sense. What could have killed off all the humans, but not the Cars?
I don't think it was nuclear war because that'd probably destroy the cars.
Yeah, it's kind of dark for a kids movie when you think about it.
Very dark! Although, I think that level of inference is beyond the abilities of most of the young kids watching it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in the Jungle Book?
I think King Louie is the best.
He is very funny.
I like Shere Khan.
Wow, he is very bad.
Yeah, but his voice was so cool.
Do you think it is cooler than Scar's from The Lion King?
I think so.
The Jungle Book is great.
Yes, it is one of the best cartoons ever made.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of the movie, The Cat From Outer space?
I sort of remember it.
My Mom told me I loved the movie.
So, don't you remember it?
No, not really.
When was it out?
In the late seventies.
I don't know the movie either.
She said Sandy Duncan was in it.
Now I remember that actress.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you feel about moana?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't remember-- which Disney movie did "When You Wish Upon A Star" come from?
That's from Pinocchio.
Thanks, I remember now! Jiminy Cricket was so cute.
Yeah, and Pinocchio sure needed Jiminy Cricket to be his conscience.
That movie had a good message for kids about lying and disobeying.
I agree, and it was presented with the usual Disney magic.
True, it taught kids a lesson without being too preachy.
Looking at the state of the world today, some people really needed to see Pinocchio when they were kids.
It's too bad real people's noses don't grow every time they lie.
Yeah. It would make my life easier if they did!
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey do you know when the new incredibles is coming out
no, i really dont think they will make one
i know it has been a while but im still hopeful
the first one came out so long ago, i doubt a second one is coming
true but how the first one ended it set up a sequel
that is a good point, but dont you think it would of been made  by now?
Yeah, but sometimes you have to wait for the really good ones
Talk about really waiting, because it has been ten plus years
Well i am going to keep the hope alive and ill message disney myself
good luck with that and let me know how it goes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Toy Story?
Are you talking about the original film?
Yes I am.
That movie is the best!
Haha yes I watched it again recently, it was really great.
Wow was it good the second time.
Since I first saw it many years ago, I really enjoyed watching it now.
Wow that is interesting.
Yes it was super funny, usually I dont laugh at comedies the second time, but this one I did.
I really like to laugh, so I plan on watching it again too, thank you for telling me this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally rewatched the lion king last night.
I loved that movie, it was sad.
Yea, but it had great music.
Hakuna Matada was my favorite saying.
What did you think about the the sequels?
I liked them, but the original can't be beat.
They even had a tv show, but its nowhere near as good as the movies.
Simba was my favorite character.
I thought the animations were really good for its time.
Yea, they still hold up in 2017.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie with Emma Watson?
I haven't, but I liked the animated version.
The animated version was pretty good, the real to life one is better though.
What other Disney movies do you like?
101 Dalmations is my favorite. I'm an animal lover.
That's a great movie. I love Pongo and Perdita.
The puppies are so cute. Especially Roly, the chubby one.
I liked the twilight bark, when the dogs came together to save the puppies.
Cruella Deville is a nasty villain.
The movie kept you on the edge of your seat. For being animated, it was really good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like beauty and the beast?
I have not watched it yet, how did you like it?
I didn't really care for it, but my son loved it.
Really, what did he like about it.
He is very smart and he enjoyed the storyline.
Oh yes, there is a great storyline in that movie.
He was engaged the entire time in the movie.
It is great that he was focused on something positive.
It was a good learning experience for him.
Sounds great, I'll make sure my children watch that movie as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the best Disney villain?
I personally think it was Queen Grimhilde.
Which one was she again?
She was the one who poisoned Snow White because she was jealous of Snow White's looks.
I remember now.  It's also extra evil that she poisoned someone who was her own stepdaughter.
That's why she is my pick.  What about yours?
I think Ursula from 'The Little Mermaid' was way worse.
What was her evil plan again?
She used blackmail and deceit to win King Triton’s throne.
I would say that in my opinion, the two characters are very comparable in terms of who is more evil.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was looking at a list the other day and you would be absolutely shocked at the number of Disney films that were live action from the 1950s until now.
Really? That's not what I think of when I think of Disney.
I know! You usually think of the animated classics that they've made and rightfully so! I think almost everyone I know has seen Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Yeah and those movies were made way before anyone our age was born.
But because they're classics we've seen them. I bet there are lots of Disney films you didn't remember were DIsney, like The Parent Trap!
The one with Lindsay Lohan?
No! The one with Hayley Mills. Come on you remember, its the exact same story. The LIndsay Lohan one is remake.
That's the girl that plays Polyanna! I loved that movie. It's the one about an orphan in a small town and she's really cheerful and everyone grows to love her.
Yeah I remember. Anyways, there are about 50 more live action movies that Disney has made.
Well maybe we should go rewatch some of those ones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the name of that Disney movie with the Elephant?
Do you mean Dumbo?
Yes, that's the one.  Have you seen it?
Seen it? It's my favourite Disney movie of all time!
I love the way Dumbo eventually flies and proves all the other elephant wrong.
It is sad though that he isn't with his mother at the beginning.
Yes it is but he does have Timothy Mouse.
That movie was made in 1941!
Really? It has stood the test of time though... it's an all time classic.
Totally agree. Disney sure now how to write them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Queen of Katwe yet from Disney?
No but I heard it was really good.
Yeah it was a different kind of movie for them.
I think it was based on a true story too.
I think it was. I still haven't seen Finding Dory yet.
Oh me neither but I heard it will make you cry.
I heard the same thing. Finding Nemo definitely did.
That's a classic. My kids wanted a clown fish after seeing it.
Oh that's cute. Ellen Degeneres did a good job of playing Dory.
Yes she's hilarious, I love her in anything she does.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That new Disney movie Moana turned out to be pretty good, eh?
The Rock has a good voice. I've never heard of him doing a cartoon before!
It was probably something pretty new to him, but yeah I agree.
They were loyal to the Polynesian culture. Pretty cool to see.
Hawaii hasn't had a Disney film since Lilo and Stitch. It was very respectful.
The songs were very good and rehearsed well.
Yeah, my kids can't stop singing a few of them.
A lot of good jokes in there so it's not too boring for adults to watch.
I agree, I found myself laughing more than I thought I would.
I liked how there wasn't a love story involved at all. Completely new for Disney.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the live adaptation of Beauty and the Beast?
Oh yes, it was horrid.
The Disney version has always been a childhood favorite of mine, but they totally butchered the new version.
I had always imagined a real-life version of Belle would be someone with sweet, gentle features. I don't know, Emma Watson's pretty, but she's not what I had in mind.
Agreed, plus her acting just made me cringe.
Nothing beats the Disney version.
What did you think of the cinematography?
Some of the casting members might have been poor choice, but the scenery was absolutely stunning.
Yeah, the director did a nice job there. It reminded me of the French version of the movie.
If I were to compare the two, I'd go with the French version.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Disney is making a live-action remake of Mulan?
Really? When will it be in theaters?
It's not being released until November 2, 2018.
That's a while off. Has a cast list been released yet?
No not yet. The film is still in pre-production.
I can't wait! Mulan, is one of my favorite movies.
Same, I love the story and music. Though it's not clear yet if they'll be adapting the songs as well.
I hope they include the songs. I'd love to see a live-action version of "I'll Make A Man Out of You".
Me too. Disney also needs to keep Mushu, the dragon, in.
He'd probably be computer-generated. It'd be cool if Eddie Murphy could voice Mushu again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the saddest scene you have ever scene in a Disney movie?
Well, there is when Mufasa dies in "The Lion King."
Classic tearjerker scene, my man.
Really, but you know I think I've cried harder with a different movie.
I think I know which because I cried too, I hate to admit it.
Which one, then, guess?
"Lilo and Stitch."
Wow, right on the money.
He just wanted a family! He learned to be good and HE JUST WANTED A FAMILY!
You better stop, if I cry I am not hanging out with you anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really love the classic Disney movies.
Me too!  The newer ones just aren't as good as the classics.  Which one is your favorite?
I love Cinderella.  Such a great story line!
I love the princess movies.  I think Snow White is my favorite.
I like the older ones because they were based on so many classic fairy tales.
The new ones just don't compare.
No they don't! I do like a few of the newer ones though.
Me too.  I thought Frozen was pretty good.
I agree.  I like a lot of the Disney-Pixar movies like Toy Story.
I like that one too....and the Monsters Inc movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Disney movie Mulan?
Yes I've seen it many times. It's one of my favorites.
One of the first to feature a strong female lead that stands up for herself.
I think that was part of the appeal with Frozen. That whole independence theme.
Right and it was the same way with Brave. I loved her hair in that movie.
I saw a special where they did a behind the scenes and each strand of her hair was meticulously done.
You can tell. Pocahontas was a great movie too although I disagree with the historical accuracy.
Right you just have to view it as it is, a kids movie.
I grew up on Disney though. I love looking for the little easter eggs, the references to other Disney movies.
Oh and Moana is another movie with a strong female lead. There were a few references in that movie as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Ursula was really bad?
Yes! She was the villiain of the whole film.
I suppose that is true, I just always felt sympathy for her plight.
Just because you felt badly for her does not make her a saint.
True, I just did not see her as evil as I guess she was.
She was evil, she tricks Ariel to gain rulership of the sea.
I am not saying she did not do some bad things. I suppose I just need to admit she is evil.
Yes, yes you do. You can still enjoy her, I do.
I will always enjo ursula. She had some great numbers. Think I just wanted to make her out to be not so bad.
We are what we are. She is a villiain with a good voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that movie Big Hero 6?
Yeah, I loved it!
I just saw it last night and thought it was great!
I really like the technology Hero comes up with.  Do you think someone will invent that some day?
Absolutely!  Don't you think they're already working on it?
I'm not sure.  I think those movies are just made up.
Oh, I think there's a kernel of truth in what they imagine.  I bet someone is already working on it.  Technology moves so fast these days!
Really?  I don't know mind controlled bots that can create anything you think of? Don't you think that's a little far fetched?
No way!  You can control the internet with glasses, bots are next!
Maybe.  Still seems a little out there to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Disney is making a live action film about Cruella De Vil?
Cruella De Vil? She's the one from 101 Dalmations, right?
Yeah. She's the one who wanted to make a fur coat out the puppies!
Yikes, now I remember! I hated her!
Me too! I still think a movie about her backstory will be interesting though.
Have they already finished casting?
I think so. I read that Emma Stone will be playing Cruella in the film.
Emma Stone? That's a surprising choice.
I think so too, but she's a great actress.
You're right, I bet she'll do great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to go to Neverland.
Neverland? As in Peter Pan's home?
Of course! I want to be Wendy.
Now that you mention it, I do too.
Except I'd never leave. Who would leave that place?
Yeah, there's no reason to grow up. It's awful.
Peter had it right. Peter and Tinkerbell.
Tinkerbell is my favorite.
Wendy is such a wet blanket. Peter is better off without her.
Poor Wendy! She's not that bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where is Ariel from?
Under the sea
Isn't that  song from the movie too?
Is Sebastian a crab?
Yes
He sings the song right?
Yes
That is a good song
I agree
That movie has a lot of good songs
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favourite Disney movie as a kid?
I'd say Aladdin. It was pretty darn cool.
It had a lot going on. Robin Williams as the Genie was just genius.
Completely. It was one of his best roles. He was hilarious.
It had a good villain too. Jafar right?
Yeah, he was scary as hell. Almost too scary for a kid's movie.
But at least he was a villain with some actual threat right?
I suppose. I mostly just wanted my own magic carpet.
Yes! The Carpet was so awesome. It had a ton of personality for a rug.
Exactly. Forget the gold and jewels, just give me the Carpet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new version of Pete's Dragon by Disney?
No but I heard it got good reviews.
Yeah it was great,even for fans of the first version.
Now I saw THAT one.  It was funny.
They made Elliott into a digital dragon, really cool. The actors were probably fans of the first.
Who was in it?
Robert Redford, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Wes Bentley.
Sounds like a good cast. What were the differences?
The cast, music, and story points. You should see it.
I'll keep an eye out for the dvd.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just read something interesting about Harrison Ford and getting the part of Han Solo.
What's that?
He never auditioned for the part.
Then how did he get it?
He was helping other actors run their lines when George Lucas was casting and after awhile, Lucas realized that Ford was perfect for the part.
How lucky is that?
And do you know how much he got paid for A New Hope?
I have no idea.
Only $10,000.
That's nothing!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the Parent Trap was a Disney movie?
I was unaware to be honest with you.
I didnt mind it at all.
The original or the newer one.
The original.
I thought it was a slick idea as far as the twins went.
The twins were actually only played by one person.
Yeah thats crazy they can do that.
I always wonder how that kind of scene is shot.
Its definitely a different and awkward way to film I am sure
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No, I haven't. Have you?
Yes, I really enjoyed it actually.
Really? Why?
I thought the story was actually a bit different than the others.
Were the same characters there?
Yes, and of course Jack Sparrow
I wonder how you could do it without him?
Johnny Depp was great as always.
He really made his career (again) in that role. I wonder what he could do in the future?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite part about Princess and the Frog?
The part where it ended.
Oh my, you didnt like it?
No it felt forced.
In what manner?
Some of the songs did not sound right.
Do you think they rushed it?
No I just dont think they cared much for it.
I dont agree with that.
Why not? They were pusing a left wing agenda.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Back when I was an ESL teacher, I used to use clips from Disney movies to help the kids learn English.
That sounds like a lot of fun! How would you do it.
Well, I'd find a clip that related to the lesson somehow. Or we'd talk about the lyrics in a song.
What movies did you use?
I only had copies of Beauty and the Beast and Hercules, so mostly those two.
I bet the kids would've liked something newer!
Probably! But they still got a kick out of roleplaying.
You had them act out the scenes?
Yeah, right after watching them. It was fun!
I bet!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any Disney movies recently?
Yes I saw Enchanted.
Oh my gosh I love that movie!
I love Amy Adams and James Marsden in it.
They make a cute couple in the movie.
I love princess movies, they are cute.
I wish they would do a sequel to that.
Oh me too. But maybe one day they will.
Let us hope.
Nice talking to you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I recently saw the movie Moana.
I saw that movie too.
Yeah, I was surprised but I really liked it?
What did you like about it?
I liked that it had a new theme to it.
I liked that it was about the ocean too.
What was your favorite part in the movie?
It was when Moana first went to the ocean by herself and the ocean was nice to her and gave her the shell.
Yeah, I liked that part too.
We should get it when it comes out on DVD.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Finding Nemo?
Years and years ago.
What was the name of the fish from that movie?
Flounder?
No, that's Little Mermaid.
Nemo?
Of course not.  That's the movie title?
What fish are you talking about?  The blue one or the dad?
The blue fish he befriends.
Oh!  That's Dory!  The Dad is Marlin, do I get bonus points?
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey do you remember the movies cinderella?
yeah of course that was a disney classic
well i want to feel like cinderella for tonights school dance
i dont think you are in the same place as cinderella
why do you say that?
well you arent locked in your room, or have mean step sisters like she did
oh good point, but more of meeting my prince charming
oh i should of known that was what you were getting at. Well just lose your shoe tonight and there you go
you are so right, ill do it on purpose and find true love
sure will, now just go buy some glass slippers
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Frozen
No, never
Really? That's surprising
Well I don't have any kids
Ah, I guess that makes sense
Is it any good?
Actually it's not too bad. Some good songs and a  decent story line.
I've heard of Let it Go
Yes, that's the big song
Drives me nuts every time I hear it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the next Disney Pixar movie coming out this year?
No, what is it?
I think it is called Coco. It centers around the Mexican Day of the Dead.
El Dia de Los Muertos? No, I haven't heard. When is it coming out?
I think it is coming out in October.
Oh that makes sense; around Halloween.
Yes. It looks like it will be very good.
Will it have sugar skulls in it?
Oh definitely. The animation looks very nice and I think I've seen those.
I like how Disney has become more multicultural.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I really like Peter Pan.
Yeah, that's a great one. It's very funny. I especially like the interaction between Captain Hook and the Croc.
What's your favorite?
I would probably say The Jungle Book.
The original or the new one?
The original, although the new one was quite good.
Yeah, I thought the CGI looked really great in the new movie.
But it didn't have the same heart and soul as the old one.
I agree with that. The original movie had a special feeling that can't be recreated.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well you know what I always say, "Hakuna Matata".
Are you seriously quoting me The Lion King mottos right now?
Well I'd say Timon and Pumba knew how to live life.
Except for the fact that it meant Simba was just going to leave behind everyone he loved.
Let's give Simba a break here okay. His evil Uncle Scar tricked him into thinking he killed Mufasa!
Yeah Scar was a pretty bad dude.
Simba did eventually come back to take down Scar and become the rightful leader of Pride Rock.
All's well that ends well.
Hey did you know that The Lion King was based on Shakespeare's Hamlet?
I didn't know that! It makes sense though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you consider Pixar movies the same as Disney movies?
I do now, but for a while I viewed them as separate things.
I wonder how interconnected the two studios are at this point?
I figure they're pretty well-connected. I think John Lasseter runs both of them.
I wish John Lasseter ran the entire company.
I agree with that. He seems like a very creative and intelligent guy.
What's your favorite Pixar film?
I love Ratatouille. That's definitely my favorite.
Yeah, that's a great one.
I've probbably seen it about 5 times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So have you ever seen Atlantis?
The Stargate series?
No, no, I mean the Disney animated movie.
Is that the one with like. Kida and Milo?
Yep, that's the one! I just watched it the other day and I really loved it.
It's a fun movie for sure. All of the characters are really original and quirky.
Mole is my favourite. The scene where he freaks out over the dirt is the best!
Haha, yes, "England must never merge with France!"
I like the engineer girl too; she was cool without being too in your face about it.
And of course Milo is just super adorkable. I had a bit of a crush on him when I first watched it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about Wall-E?
Oh, I fell in love with both the movie and the little robot the first time I saw it
not surprised, it's such a romantic trip between 2 robots
it's hard, isn't it? to make a romantic movie that's for kids, and it's between robots.
it's difficult to think about indeed, but Disney did it again.
what's your most memorable moments from that movie?
I think it's definitely the wheel chair scene, where men no longer needs to walk, they go everywhere with elevated chairs
it's terrifying to think about, but I have seen some recent tech trends trying to push into that direction
Human just want to get lazy, don't they
yep, that's why we invent robots, so they can do the hard labor
XXXXXXXXXXX
Over the weekend, we watched The Little Mermaid.
I love that movie, its my favorite.
The girls loved to watch Sebastian and Ariel.
I loved that song "Under the Sea."
I loved Ariel's voice its so pretty.
I think Ariel was played by Jodi Benson.
I loved when Ariel left the sea to go find Eric.
My favorite character was Ursula the sea witch.
I loved that it had a happy ending.
Yes, Triton lets Ariel have legs and she goes to marry Eric!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
I will probably see it when it comes out on DVD. I've seen all the previous ones.
I don't know how I feel about it. The series has gone a little stale.
Yeah, I feel like Captain Jack Sparrow's character has gotten old.
The first movie was awesome, but it seems like they are really milking it now.
I think that's true of all movie series.
Having said that, I will probably still see it.
I still am a Johnny Depp fan, but I won't waste money and time going to the theater.
I much prefer him as Captain Jack Sparrow than the Mad Hatter in the Alice in Wonderland movies.
No disagreement from me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite Disney Movie?
It´s called a Goffy Movie.
Really? I have not heard about it. What is is about?
It´s about Goofy´s son in his teen years.
Oh wow! That sounds interesting. What happens in the movie.
He falls in love and is trying to impress a girl.
Why is it called a Goofy Movie?
Because Goofy is still Goofy and he sometimes messes his son life.
But does it have a happy ending?
It does! I recommend it, it has a touchy moment with his dad and he gets the girl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite song from any Disney movie?
Lion King has always been very memorable for me with Elton John's Circle of Life song.
Lion King is always on everyone's top list because of the memorable songs in there plus it's one of Disney's most powerful animations too!
I also think it's underrated but I liked Phil Collins song in the 1999 Disney Tarzan movie.
You mean You'll Be In My Heart?
Yeah that one! It makes me irrationally choke up every time I hear it!
That's funny. I don't want to say the cliche response, but Frozen's Let It Go is really, really good.
Let it Go will be always so memorable because of how great Frozen was as a whole. Disney really knocked it out of the ballpark with that film.
I think the songs relate to how good and memorable the Disney movie is.
Yeah the best ones will have the most memorable songs. Aladdin, Pocahontas, The Lion King, Frozen, Beauty and the Beast!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the previews for the new Cars movie?
Is that in 3D?
It is and i think I'm looking forward to it as much as My kids.
My family fell in love with the Cars Characters..
Really, who is your favorite?
Mater!!!! Larry the cable guy did an amazing job bringing him to life.
Fillmore Reminds me of a teacher I had in highschool.
I've heard the new movie Has a Bit of a darker twist to it.
Do you know what day it  comes out?
Fathers day, We are going to take the kids to the drive-in to see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Everyone goes on about how great Frozen is but Tangled is so much better.
So true. "When will my life begin" is just the best song again.
Is that when she's cleaning the floor with her hair.
Yeah, so unhygenic.
Well in Rapunzel's defence she was locked in a tower her entire life with just her hair and an evil witch.
True, also what is it with Disney and evil witches?
What do you mean?
All the villains are evil witches.
Sometimes they're evil animals.
And sometimes the villain is just mankind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the new Mulan movie is coming out!
I know im so excited!
I wonder if they will still have that cute racoon?
I hope they still have that racoon, he was so awesome!
When is it coming out so we can see it together?
Looks like November 2nd, 2018
I cant wait!
I know!
She truly is a princess!
And can see ALL the colors of the WIND!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you watch Disney movies as a kid?
Actually, I didn't watch that many. Why, do you want to watch one?
I was definitely one of those kids that was super into Disney. My favorite was the Lion King.
Yeah, now that I'm Googling it it turns out a lot of movies I watched were Disney! Just mostly live-action movies.
Oh! Did you ever see 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea?
Yes-that one was my favorite! It made me want to be a marine biologist. I also loved Treasure Planet.
That one is animated though, right?
Yep! I didn't say every single one I'd seen was live-action, though.
Well if you haven't seen the Lion King yet, you better!
That's what everyone says. I guess I'm just stubborn!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe they are releasing another Toy Story.
I thought the last one was the final one?
Nope!  They are making another one.  It's coming out next year.
What could the storyline possibly be?
I think it's about how Woody and Bo Beep fall in love.
Oh, okay.  I guess that's alright.  Still, I think they need to just end it.
I know!  It's hard to believe the first one was out when I was a kid.
It's crazy to think about several generations of people loving the same franchise.
I guess that's how you know a movie is really great.
Yes, it's has a timeless quality to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo, Johnny, you gonna watch Coco?
What up Big Steve, what is that like fashion or something?
Nah dawg, its some straight up, incredible visual, Cinco de Mayo theme movie man!
For real? That sounds trippy!
Yeah man, its lit. The trailer is lit, awesome trailer man!
Ooooo, I gotta see it. I'll bring my homies, and my boys, and my family.
Yeah man, in the Coco movie, the boy was running around in the spirit realm, so beautiful!
Yeah man, I heard you the first time.
This movie is going to be the popping Disney movie of 2017.
For sure man, I hope its good. I'm buying my whole family movie tickets.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Disney movie is your favorite?
wow, that's a tough question. There are so many Disney movies.
That's true, what do you think about Pirates of Carribean?
Oh, right. I almost thought Disney only makes animations
that would be a mistake, Disney make all sorts of movies in fact. So do you like Pirates of Carribean?
Oh yea, I remember seeing Jack Sparrow fighting for the cursed coin on TV, I was so exciting that I jumped around
haha, that's pretty dramatic
yea, that was in fact the first time I seeing any pirates of carribean movie, since then I was addicted to it
do you know there is a new one coming out this year?
oh yeah, we have to see it at the theater then
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you exited about the Last Jedi Star Wars movie?
Yea I consider myself a fan of those movies.
Do you know when its coming out?
I heard it was coming out in December this year, im pretty exited about that.
Yeah I am exited about that too. I want to watch it bady.
I am curious about the Jedi fighting.
I think this is one of the things the other Star War movies are missing more light saver action.
Yeah I know and it will be cool to see Luke in action.
Hopefully it will be a great movie.
Yeah, I have high hopes for it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love disney movies
Me too!
They sre so great
I love Frozen
Me too
Im really suprised at how popular it was
I think it was the song
A lot of teenages can relate to that song
Let it go?
Yes that one
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Pinocchio?
There are scenes I like but overall I did not.
The scene where he is talking about the strings attached to him.
I think that was probably the best one.
Thats some generous words.
I just think it stood for more than what was in front of you.
I agree it was a great scene.
And also where Jiminy Crickett was offering advice.
He did that alot.
That was sort of his role for the film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Alice and Wonderland films are there?
I'm not sure, I think there are a lot of them.
My daughter especially loves the 2010 film
Really, why do you say that?
She watches it weekly.
Wow, it loves like Disney has their hands full with your daughter!
Haha, I agree. Does your daughter have any favorite Disney films?
She likes 101 Dalmatians.
That is a classic.
Agreed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Like, of all time? That's too hard. You'd have to divide it into, like, pre-Pixar and post-Pixar.
Okay. What's your favorite pre-Pixar movie?
Sleeping Beauty. Hands down. That movie is absolutely beautiful. And the characters are great.
Is that the one with the dwarfs?
Uh, no, you're thinking of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." The one with Dwarfs in the title. Sleeping Beauty has the witches.
Oh yeah, the three little witches. The pink one, blue one, and green one.
Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. Plus Maleficent.
She's the bad guy?
Wait, have you not seen this movie? Oh my god. Sit down, we are watching this movie RIGHT NOW.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Over the years, what has bene your favorite Disney franchise?
I’d have to say, Toy Story. Even as a grown adult, there is just something about those movies that are very charming.
Do you think any part of it has to do with the nostalgic factor?
Perhaps a little bit, yes. That being said, I just think they are good movies, overall.
I certainly see your point. Not only is the CGI on point, but I also love the voice cast and the story.
Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have great chemistry, also, in my opinion.
I second that point, too. What was your favorite movie out of the three so far?
Definitely, the first. The second was great, but I still think the original was the best.
I agree. I just think the flow of the first movie was the best, too.
That being said, Toy Story was just a very well-done set of movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever wonder if Snow White hates animals?
What are you talking about?
I mean, she thanks the animals for helping her, but seems like she's short on gratitude.
I swear, you're going crazy.
Hear me out.  Why didn't she take any of them as pets at the end?
How was she supposed to take them on pets when she was on the back of a horse?
She could have taken a rabbit.
She's not going to take wild beasts with her and the prince.
Or a cuddly mouse.
You need serious help.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Inside Out?
Yes, but I didn't like it at all.
Really? Why?
Sadness ruined it for me. She was always depressed and ruining things.
That was the goal of her character.
I understand that, but it was almost annoying how she wouldn't listen to Joy.
That's true.
Some of the storyline was hard to understand. How Riley's memories were stored in colorful balls.
I think that was to represent her brain.
True, but it didn't look like a brain to me. It was almost like a factory the way it worked. Strange.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever head of the movie Bolt that Disney made?
That's the one about the dog who thinks it really has super powers but is just an actor for a show right?
Yup that movie.
Yeah I have and I have seen it too. It was alright.
It seems to be one of the less known movies they did I think.
True I never really heard much about it even when it first came out.
Still I feel like it was a good movie and John Travolta did a good job for the voice.
Yeah he was a good choice.
I think what made the movie the best was the banter between Bolt, Rhino and Mittens.
Yes, those guys antics were hilarious especially Rhinos.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched 101 Dalmations the other day.
The live-action version, or the original one?
The original one. I forgot how good it is!
Yeah, it's a really fun movie.
I like the style of animation it uses. It's kind of stylized, and it fits the setting.
And all the puppies are so cute!
I really like Cruella de Vil as a villain, too.
Oh, she's one of the great Disney villains!
Her look is so distinctive, with her black and white hair.
You just shudder when she comes on screen, and that's part of what makes the movie great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite animated Disney movie?
Snow White, hands down.
Why Snow White?
I saw it as a child and then again in the 1980s when it was re-released in the theaters.
What about it makes you like it?
The art of the animators. The scenery looks so lifelike.
Yeah, I do recall being impressed by that, too.
The water in the waterfall looks real.
What else do you like about it?
The music. I remember in the 80s when the first notes of Hi Ho were sung I got chills and teared up a little. It's such an iconic movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Aladdin?
The Disney movie?  Yeah, I liked it.
What was your favorite part?
I loved the Genie.  Robin Williams was hillarious.
Wasn't there an animated series for Aladdin?
I don't know.  There might have been.
I think I remember watching it after school.
I know there was one for Hercules.
I do remember that one.
It would be right up Disney's alley to have turned Hercules into an animated series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's a movie from Disney that's underrated?
I think about Beauty and the Beast.
Oh yeah, that was a good movie.
Disney really likes implementing magic in their movies.
Yeah, the prince got what he deserved though.
He was very ugly on the inside and became that way on the outside.
It also shows acceptance by appearance.
Yes, people can still be beautiful on the inside.
It's a very touching movie.
I know I always enjoyed the whole thing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
tangled was totally underrated
it was!
frozen just showed up and completely overshadowed a really cute movie
yeah, rapunzel's relationship with her fake mother was really relatable
if only our abusive mothers were fake, eh?
if only
and flynn rider! easily the best disney prince
definitely the cutest disney prince
are cartoons allowed to be cute?
yeah, i think so
XXXXXXXXXXX
What upcoming Disney films are you looking forward to watching?
I am really looking forward to the Incredibles 2.
I loved the first Incredibles.
Me too. My kids can't wait to see it.
When exactly does it come out?
It is scheduled to be released in June of 2018.
That is so far away!
I know. I hope it is worth the wait.
I bet it will be. The first Incredibles really delivered.
You are right. Let's watch the first one in the meantime!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Brave?
Yes - it's one of my favorite Disney movies in a long time.
Merida is such a cool Disney princess.
Her hair is perfect, too!
I was glad that she didn't have to get married until she chose to.
Guess all it took was turning her mom into a bear.
As with every Disney movie, it all worked out in the end.
What was your favorite song?
I liked the "Learn Me Right" Mumford and Sons song.
I liked that they used Gaelic songs in the film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to see the new "Descendants" movie this summer.
Oh yeah, I remember seeing the first one with all the singing and dancing.
Yes, those actors are really talented. Who played the daughter of Maleficent?
Dove Cameron. She's in lots of Disney stuff.
Yes, I like that show Liv and Maddie. Cameron Boyce is good too.
Yes, He plays Cruella De'vill's son in the movie.
Do you know any new characters that will be in the new Descendants movie?
I heard Ursula's daughter is in it.
Cool. Who's playing that part?
An actress named China Anne McClain.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Cinderella was such a good movie, I loved her slippers.
I know, I wish glass slippers were a real thing!
Seriously, I would buy a pair for sure! I wish I had birds that could sew for me.
That would be nice, her step sisters were so ugly
They were, with warts all over their faces
They had such big feet also, Cinderella was so pretty
I know, it was sad how she was treated
It was, I am glad she got to live happily ever after
with all of her animal friends !
That was such a cute part of the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the new Beauty and the Beast!
Wasn't it amazing??
Yes, I wanted to sing along the whole time.
I know, the music was even better than the cartoon.
The costumes really blew me away.
Yeah, Belle looked so beautiful at the end!
My kids got a little scared during the fight scene.
Wasn't it intense? I cried.
I am definitely going to buy the DVD.
Me, too. I'm sure we will play it on repeat!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Pixar still working with Disney? I haven't seen much from them in a while.
They're doing Cars 3, they're still together.
They're still on that?
Yep.
They also did Coco.
What's Coco?
The one about the Mexican kid and the guitar.
You mean the one with the kids who grow up and become romantic rivals and something about the Day of the Dead?
No, you're thinking of Book of Life. That wasn't Disney.
Ah, right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch Disney movies as a child?
Yes, I used to watch "The Wonderful World of Disney" on tv.
So did I!  I remember it came on Sunday nights right after "Wild Kingdom."
I used to get excited when the graphic of Cinderella's castle popped up with Tinkerbell flying around.  You knew something fun was about to happen.
Yes, me too.  What were some of your favorites?
Well, "Cinderella", of course, and some of the live action movies like "Escape to Witch Mountain."  How about you?
I loved "Cinderella" too, and I remember seeing "Escape to Witch Mountain" at the theater.  What was the first Disney movie you saw at the theater?
I think maybe it was "The Rescuers."  It's hard to remember that far back.  Which was the first you saw?
I think it was "Alice in Wonderland."  I remember going after dance practice, and we were a bit late and missed the first part.  But that was back when you could stay for the second showing, so we stayed and watched again.
That sounds fun.  What great memories.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I liked how the Princess and the Frog was drawn like most of the other Disney princess movies.
I agree. I am not a big fan of computer animated movies.
I am a fan of both, but I just appreciated how authentic the design felt.
Totally, and it had been so long since a Disney movie was animated like that.
I think it had been since Home on the Range came out.
Wow. That movie came out so long ago.
I know. It is such an underrated Disney film, too.
I agree. I loved the voicework by Roseanne Barr.
I did as well. She has such an expressive voice.
Disney movies always have the best voice acting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Fantasia at an animation festival.
Cool.  When was it released?
1940.
Cool.  Who was the conductor?
Leopold Stokowski.
Neat.  What was your favorite piece?
The Rite of Spring.
Neat.  I liked the one with Mickey Mouse.  What piece was that?
The Sorcerer's Apprentice, by Dukas.
Right.  A marvelous animated movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Cars?
yes, I loved the first one.
Lightning McQueen, what a great name for a car character.
Yes, it was very novel. All the characters.
Did you know that Paul Newman was the voice of the old champ in Radiator Springs?
Really? I didn't know that.
Yes, it was one of his last movies.
yeah, he was in a few driving movies back in the day.
I don't recall. I just thought he did a great job in Cars.
Yes, I liked Tator as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hope Disney has a new movie coming out soon. I'm sick of watching Moana with my little one.
I don't know when their next film comes out but I know they just finished filming a Mary Poppins reboot.
Who is starring in that?
Emily Blunt is Mary Poppins and Lin-Manuel Miranda is playing Bert
The guy from Hamilton? That should be great!
I think so too! I also read that he is going to be Sebastian the crab in the live action Little Mermaid remake.
They must be out of ideas since they are remaking everything.
Probably so. I know they are doing a remake of the Lion King that way too.
That's such a classic! I don't know why they would bother remaking it.
I guess nostalgia makes big bucks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know Mary Poppins?
I know it well.
Yeah, that movie was so scary as a kid.
That seems to be a common theme with Disney offerings.
Right? The whole telekinetic thing was a bit much.
It was. But Julie Andrews was charming.
As she always is, but I wouldn't want to defy her.
No Sir. I never got the purpose of the chimney sweep.
Well, he was dirty but happy. I think that was a thing back then.
Right. Back when chimney sweeping was still an actual profession!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the new Jungle Book?
I loved it, and I really loved Christopher Walken as King Louie.
Seems like he was born to play that part. I thought it was a great movie.
I saw the new Tarzan but I didn't really like it.
It definitely could have used a little more action. I caught myself falling asleep.
I did like the cartoon version, especially since Phil Collins did the score.
Right that was a good version of Tarzan. I loved the Princess and the Frog.
I liked it and I think it was good that they let an African American girl play a princess.
My daughter has the doll, Tiana is her name. She carries a fairy tale book and a little frog.
Oh that's so cute! My daughter has a bunch of Disney princess dolls too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Disney movie is Aladdin.  What is your opinion of that movie?
I can't believe the sultan was making his 16 year old daughter get married.
A lot of Disney movies are like that though.  What did you think of the songs?
A Whole New World is my favorite song.  I love it when Jasmine and Aladdin sing.
I really like that song but my favorite song is Prince Ali.
That is a really good song too.  Robin Williams made a really good genie.
Yes, he was a really good genie.  My favorite character is Abu.
Who doesn't like a monkey they are mischievous and funny?!
That is true my favorite part of the movie is when Carpet keeps playing tricks on Abu and scares him.
Carpet is the true in this movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I still think they are the bees knees
Who
Disney
i like them
Their movies are the tops
The old ones are better
true
but the new ones arent all bad
Yeah they are far from it
pretty much
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched Finding Dory last week.
Is that the second Finding Nemo movie?
Yes, about Dory's childhood and why she is like she is.
So it explains her life?
Yes. It's a pretty cute movie.
I love Nemo.
Me too. His father Marlin is a funny guy too.
Yes, the three characters go together good.
Keeps you wanting to watch.
Even an adult likes Nemo movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Emperor's New Groove?
Yes. I love that movie.
Me too. It's really funny.
I loved David Spade as the Emperor.
He was perfect for it. So was John Goodman as Pacha.
I liked his wife too. That one actress did her voice.
Oh yeah Wendie Malick. I like her.
I liked Kronk the best though. He cracked me up.
Patrick Warburton did the voice for Kronk right?
Yeah that's him. He is really great. I like his voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is it you like about Disney movies? Is there anything specific you can think of?
Disney films always have fun storylines, and always leave you feeling great at the end.
That's true. I can't think of a single Disney movie with a sad ending. Can you?
I will say that Big Red was sad, honestly. I watched that as a child and will never forget how I cried.
I hadn't thought of that movie. That one's an oldie.
Yes, but when a movie brings you to tears, especially as a child, you tend to remember it.
That's true. Bambi did that to me. His poor mother...well, we know what happened to her.
Yes, now we are on the same page. But in general, Disney movies are fantastic and a brand I trust.
Well thank you for your honest response. I appreciate it.
You are most welcome. Disney's Pixar movies are my favorites though. I love the 3D animations the most!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what, I think Cinderella is massively overrated.
Me too, but everyone seems to love it.
It's so derivative and almost anti-feminist.
Yeah you're so right. I always hated how Cinderella's life was doomed until the handsome prince whisked her away.
Also what's with the ugly people being bad. That's giving a terrible message to kids.
The ugly people?
Yeah, Cinderella's ugly stepsisters were horrible to her.
Her wicked stepmother was no spring chicken either.
That being said though, how pretty was her ball gown!
Oh so pretty indeed, but glass slippers would have been a nightmare to wear.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello buddy, I was watching tarzan movie this morning
hey, really? me too!
What was your favorite part of the movie?
I really enjoyed when Ted asked Tarzan to get an elephant hair
It was crazy. I couldn't believe he actually went for it!.
Crazy, no?. Another scene that I really loved was when Tarzan saved Kerchak by killing the jaguar.
Oh, I really loved it as well. Tarzan was so brave!
Definitively!. I think after that, Kerchak realized that Tarzan was part of their family.
I agree with you. It is a beautiful message delivered by the movie.
Yes, it is.We need to respect and love each other no matter how different we are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Disney bought the rights to Anastasia?
No, I did not. I thought that was already a Disney movie.
A lot of people, my self included, thought the same thing but apparently not.
Hey! Doesn't that mean she's officially a Disney Princess?
I suppose you're technically right. I mean, I don't see why not.
I wonder if they'll give her a live action movie like all these other classics getting remakes lately.
Well... actually... they announced the live action remake at the same time of purchase.
I wonder who they'll get to play the role of Anastia.
I wouldn't mind seeing Emma Stone to be perfectly honest.
I could see that or possibly Karen Gillan even if her contract would even allow her to. I don't think it'd be a problem her working on Guardians of the Galaxy and another Disney project.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw that new Disney movie, Moana.
Is that the one with Dwayne Johnson?
Yea. He's a really good voice actor.
Nice. So how was the movie?
Really good! It's about a chieftain’s daughter who wants to venture out into the sea which is against their customs.
Who does The Rock play.
A demigod named Maui. His song is actually my favorite.
I'll have to check it out. Is it anything like the little mermaid?
No, but the Directors are Ron Clements and John Musker. The same ones who directed The Little Mermaid.
Wow, I'll definitely have to watch it now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Pinocchio?
Yes, but not since I was a kid.
What do you remember about it?
I remember how Pinocchio was a wooden puppet who was made real.
Well of course, what else?
When he would tell a lie his nose would grow.
Do you remember pleasure island?
Yes, those poor kids turned into donkeys.
I liked the part inside the whale, what about you?
The whale was scary, I liked the blue fairy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am a huge fan of Disney movies.  How about yourself?
Yes me too!  The new movies are good, but I am fond of the classics.
What is your favorite classic Disney movie?
I really love Bambi.  It is a great movie.
Oh yes that is a classic. Thumper was a great character!
Do you have a favorite Disney movie of any era?
That is a tough question there are so many good ones. I'd say Lion King is my favorite.
Great choice, one of the best for sure!
It really was a great movie, like many that Disney has made.
They sure do make good ones.  I can't wait for the next Frozen!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the live-action Beauty and the Beast movie?
I don't know, I think I like the animated one better.
Really? I thought the live-action one was pretty good.
It just felt like it was copying the animated movie. It had all the same songs.
They're great songs, though!
They are! But if you want to hear "Tale as Old as Time," why not just watch the animated movie?
I thought Emma Watson was great as Belle.
She was pretty good. But I thought the special effects looked kind of weird.
Well, I like them both.
The live-action one wasn't bad. But the animated one is a true classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the Walt Disney movie called Bambi?
Yes, vaguely though. What was it about again?
It was about a young deer growing up in the forest. His name was Bambi.
Oh yes, I think I remember now. Didn't his mother die at the end of the movie?
Yes, I believe that's what happened in the movie. I do remember the young rabbit Thumper.
Thumper was a interesting character. Wasn't he Bambi's best friend or something?
I do believe they were best friends in the movie. They were pretty much in all the scenes.
Yes. Those types of movies would teach so much to young children right now.
Tell me about it. I remembered when Bambi first learned to speak. It was so sweet seeing him try to say birds..."B-burr".
Thumper was such a good friend to him, teaching him how to speak.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched a Disney movie on a projection screen?
No, why?
I watched Frozen on it
Did it look different?
No not at all , just bigger.
Well I figure its an animation film.
Yeah so it doesnt really make a difference.
I love the singing in that movie.
I think the actors did a great job.
I cant wait to see if they do another one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever happen to see the movie Dumbo, which had been made in 1941 by Walt Disney!
Dumbo, yes i have seen that movie few years ago.
Dumbo was a baby elephant, who was growing up with a circus performing team.
Yes i remember that, Dumbo had quite a larger ears than other elephants right?
Yes thats right, all the time he was thinking its really hard to manage his larger ears.
Yeah i was also wondering why he has such a larger ears when i was watching the movie for the first time.
Everyone thinks the same i guess, his larger ears was noticable all through the movie.
And but it has really inspiring climax, it is such a beautiful story told in a brilliant way!
You are right, Have you seen it till the end?
Yes i did, and it gave me goose bumps when the baby Elephant flew using his larger ears as wings!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't get that song "Let it Go" out of my head, and the movie Frozen came out years ago!
Maybe by the time the new one comes out you will have a new song in your head!
I wasn't even a big fan of the movie.  It definitely wasn't my favorite Disney movie.
It wasn't my favorite, but I did not see the plot twist with Hans coming.
I totally thought he was a good guy the whole time!  I loved Kristoff though so I'm not mad.
Olaf was pretty cute too.  His song made me crack up.
He had some of the best lines in the movie!
I did love the song with the rock trolls though, it was pretty cute.
That scene was great!  But I would feel totally awkward if that was me.
But it was totally funny. And super catchy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey did you watch the new finding nemo movie?
no i didnt even know a new one came out
yeah it was called finding dory
oh, wow that sounds crazy awesome
Yeah i didnt get a chance to catch it but i was just glad to hear a sequel had come out
good point, didnt the first one come out a while back?
yeah it did, so most of the people who watched it were probably people in their twenties
that sounds about right, the first one was so good
yeah, i liked nemo and how much he tried despite his small fin
he was surely a trooper, i wonder if the new one lived up to the hype.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like some of the Disney movies lately are hit or miss. What about you?
I feel like they are as well.
What are some of your favorite Disney movies? I prefer Tangled and Big Hero 6 as well as Wreck-It Ralph over Frozen.
I would have to say those are my favorite as well. Frozen was just too generic.
Did you enjoy the live action Beauty and The Beast Disney movie?
I liked it but I felt like there were some aspects that were better in the animated version of Beauty and The Beast.
What about Disney's Cinderella Live Action?
That one was alright. Cinderella was never my favorite fairy tale though.
I found the Malificent movie though to be a bit refreshing.
I did enjoy that movie a lot although it would be nice to see Maleficent get a romantic true love.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the newer stuff they made
What their movies
Yeah their movies
Which one you like
I love tangled
Thats a decent movie
It is adorable
I kinda agree
You better
Well i do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Johnny Depp must really love playing Captain Jack Sparrow in The Pirates of the Caribbean movies.
Well, I'm sure he does- hit movies, more fame, more money...
No, I mean he must really enjoy the character- he turned up in April at Disneyland at the Pirates of the Caribbean ride dressed up as his character.
What was he doing there? Did Disney ask him to do a promo for the new movie or something?
No, apparently he just wanted to surprise his fans.
I bet there were some really thrilled fans at the ride when they saw him!
There were dozens of screaming fans. He was interacting with them, and quoting lines from the movies, and had his sword.
Can you imagine how shocked you would be? At first they probably thought it was just a celebrity double.
The fans were quoted as being shocked and surprised, and said he acted just like his movie character.
That would really get people excited. His character is so popular. And having him just pop up out of nowhere must have been amazing for those fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Am I right in thinking that Mulan is the only Disney movie set in East Asia?
I think so. Why?
It just seems like a missed opportunity. They've gone to the Europe well a lot, but almost never to other parts of the world.
The Lion King and Tarzan took place in Africa?
Yeah, and the Jungle Book was in India.
And The Emperor's New Clothes was Peru.
So I guess they do go to other countries sometimes.
They do.
I'd still like to see more new settings though! I think it could be exciting.
I wouldn't mind it at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Goofy sort of comes of as an outcast in my opinion which makes him worse than Donald.
How does that make sense
It makes plenty of sense
Because he is the only tall one?
Well their is that
That is not a reason to say he is worse
But it can be
Obvious you got no humor taste
I do too
Does not
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw on the cover of Entertainment Weekly that Emily Blunt is the new Mary Poppins.
I know, I can't wait to see it.
I was totally in love with the original.
Oh, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke dancing and singing. I adore them!
I heard they wanted Julie Andrews to do a cameo in the new movie but she said no.
Yes, she wanted it to be Emily Blunt's time to shine, She's so sweet that way.
I wonder if Dick Van Dyke will show up in a cameo?
I hope so, that would be great.
And he can still dance, I saw him on TV last month.
He's the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Disney movie is your favorite?
My all-time favorite is definitely Beauty and the Beast!
I love that one too! The music is so wonderful!
I love the story, what is your favorite song from it?
Oh, that's hard to choose. I think it would be Angela Lansbury singing the main song.
ME TOO, I love that!!!
Do you like the new version that came out?
No, I absolutely hate it!!
Me too, I was so disappointed.
Yeah, I had high hopes for it but it was a big let down.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite classic disney movie?
I really love aladdin
Me too
The genie is my favorite part
I love the genie
He is so fun
I really love jasmines tiger
Raj is adorable
Great movie
One of the best
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Haunted Mansion was on HBO today.
Oh man, what did you think?
It's hard to imagine Disney screwing it up more.
I know right?  Why did they take all the fun out of it?
It wasn't that it wasn't fun, I just thought it should have been darker.
You mean like super-creepy?
Yeah, kind of like they should have made it PG-13 and not as campy.
I could see that.
I hope they remake it that way and make it tons better.
I would pay $10 in a theater to see it for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched tangled
Did you like it?
Yes it was so good
I figured Flynn Rider would have realized she was the lost princess
Me too
He was too selfish i guess
But he did end up being a good guy
Yes thats true
I was happy when she went home
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?
The Disney cartoon?  Yeah.
Do you know how old that cartoon was?
Not really, but I know it was older than my parents.
Yeah, it blew me away that it was that old.
I think they probably digitally fixed a lot of things by the time you watched it.
I guess, because it looked old, but not that old.
Yeah, it's amazing what editting can do.
Yeah, I guess so.
A ton of old movies use the same methods.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just love the Little Mermaid, it's my favorite Disney movie!
Me too!
Growing up I always wanted to be Ariel and find my Prince Eric.
I just wanted to have a dad that could control the weather!
Haha that would have been a good trait to have, especially on those days when a snow day could have really come in handy!
When I was a kid, I had a Sebastian stuffed animal that I carried everywhere. I could never decide whether he was a crab or a lobster though!
I think he was a lobster. I had a Ariel barbie doll that I took with me to the pool every summer.
The one with the clip on tail?
That's the one! She swam with me and we sang "Part of Your World," my mom thought it was hilarious!
I had the same doll! I always pretended I was diving in the shipwreck like she did at the beginning of the movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did you think of Frozen?
I thought it was all right.
Just all right? What didn't you like about it?
Well, it didn't make sense to me.
What didn't make sense?
Well, a few things actually.
Oh? Like what?
Well, for one, why would anyone try selling ice in a kingdom that's made of ice?!
Haha, you goof! Did you really enjoy the movie or not?
Oh, I enjoyed it well enough. Especially the singing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Moana for the first time. Have you seen it?
No, I missed it in the movies and haven't seen it on Netflix yet.
You're missing out! You should totally watch it.
That's what I've heard.  What did you love about it?
It was so cute and funny!  My favorite song was "You're welcome"?
I've heard that song, I didn't realize it was from Moana!
Yeah!  It really has some great songs in it!
Excellent!  Did it have a good side-kick?
Yes!  Hey-Hey the chicken!  I don't want to give it all away, so you should see it!
Ok, I will!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Disney movies?
Of course!  Who doesn't like Disney movies?
Which Disney movie is your favorite?
Fox and the Hound is probably my favorite.
Which character in that movie was your favorite?
I liked Copper the best.
What is your next favorite Disney movie?
There's so many good ones it's hard to choose just one but I also liked The Jungle Book.
Why do you like The Jungle Book?
The music is great!  There's a song about "being like you" that still gets stuck in my head.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Disney's evil movie characters?
I think most of them are brilliant!
How so? What makes them brilliant?
It seems like Disney has a way of devoloping these characters so you literally hate them and root for the good guys.
That's true. What specific characters come to mind when you think of Disney villains?
Cruella De Vil, Ursula, Gaston, Captain Hook, not to mention all of the evil queens!
Did any specific villains scare you when you were little?
The Big Bad Wolf was pretty creepy to be honest. Captain Hook was pretty scary too.
Any other Disney villains you can think of?
I think Randall Boggs from Monsters was pretty awesome, honestly! Reminds me of someone I know!
XXXXXXXXXXX
YO
Ello
I am bored wanna come by
Sure what time
in like an hour
Sounds good
Want to watch some movies
Sounds fun
We can watch all the toy stories
Ok sounds good
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Disney is adapting Jack and the Beanstalk?
Oh, I loved that story as a kid!
I did too! I think it's a good choice.
Do you know anything else about the movie?
It's going to be called "Gigantic."
Hmm. Sounds like it'll be a lot about the giant.
The giant living in the clouds was always such a weird part of that story to me.
Yeah, it's weird but you have to take stories like that with a grain of salt.
Anyway, it comes out in 2020, so we've got a while to wait.
I'll be excited when it comes out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many animated Disney movies are there?
Well, it depends on how you classify them. All animated movies, only classics, Pixar included? That's not an easy question!
Okay, I will narrow it down. Animated Disney classics.
I think there are around 30.
It seems like there are more.
Well, for example, I don't think Princess and the Frog is considered a Disney classic.
Who even decides that?
I have no idea!
Was Snow White the first though.
Yes it was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your favorite songs from Disney movies.
I liked You've Got a Friend in Me.
My favorite is A Whole New World
The music is not overdone most of the time
It adds emotion and helps you relate to the characters
All of the characters are great singers
Aladdin and Jasmine are good ones.
So was Ariel
Maybe it's a princess thing
Most of them are love songs
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot wait for them to make the live action version of Aladdin. It is my favorite Disney movie.
I am a little scared because of director.  He isn't really known for kids movies.
I can't wait to see who they cast in the movie, they are kind of tricky roles to fill.
I heard that Will Smith might be the genie.  I'm not sure how I feel about that yet.
Robin Williams will be hard to replace, his performance was iconic.
I head that they weren't even sure about keeping the songs in it yet.
What?! They have to keep the songs in it, it wouldnt be the same.
And I wonder how they will do Iago, he was pretty important.
Oh yeah, I forgot about Abu!  They will probably have to use some CGI.
It wasn't too bad in Beauty and the Beast, maybe they will do a nice job in Aladdin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so sad that Robin Williams died.
Yeah, him playing the Genie in Aladdin was a big part of my childhood.
That was the perfect character for him. He was really larger than life.
I still have all the songs memorized.
Should we do an Aladdin movie night.
Sure! I have a copy. I even have the sequels.
There are sequels?
Yeah, a couple of them.
Are they any good?
I mean, not really but they're watchable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like older or newer Disney movies?
I am a fan of older movies.
Me too.
I like the Lion King.
That is a great movie.
I watched it quite a bit as a young kid.
I think the movies from that time were better than what they make today.
They make some good stuff today but I really liked the older ones.
Lion King teaches some great values.
Yes it does.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Beauty and the Beast?
I saw the cartoon version
It was a good one
Did you feel sorry for the beast?
I thought that it was a little harsh of the wizard
If there was a real life beast, he would need to stay hidden
I'm sure he was lonely
I hope he was not made to live like a beast for long.
He was able to save Belle's life because of being the best
I think a gun would have scared them away
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know mary poppins was a disney movie?
I didnt realize that
Yea it is, and hands down the best disney movie ever
Definitely, i love it
I still have the songs stuck in my head
Me too
I liked that scene where they jumped into the  street art
Me too, i also liked the chimey sweep song
That one was fun
The whole movie is great
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
Cinderella
Oh, that's an oldie!
But a goodie!
I'll agree to that
Yea, it's kinda an analogy for some people's lives
I can see that
Like how she goes from having no hope to getting super lucky
I'm following you
I wish I could end up like her!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I went to see Moana yesterday.
Really, how was it.
It was really good.
Better than Frozen?
No, not that good.
Who was your favorite character?
Moana because she was a strong and independent girl.
Sounds like a good role model.
She was, she stood up for herself and her beliefs.
Kids need to learn that today!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if Pocahontas won any Academy Awards.
It won two of them.
For what?
One for original comedy/musical score and one for best song.
Which song?
Colors of the Wind.
Who sang it in the movie?
Pocahontas.
Do you know what year that was?
1995.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Disney has some amazing animated films and I think Aladdin is definitely no exception.
I absolutely agree with that. I think it falls into that category of helping launch Disney.
Did you remember if you went and saw it in the theater?
I do and in fact, my family and I went to see it several times. I think it's the movie I've seen the most times at the theater ever.
Having re-watched it not too long ago, I also think the animation holds up very well.
It definitely does, as well as the voice acting.
Absolutely agree. The late Robin Williams stole the show, however.
I think the Genie was the most popular character for a lot of people, especially the kids.
To this day, it's probably one of my top three favorite Disney movies.
It's up there for me, as well. Aladdin is a classic and there is no denying that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know there is a new Incredibles movie coming out?
Yes actually I did, I think its coming out next year.
Yeah I heard it was coming 2018 as well.
I liked the previous movie I always wondered why they didnt make a sequel for that one.
Yeah I know it was a good movie.
Yes it was, it was a good movie with great visuals.
I liked the superpowers and that they are all a family of super heroes.
I wonder who the new villain will be.
Yeah, I wonder that as well. I think that its going to be an epic movie
Are there any previews available?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love disney movies
What is yoir favorite disney movie of all time?
Aladdin
That was a good one
What about you?
Beauty and the Beast
That one was good too
So goo, i loved watching them fall in love
And then she got a handsome prince
Exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Hmmm, do Pixar movies count?
Well they are Disney so yea.
Then Up was my favorite movie.
Who was your favorite character?
The dog, I loved him so much.
Yea, he was really funny, didn't he get distracted all the time?
Yea, he would always get distracted by squirrels hahaha.
Didn't that movie start out so sad?
Yea, I cried, I think everyone did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When was the last time you watched a classic Disney movie?
Probably a year or two ago I watched Fantasia with my little cousins.
I just recently re-watched Snow White and I miss that style of animation so much.
Oh, I know the colors and everything.
Can you imagine drawing all those dwarves over and over like that?
Not at all, but that's what made those movies special, all the hard work.
Very true, if only they still did animations like that.
Imagine if Frozen was animated by hand.
Ahhh it could be beautiful, don't make my heart think like that.
Only in our dreams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Disney movie?
When I was younger it was the Little Mermaid but now I really like Beauty and the Beast.
It's always been The Lion King for me. I watched it over and over when I was little.
That's definitely one of the best that's ever been made. But I love the Disney Princesses.
Nala is not enough of a princess for you?
You know what I mean, she's not considered a princess like Ariel or Belle.
Yeah, I know. I'm sure we can at least agree that we miss hand drawn Disney?
Absolutely. Those were the good old days.
Wait, I forgot about the amazingness of Frozen and Moana.
Oh yeah. Okay it's all great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My sister just got a copy of the Aristocats.
I remember that movie, the cats with the accents.
Yeah, that one. I used to love that movie.
Me too! When I was young I'd sing all the cat songs.
What's the name of the song where all the cats are singing together in the house?
When they're having their piano lessons?
No, it's kinda jazzy. They meet with other cats to sing.
Is it towards the end of the movie?
Yeah, I think it is.
Hmmm, Everybody wants to be a cat, right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw the Disney Cinderella movie last night.
Cool.  When was that made?
It was released in 1950.
I heard Disney was in trouble then.
$4m in debt.  The movie reversed its fortunes.
Cool.  What was the great song in that movie?
"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"
Right.  Great fun.
I loved Jaq and Gus.
The mice!  They were great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
i really dont like disney movies
why? i think they are fun!
it is because of all the singing
yeah you are right
but my kids really likes them!
maybe you grown bored about all that stuff
i dont think so, when i was a kid i didnt watch any of them
you never watched a disney movie when you were a kid?
nope
poor you
XXXXXXXXXXX
What should I rent tonight?
Zootopia!
But it's a kid's movie.
I know, but it's really good.
I want something that isn't a cartoon. I'm not a baby.
No, trust me. It's about race and stereotypes. It's really a great movie.
I don't know.
Jason Bateman is so funny. It's really great.
Maybe.
Watch it! I'll rent your next movie for you if you don't like this one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is the movie about  Airplanes a sequel to cars
I dont think they are
Well i was just wondering
why
Well i want to watch all those movies
They are decent
I love them
Not my thing
Why not
Dont click with me i guess
XXXXXXXXXXX
Their super old stuff was bad though
How was it bad
The animation was poor for one
That makes no sense
It was it looked bad
For the time it was great
But now it is not
Gotta judge it on the relative tech
Makes no sense
It makes perfect sense
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Bambi is coming out on Blu Ray?
Yes I heard that today actually.
I saw an interview with the men who had played Thumper and Bambi not that long ago.
Really? That is cool. What did they say?
They were only 4 and 5 when they did the film and it took 3 years for them to make it.
Wow that is a long time.
Yes they had to do voice work every once in a while whenever changes were made.
Well then it is good that they were so young as their voices could not have changed much.
Yes , they also said that kids still mail them pictures of Bambi and Thumper.
Wow, that is really sweet. Must make them feel so great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie the Princess Diaries?
With Anne Hathaway?
Yeah!
I love that movie! One of my favorites!
Me too! Julie Andrews was great in that movie as well.
I totally agree.
Did you see the second one?
No I did not.
That is unfortunate, because it is great.
I will make a note to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of The Emperor's New Groove?
I like it a lot. It's funny with some characters that become endearing.
I like the dialogue between Kronk and Yzma.
The banter of Yzma and Kronk as well as Kuzco and Pacha is hilarious.
My favorite part is the scene at the restaurant where they keep almost running into Kronk and Yzma.
Yeah that part made me laugh a lot.
What did you think of the squirrel?
The squirrel in that movie was cute and it was funny how he bonded with Kronk.
Did you ever see the sequel Kronk's New Groove?
I did and it was pretty good but Emperor's New Groove was better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Sleeping Beauty?
Yes, the animation is beautiful.
It might be the most beautiful Disney film.
That is up for debate. Snow White is pretty gorgeous too.
Yeah, I even liked when it got more rough with 101 Dalmatians.
Yeah, that looked a lot different than the rest.
But, do you think Sleeping Beauty is the best Disney movie?
Yes, I do. It is amazing.
Was that made before Snow White?
No, after.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some Disney movies that are based on books? I'm writing an essay about adaptation.
That sounds like a good essay. Hmm. Let me think.
I know The Little Mermaid and Snow White are based on Fairy Tales, that sort of counts.
Isn't The Hunchback of Notre Dame a Victor Hugo novel?
Oh yeah! And One Hundred and One Dalmatians is based on a children's novel too.
It seems like there are a lot of them after all.
Is The Hunchback of Notre Dame anything like the movie.
I bet it's a lot darker. Disney usually makes things happier.
Well, they are children's movies after all.
I guess so. They have to make them kid friendly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey what did you think of toy story?
oh that was a great movie, a disney classic
i agree who did you like the best in the movie
i would have to say buzz
buzz is cool but i think woody is the best
woody isnt bad but buzz's lines were so cool
yeah you have a point, they were very memorable
exactly, to infinity and beyond
i loved that one, he said it so cool too
yeah thats what im saying. buzz lightyear, everyone loves him
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am liking the new age of them
Who
Disney
Their new movies?
Yeah their new movies
I think they are improving
Improving?
Nothing can touch the very start
Like 30s and 40s
Yeah
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Aladdin.
Me too. The songs are great.
The magic carpet ride is catchy.
It was inspirational.
What was?
Seeing the young man rise to success for the princess.
Her name was Jasmine right?
Yes, she had a great voice.
The genie was hilarious.
Robin Williams did a great job.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about disney movies
Okay sounds awesome
Have you seen another cinderella story?
The one with selena gomez right?
Yes what was your favorite part?
When she was dancing behind the two way mirror
That was good
What about you
When he was helping her with her chores
I loved that part
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you or your kids seen the Disney movie Finding Nemo?
Sure we have. Me and the kids watch it all the time.
It's a classic in our house. We love to watch all our favorite characters.
We do, too. Did you know that Ellen Degeneres was the voice of Dory?
Yes, I knew that. She did a great job didn't she. Dory was a great character.
You know who was my favorite character? It was Crush the sea turtle.
I know, right? He had like a cool surfer dude personality. I loved it.
So did I. All the animation in the film was really neat. Especially when they showed the schools of fish.
I think I'm going to buy the kids the sequel, Finding Dory. I'm sure they will love it.
Yeah, I think it will probably do as well as the original Finding Nemo did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite sidekick in The Little Mermaid, Flounder or Sebastian?
I like Flounder because it's so cute how anxious he is.
Yeah. It seems like Sebastian is anxious in his own way as well.
I agree. He was overbearing, but his heart was in the right place.
I love when he sings the song Under the Sea to convince Ariel about how great the ocean is.
That is the best song in the movie.
I agree. I can't even remember any of the other ones.
Me either. Didn't Ursula sing a song sometime?
Hm. Now that you say that it does ring a bell.
Oh, I remember now. It was Poor Unfortunate Souls.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movie is your favorite?
I love Mary poppins.
Oh me too it is a fantastic movie.
Julie Andrews was amazing in it.
I agree her voice was so good.
What do you think about the remake.
With Emily blunt?
Yes.
Seems interesting.
I concur but I think it is rather odd they are remaking it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the scene in beauty and the beast where Gaston exiles her father
No I didn't think that was right. He was very egotistical
I like the song kiss the girl from the little mermaid. What do you think
It was very romantic indeed
I like Disney pixar. The graphics are awesome
I agree. They really did something with that
Who is your favorite Disney princess
I fell I  love with repunzel
How many dwarfs are in snow white
There are seven dwarfs in snow white
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Disney Pixar movie by far has to be the Toy Story series.
Yes, these movies always seem to make me cry.
I cried during the end of Toy Story 3, Andy is all grown up.
When Andy gave Woody to the girl it was like a full circle experience.
Do you think Andy will get the toys back for his own kids?
It would be nice to see Andy get married and have the toys be in his kids lives.
Disney might be making that the next movie.
Yes but what if Andy has a daugher?
I think Andy's daughter would also play with the toys.
Maybe Woody and Bo-Peep would have a renunion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which one of the Disney classic films you like the most?
I don't really have a favorite.  But if I had to pick, it would be Peter Pan.
Peter Pan is a nice classic.  Isn't that's with the lost boys?
Yes, and Wendy and her little brothers too.
I like the dog in the movie. He was funny.
I think the dog was a she and was the babysitter.
Yes, the dog was the nurse-maid and followed them around everywhere.
But the dog didn't go to the land of the lost boys with them.
How many lost boys were on the island?
Not sure, I think there was about 12 or 13 of them around that island.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was the movie "Maleficent" about "Sleeping Beauty"
Well in a roundabout way.
What do you mean?
Well it is told from the perspective of the evil fairy.
Oh and she is named Maleficent.
Right - the character played by Angelina Jolie.
She is pretty - but a little scary looking in that movie.
Yes the horns were pretty crazy looking.
But she is a great actress, she probably did a good job.
Oh yes.  She was great in that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have loved Disney movies all my life.  I think my favorite is Tangled.
Why do you like that on, in particular?
I don't know for sure.  It makes me laugh, and the songs are awesome.
That's true.  Isn't the mother who keeps Rapunzel in the tower absolutely awesome?
She really is.  She had me scared even though she was animated.
My favorite part is when Rapunzel is singing in the bar.  All those bar guys are hilarious!
I like that part too, but I especially love the ending when she founds out who she really is.
That is really neat.  What about the part with all those lanterns?
I totally forgot about those.  They are magical and perfectly Disney.
Disney really has a way of getting to my heart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the movie The Jungle Book which was released last year.
Absolutely ! I rarely miss any such movies based on animals and people living in jungles.
I really liked the kid who portrayed the role of Mowgli. I think, he acted really well !
Oh yes, he sure did. But, I liked the animations and animals in the movies as well, especially his wolf mother.
It's amazing how they keep re-inventing an old movie. I think it is inspired by their first release in 1967.
Sure it was. I liked that one as well. I think it was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman.
By the way, it was a super-hit then and it is a super hit now.
Oh yes ! I think the new one has a business of more than 990 million dollars. Wow, almost a billion.
I am surely looking forward to their next movie on such a topic.
Well, don't have to high hopes. They have a tendency of not working on a similar movie for very long time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
101 Dalmations was a good movie
I know as a dog lover it made me mad
Corella was a scary lady who would want to skin dogs
I know, who comes up with that?
Especially in a kid movie, a bad lady who skins dogs alive.
who would wear a dog fur coat anyway?
just a disturbed person obviously
why would she need so many dog skins to make a coat/
i HAVE NO IDEA! WHAT A CRAZY PERSON
after that movie I heard people wanted that type of dog and demand went up for them
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Ratatouille?
Is that the one with the rat who wants to be a Chef?
Yes, it takes place in Paris.
I vaguely remember it. What I do remember is a lot of cooking.
His lifelong dream was to cook in Gusteau's kitchen.
What was his name again?
Remy.
Isn't Linguini, Gusteau's son?
Skinner had the papers that proved it in his office.
That's where Remy found them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hear you're expecting! Is it a boy or girl?
A boy! We're naming him Sebastian.
I'm sensing a pattern. First Ariel, now Sebastian?
Well Flounder isn't exactly a good name for a little boy.
Or Ursula for a girl!
If I had twins I could have named them Flotsam and Jetsam.
Classic! And let me guess you're doing an " Under the Sea" theme for the nursery.
The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake.
You dream about going up there but that is a big mistake.
Both my children will be avid Little Mermaid fans and they will learn to love their namesakes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you enjoy The Little Mermaid?
Of course. It was spectacular.
When did it come out?
That came out in the late 80's. 1989.
I remember seeing it as a kid.
There is nothing like it. The love story is so sweet.
I like the part when Ariel loses her voice and is just do happy to be with her loved one.
Yes and then they go on that date.
What is that song that plays on the date scene?
I think it is called "Kiss the Girl."
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder how Disney consistently comes up with great new movies?
Well, a lot of Disney movies are based on old fairy tales and legends.
I knew that about the older movies, but some of the newer ones?
Yes. For instance, Frozen was based on a Hans Christian Andersen story.
Really? I had no idea about that.
Yes, and Moana was based on a Hawaiian Legend.
I wonder what new ones they will adapt?
I don't know. I do hope there are more Pixar collaborations.
Yes. Those my favorites.
Me, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
I think Mulan would take the cake.
Ewww, why?
I just think they did a great job showing gender inequality in the army.
Yea, the Chinese army back in the day!
Yea, but then they showed how no matter what gender you are, you can contribute and make a difference.
Hmmm, I never thought of it like that.
I think Mulan had more guts than any of the men out there.
How can you possibly say that?
She was willing to sacrifice everything to take her fathers place in the army, that is called fortitude.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the live action Beauty and the Beast movie?
I saw it on opening weekend.
What did you think of it?
I loved it. I thought Disney did a great job.
Who was your favorite character?
I really liked Le Fou.
Did you know that it hit the #10 spot in all time box office gross?
I had no idea.
Do you think they may do a sequel?
It's a possibility.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you think Emma Watson was a good choice to play Belle?
For sure. She was even born in France!
Wait, she was?
Yeah, she just moved to England when she was young.
Wow. Wait, why does it matter that she's French?
Because Belle is French!
Wait, really?
Yeah. Belle means "beautiful" in French.
Wow, I had no idea. Thanks.
You're welcome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey i just got done watching peter pan
oh i remember that movie, why did you just watch it?
i was bored and had never seen it before
oh really? what did you think?
it was good, it was cool how they flew through the sky
yeah that was a good scene, i liked captain hook
but he was the bad guy how could you?
true but he was very interesting and he had a hook for an arm
i guess that is pretty cool
yeah it is, but the bad guys never prevail in the end
XXXXXXXXXXX
Aladdin was my favorite movie as a kid
did you ever wish you found a magic lamp?
all of the time, I would always think of my three wishes
I know, but the genie could be tricky
Yes, you had to word what you wanted just right!
I also thought a magic carpet would be cool
I used to pretend that our area rug was magic and I could fly
That movie was full of really neat things
It was the genie was kind of scary though
yeah he was, I wonder why he was blue?!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the worst Disney cartoon you've ever seen?
Probably Dumbo.  You?
The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Oh yeah, I completely forgot about that one.  Truly one of Disney's darker moments.
It just wasn't a fun movie.  A box office failure to boot.
It's hard to make a good story about a hunchback.
Kind of sad really.  They had a talented lineup of musical players.
Yeah, but good music can only overcome so much.
I think Disney learned it's lesson: stick with princesses.
That's always a recipe for success.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Mufassa's death?
I think he should have seen it coming
It was the climax of the movie
It seems like, being a King, he would have been able to call for more help to save his son
I think the scene had a plot hole
How is that?
Scar's plan worked perfectly. The right person died
Maybe Scar just wanted the stampede to kill Mufassa
Scar was a very unlikable villain
He should have started his own pride
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just found out that they may not be doing songs in the Mulan remake!
I heard something like that too.  It would be a shame.
I loved Christina Agulera's version of Refection.
I loved all of the songs in the movie, they were so motivational.
There really weren't a whole lot of songs in that movie though.  At least not compared to some of the movies.
I wonder if it will be the same storyline, and if they will have Mushu.
They would have to have Mushu, he is the funniest character, along with the cricket.
I forget sometimes that Mulan is a war movie, I wonder how they would handle that as a live action movie?
It is a little darker than most Disney movies. Maybe they would change the actual war movie parts.
I don't know how they would. Fighting the Huns was a pretty big part of the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I showed my daughter The Little Mermaid for the first time!
Cute, did she like it?
Yeah, she was singing by the end of it!
I loved singing "A Whole New World" when I was little!
Same, it was my favorite movie.
My mom thought that I would burn out the vhs tape watching it so often!
I loved Prince Eric, but was super scared of Ursula.
My daughter was when she watched it too!
It's so cool to have them watch the movies we did when we were younger.
Disney movies never get old!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the new Beauty and the Beast!
It was so good, right?
Little Chip was so adorable!
He is the cutest. Gaston is horrible though!
When he was trying to kill the Beast I was like NOOOOO.
Me too! And then the Beast didn't kill him and let him go!
He is such a good guy. And he loved Belle so much.
He let her go because he loved her!
But she came back to save him!
Cutest movie ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What does Ursula want in The Little Mermaid?
She wants to get Ariel's voice.
Does she succeed?
At first, but you'll have to watch it to find out.
Is Alyssa Milano in it?
No, but Ariel's face was inspired by hers.
That is cool. Do you like the crab?
Yes, Sebastian is funny.
What is the yellow fish's name?
Flounder.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched up last night.
Dude, what did you think?
It made me cry.  I was not expecting that.
At which part?
All of them!  Especially the beginning when his wife died.
Yeah, gets me everytime.  I balled at the end too.
When the house was left there?
No, when he reads the storybook about having an adventure.
Oh yeah.  I was wiping away tears the whole time.  Such a good movie.
Maybe they'll make a sequel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Sword in the Stone was a classic film.
Yes, Merlin and Archimedes are amazing.
I don't think many people know about that one.
Yeah, it is a hidden classic in a way. But, the story is great.
What is your favorite part?
The wizard's duel of course.
Yes, I think that is a great scene.
I thought Archimedes was so funny.
He is definitely one of the top Disney owls.
Yes, and so is the one from The Fox and the Hound.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Aladdin?
Yes, I loved it when I was younger.
Ya I could practically quote the movie. The score is so good too.
I love the opening market song when aladdin is running away from the guards after stealing bread.
That is a good one. I love the genie and friend like me.
Robbins Williams was great in that role.
His voices and personality really made that role what it was.
Agreed without him as genie it would not have been the same movie at all.
Probably would not have been nearly as successful either.
I actually cried at the end when genie leaves. I know it is happy ending but I always get teary.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes, I saw it in the theater.
I thought it was very good.  What about you?
I really like Emma Watson and Josh Gad.  I also thought the singing was pretty good.
I read one review where he said Emma Watson wasn't a strong enough singer.  That didn't bother me at all.
I think her singing was just fine.  She is a very good actor.
I thought the Beast looked really cool.
They did a great job of making him look real.
Overall, I give it 7 out of 10.
That sounds about right.  I thought it was really good, but nothing great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you a fan of Disney movies?
No, not really. But I do like musicals.
Well, if you like musicals you'll definitely like Disney movies.
Oh really? What Disney movies do you think I'd like then?
The movies made during the "Disney Renaissance" would pique your interest I think.
Were those the ones made in the early-to-mid '90s?
Yes, they are. Being that you're a fan of musicals, I would suggest checking out "The Lion King". Tim Rice wrote the lyrics for the songs.
Oh I am very familiar with Tim Rice. Great lyricist.
After you watch that, you may want to check out "Beauty and The Beast". It's another film that plays very much like a classic musical, with characters voiced by Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach.
Oh that sounds neat. I know of Jerry Orbach from his long career as an off-Broadway actor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your all time favorite Disney movie?
I loved The Little Mermaid.
That's the first Disney movie that I can remember that they really had a new animation method from the films they did before.
Yeah, it didn't look like the old ones at all.
I love the look of the old Disney movies.
What is your favorite Disney movie?
Oh, well my favorite movie, much less Disney, is Alice in Wonderland.  It's the best movie there is.
Well, I guess that's a matter of opinion but I do like that movie a lot too.
It's great.  The Mad Hatter, The Cheshire Cat.  Tweetle Dee and Tweetle Dum.
And lets not forget "off with her head"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that old Disney movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?
Yes, of course!  I used to love that movie when I was growing up!
Me too!  I wish Disney would make a newer version.
That would be really cool, I would be first in line to the theatre to watch it.
How many of the seven dwarfs can you name? I think I know all of them.
I'm not sure, I know probably around 5 off the top of my head.
Did you know it first came out in 1937?
No I didn't.  For such an old film it is really good!
I agree, I didn't realise at first how old it was!
Neither, you've made me appreciate it even more now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mulan was such a great movie.
It's been years since I've seen it
I loved it as a kid. It just felt different somehow.
It does feel a little different from most Disney movies.
The songs were also really great.
I don't really remember them that much.
Maybe it's personal. I had to do a parody of one for an assignment in high school.
Like, with your own lyrics?
Yeah. I think I got an A.
Of course you did!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever watch Disney movies?
Yes, I have seen quite a few of them.
What is your favorite? I really like Beauty and the Beast.
I do too!  I hope to see the live action version that came out in 2017.
So do I.  I love the animated version, but I'm also a fan of Emma Watson and would love to see her play Belle.
I am curious to see how the new one compares to the original.
I think they have kept some of the same songs in but have also added new ones.
I have heard that too.  I am also looking forward to seeing Dan Stevens play the Beast.
Yes, so am I .  Did you know that Robbie Benson voiced the Beast in the animated version?
No I didn't.  That is a surprise; he doesn't strike me as someone who would voice the Beast.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the real to life Cinderella with Lily James and Cate Blanchett?
No, I haven't. When did it come out?
It was released in 2015. If you liked the animated Cinderella, you should check it out.
I will have to! I love the animated Cinderella by Disney.
Me too.
Can't believe it came out in 1950. Seems so long ago.
It does. Who's your favorite character?
I love Cinderella of course, but I also love the mice!
They really are cute. Gus is especially a favorite of mine. I like how his shirt is too tight!
He's adorable! I couldn't stand the black cat Lucifer. What a jerk!
XXXXXXXXXXX
moana is a great movie.
i agree! it has great music and even the rock as a voice actor!
i love the art style.
yes, the visuals are indeed great!
its too bad that the movie didnt go too in depth.
yea. i would have loved to see a tiny maui as well
me too, and also the gods that raised him.
yea, that would have been amazing.
watching him learn to use his hook would have been so cool.
and also watching how the gods made the hook, and the proccesses it took to do it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?
No.  I never even saw the cartoon from the 90s.
Really?  How could you have never even seen the cartoon?
I don't know.  I just never was into any of the Disney cartoons.
The movie was awesome.
I've heard that it was.
Do you plan on seeing the live action movie?
Not really.  I mean it seems too romantic for me.
Oh, it's a cultural icon though.
Just because everyone else is seeing it doesn't mean I will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of the new movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales?
Yes! It came out May 26th 2017!
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?
Yes I seen it in theaters in March.
Have you heard of Star Wars the Last Jedi?
Yes but it does not come out until December of 2017!
I cannot wait to watch the new Thor!
Yes! We should go to the theaters and watch it when it comes out in November!
Are you excited for the new Cars movie?
Cars 3? Yes, Finally it is coming out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That New Disney Movie Moana  was not boring in the least
How would you describe it
Unlike so many of their other recent films its not overstuffed
Overstuffed?
You know with bad songs and bloated
What do you mean by bloated
Well to many songs
That is good
Honestly it is a return to form
Glad it is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember the old Wonderful World of Disney TV show that used to come on every Sunday when we were kids?
No doubt. I always made a point to see it.
Walt Disney hosted it and I thought he was so cool back then.
Me, too.
Remember the Heidi controversy?
What was that?
It was Superbowl Sunday and a really close game was being played ....
Yes, and.....?
And it went into overtime but the station cut it off to play the movie Heidi People nearly rioted.
I remember hearing about that now that you mention it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you have any problems with Finding Dory?
There was one issue I had.
What was it?
It was the octopus. How was he able to stay out of the water for so long and survive?
Yes, that's true. He was out of the tank and blending into walls.
Maybe you should research as to whether octopi act like chameleons and can survive for a bit of time not in water.
I guess I could just to clear that up.
I thought the end with all the fish dropping out of the truck and into the ocean was hysterical.
Yes, that was funny. And I loved the song that played in the end.
What was the name of it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
monsters inc. was so good!
true. and they easily had one of the best sequels!
do you think it's because it was a prequel?
maybe! either way, i loved seeing their college years
it was so cool to see how their dynamic was set up over the years
yeah, the friendship aspect of the movie is so cool and important!
it really is, though
i weirdly kind of like randall
that is weird. he's the villain, he sucks!
but he sucks so well...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know which is the latest Disney movie?
Yes, Cars 3 was released on June.
Would you go to the cinema to watch it?
I think so. It's one of my favorite.
Same here. I saw the trailer and the graphics got way better.
Well, that doesn't mean it will be better than prequels
True, but I think Disney won't let us down.
Yeah they never fail to amaze me.
We should go to the cinema and watch it together.
Definitely. Can't wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you seen Moana disney movie yet?
Yes. I love it. I am looking for the song "Your Welcome".
I like that song too. Do you know who sing that?
Yes The Rock who sing that.
Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) is the voice behind maui?!
Thats right, I am surprize too. I never thought he can sing.
Really!?
Yes really!
Wow! He is into everything.
Yes. He is and he did a really good job on it to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the movie Tangled?
Yes, I do! I thought it was a lot of fun.
I thought Flynn Rider was a great character.
Yeah, he was really the lovable rogue with a heart of gold.
And Rapunzel was an interesting heroine.
She's so innocent about the world, and really conflicted about leaving the tower.
Yeah, I thought it really worked to show her struggle with coming out into the world.
Mother Gothel was a scary villain!
Even scarier because you could see how she manipulated Rapunzel.
And I loved the chameleon! He was a really fun touch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One Disney movie I didn't watch much growing up was Sleeping Beauty.
I did watch that when I was little but it wasn't a fave.
Did you like the Jungle Book?
I loved that when I was little! My favorite was the big bear.
Me too he was pretty funny.
Another great Disney movie was Snow White and the little Dwarfs.
Yes that is a definite classic! I loved it.
Which of the dwarfs was your favorite?
I would say probably Grumpy, I can relate the most to him.
I agree with you there!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The movie the Rescuers was so scary in some parts !
I know, they needed to find the diamond but it was risky
That movie did scare me as a kid and it was sad
it was a sad movie, Disney ca be very serious sometimes
yes, a lot of talk about Orphans or people that had been cursed or kidnapped
I was so worried about the litte girl in this movie
That lady was so evil though, trying to take the diamond
In the end it all worked out for them though
That is true, it has been so many years since I have seen that movie
I know, I think I was 8 years old when I first saw it on VHS
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Beauty and The Beast, how do you feel about it?
I have not yet acquainted myself with the movie, however I am keeping up with the movie.
When do you think you'll see it, the beauty is really daring with the Beasts in the castle?
I know as I read about it, feeling it would be a good idea at the theater.
The Beast and the beauty's friendliness made them get along.
For sure the beauty has an intelligence.
What would you think to rate the movie unseen? I saw and rated it 5/5
As unseen I will rate it 4/5.
That is a good rating unseen, you might give it 7 out of 5 after you see it.
I am afraid I would not do that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the movie Snow White?
Oh it´s a Disney classic, that is where the magic started.
Which is your favorite character from the movie?
I would have to say Dopey, he is very funny.
What do you think about the poisoned apple?
I think Snow White should had been more careful.
Do you think Snow White was the most beautiful one in the land?
I guess if the mirror said so, it should be true, but her step mother should now better since she had to get old eventually.
What song did you like most from the movie?
It´s very romantic, is called Someday My Prince Will Come.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge?
No, haven't yet checked it out.
How about the previous instalments of the series?
I watched part 1 and 2.
How do you like this series?
Well, to be honest it was kind of disgusting to watch those creatures on that ghost kind of ship.
Well, you get use to it with time.
Captain Sparrow is entertaining.
He sure is more than entertaining and his antics are at times too much.
He is the soul of the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about disney movies
Great i love them
Me too
Did you get into the Frozen hype?
Yes it was a great movie
It had a lot of lessons in it
And great music
Yes i loved the music
I really like olafs summertime song
That ine was so good
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Disney movie, Moana?
Yeah, I have! What did you think?
I liked it! I love Lin-Manuel Miranda, so it was great to hear music from him.
Actually, I thought the music could have been more memorable.
Moana got a couple of great songs. And I loved "Shiny"!
Okay, that whole sequence with the giant crab was great.
The animation was beautiful, too. All those green islands!
Yeah, it made me want to visit the South Pacific.
And I thought Maui was a great character. So funny, but with a heart.
I really enjoyed it, and I hope there's a sequel one of these days!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the first, or second Rescuers movie more?
The first one.
I agree. That stuff with the mean lady was more memorable
I liked th swamp setting a lot.
Did you like the Australian setting in part 2?
Yes, but not as much as I liked the swamp
They are both great though
I agree
Did you lik Tomorrow is Another Day?
Yeah, that song fit in the movie perfectly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just found our old DVD's. We watched The Little Mermaid.
So you mean the kids movies?
Yes, all the Disney movies. I love Sebastian.
He is a great character.
Ariel is a pretty Disney character.
Yes, she is. Don't like the big lady in the sea though.
I know. Ursella, is her name.
There is a lot of good songs in that movie.
I like the Under the Sea song.
Me too. It sticks in your head.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Princess and the Frog?
Yeah, a few years ago when I was babysitting my little cousin.
What'd you think?
Oh, I loved it.
Me too. Probably the best songs of any Disney movie.
And it's cool that there's a black princess for little girls to look up to.
The set of New Orleans was kind of perfect, right?
So right. The jazz, the Cajun culture...all so cool.
And I definitely cried when the firefly's light went out.
Me too. At least he's with Evangeline now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Frozen might have the most iconic songs Disney's ever created.
Oh, definitely not. Think of all the songs in the classics!
I was never much a fan of some of the older ones, though--Snow White is such a bore.
I'll give you that, but that was their very first film. What about Aladdin?
What songs does it have?
Well, most obviously there's A Whole New World!
Oh, that one is iconic! And that song the genie sings, too!
But of course, the most important one in my opinion is The Little Mermaid.
She's got Part of Your World, right?
And Under the Sea, and Poor Unfortunate Souls, and Kiss the Girl--you get the idea. It's easily the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally saw the new Beauty and Beast movie.
The cartoon?
No, the live action one.
What did you think of the movie?
I liked the acting.
What about the music?
I thought they had a bit too much music.
It was a musical.
Well, even too much for a musical.
I loved the whole thing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the new release of Thor: Ragnarok?
Nah.  I'm not really into those kinds of movies.
I hear it's really good.  I don't really like those movies either, but they are fun to watch in the summer.
I can agree with this.  I like super hero movies, just not Thor for some reason.
Yeah, I don't get the appeal of Chris Hemsworth.
I don't either, he's not even that good looking.
They should put Orlando Bloom in a super hero movie.
I can get behind that idea, he's gorgeous!
Yes!  I've loved him since Lord of the Rings.
He's so good looking in the Pirates movie series, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can never watch The Fox and the Hound ever again.
Did you watch it recently?
Yeah, I watched it yesterday.
Why can't you ever watch it again?
I forgot how sad it was.
What part is sad?
First off, when Tod's mom dies.
Oh, I remember that. It's awful!
Also, when Tod's owner leaves him in the forest. I bawled my eyes out.
I probably shouldn't watch that movie anytime soon! I'm not up for a sad movie like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the comedy in Disney's Aladdin film?
Yeah I did.
Me too, funny right?  Robin Williams was on fire.
He did a solid job.
In an unexpected way.
They did a good thing casting him.
I still love the song A Whole New World.
A friend's daughter sang it at school.
Was there an Aladdin 2 film made?
I don't know but I'll find out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Disney princess?
Um, Rapunzel is my favorite!
What do you like about her?
I like how she fights bad guys with her hair and she hits bad guys with a frying pan.
What is the movie she is in?
She is in Tangled, and she is stolen from her mom and dad and raised by an old witch!
Is there anything special about her?
Her hair is magical and can heal.
She sounds like a pretty cool princess.
She is, and I love her really long blonde hair.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss old-school Disney animation.
I can see that. Which do you mean?
Stuff like The Little Mermaid or 101 Dalmatians.
You're right. No cartoon films look like that anymore.
I like their 3D stuff, but I just miss the classics.
There is something to be said for appreciating the old way of doing something.
I can't even remember the last time I saw an animated film that wasn't all 3D.
Even the ones I have seen look like they were all done with computers.
I miss that hand-wrought style of the 80s and 90s.
I wonder if Disney will ever go back to it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney film can you not live without?
The Little Mermaid
Why?
The character reminds me a lot of me
Ariel?
Yes
She is beautiful and smart. I see what you mean
Thanks! I like that movie a lot. It is very deep
I agree. Literally and figuratively.
Let's watch it right now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really enjoyed the original avengers movie.
Having all of my favorite superheros in one movie was epic.
I still need to see the sequel.
Me too, its on my movie list.
I think iron man is my favorite.
I really like Captain America more.
The action is so well done.
Yes, and the actors really make the story believable.
The story writing and how they all found each other in the 1st film was well done.
I'm not sure if I could ever be an Avenger.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw a clip of Kristen Bell on Ellen singing that Frozen song!
Which one did she sing?
The Snowman song, she's highly talented with her voice acting.
I'll have to take a look, that whole movie is so darn catchy!
I know it's been a few years now, and my kids still want to watch it every week!
That's hilarious. You must have all of the songs memorized at this point.
It's a great movie for the kids and encourages love with their siblings.
I did love the new direction they went with the Prince being the ultimate villain.
It was an awesome example to set for little girls everywhere.
I agree I loved the message of the whole movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well several disney movies  just feel like filler
What does that mean
It means they do not feel fully fleshed out
Give me an example
The lion king two is a perfect example
But i liked it
It was ok but it forgot the impact of the first
Why do you think that
Nothing was as touching or memorable
Maybe it could be
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you waiting for any disney movie?
Oh yes , I'm eager for Wreck-It Ralph 2!
Oh , I didn't see the first one , what's it about?
It's about video games having a life of their own!
Wow , that sounds so very interesting ! Please tell me more about this movie
Basically the video game character that you play as at any arcade have a life of their own. The have jobs as video game character.
This movie is unlike any movie I've ever seen ? What is the protagonist like?
The protagonist is actually a bad guy from a video game, he get tired of being the bad guy and leaves the game and chaos ensues.
I have to watch this movie right now !
Haha ,  watch it , you won't regret it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Flubber was a disney movie?
No, I should have!
I loved Robin Williams in it.
He always did a great job on what he acted in.
His character was hilarious.
He was meant to play the role of a lovable scientist.
Well he was in charge of many other things.
I loved how the story was so fluid
What specifically?
Just how he managed to have so many quirky one liners while maintaining his laughter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Peter Pan?
Yes and I love the ride at Disneyland too.
That is a lot of fun. Who is your favorite character?
I like Wendy. She is so nice.
I agree. Peter is pretty cool too.
Yeah, I also like their dog in the beginning.
Oh, you mean Nana?
Yes, that dog is so sweet. I like when Tinkerbell puts the fairy dust on it and it flies up a little.
Where does that movie take place?
In London and in Neverland.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My daughter and I watched Brave last week.
Oh, I love that movie!
Me too. Sharing it with my daughter made me love it even more.
Remember how much we loved the posture scenes?
Where they would stand up straight and quietly walk through a room of men?
Yes!  And all the men would suddenly shape up.
My daughter is trying that out now.
Awesome! Merida is a Disney princess that you can feel good about your daughter emulating.
Yes. She is fully clothed, and refuses to be a child bride.
I'm so glad Disney bought Pixar.  They really do some awesome stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Dumbo?
Yes I did. One of disney's best in my mind.
I loved it as well. I heard they are making a remake.
Really? I wonder why?
I think disney is doing that lots in general.
Ya these days most studios are.. nothing left originall I suppose.
Or they are lazy to come up with new ideas.
Ha! Maybe true. I am intriuged at a dumbo remake though.
Well it is said to be a real life version.. kind of similar to what they did with beauty and the beast.
Oh that maybe pretty neat! I wonder how they would manage a flying elephant... cgi probably.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know if they're planning to do a Little Mermaid live action remake?
I haven't heard anything about it. With the way they've been going this route, it's only a matter of time.
I think they will do Pocahontas first and then perhaps something like Aladdin.
Little Mermaid would be a lot more fun to remake. The ocean setting, the world undersea would be fantastic to recreate with today's technology and CGI available to Disney.
I think that's why it would also be difficult to do because that sounds like it would be a really big budget project.
When have you known Disney to not go all out on a film of theirs? They're the kings of current big productions!
That's true, you're right, I could imagine it. I hope the Little Mermaid get's moved up the list. I really want to see who would play the new Ariel.
There are so many options. I'm excited about how they would approach the sea.
I need more Sebastian the crab in my life!
There's a slight homage to Sebastian in Moana if you caught it, the end credits.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they'll make a sequel to Zootopia?
I imagine so, it made a ton of money.
What do you think the story would be about?
Judy Hopps stops a predator on a routine traffic stop and ends up shooting and killing them for no reason
Yeah, I don't see Disney making that movie.
Her partner Nick Wilde sees the whole thing and has to lie for her.
This doesn't feel very Disney.
The climax is a tense courtroom scene where the city offers a $3M settlement to the grieving family in return for their silence.
This got really dark, really quick.
Over the credits, various unseen cell phone footage is shown of Judy and Nick covering it up. The End!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the movie Up again.
Oh I remember that movie making me cry.
Ya I still cried at the end when he reads the book his wife left about her favorite memories.
Ya that part always gets me.
There are some really funny parts like with the dogs.
I liked Russell too and how much he helped bring out joy in Mr. Fredricksen.
Ya it had some really good messages about living life to the fullest.
i really like that about Pixar films they seem almost more for adults with the message.
Ya but they are still great for kids because of all the colors and funny characters.
I will have to watch UP again now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite disney character?
It's got to be Goofy!
Woah, me too! I loved A Goofy Movie!
No kidding, that's my favorite disney movie of all time!
Me too! Whats your favorite scene?
Obviously the powerline concert at the end of the film!
Mine is when Goofy and Max are travelling along the river in their broken down car
And when Goofy nearly died at the waterfall, I almost lost it!
Me too, its quite a tear jerker
Best movie of 1996 by far
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, best Disney movies of the 2000s.
Wow you're going for the big questions! Okay best Disney movies .... I mean honestly Holes was one of the greatest movies, period.
Wow you really are my soulmate! I loved Holes, I still know all the words from that song at the end.
Of course! Okay well what were some of your favorites?
Well, the Lizzie McGuire movie, hands down. It's what made me want to go to Rome!
That's a really good one too. I had it on VHS. I'm still upset they didn't put Miranda in the movie!
Right! It was a dishonor to the original trio. And personally I was mad Lizzie and Gordo got together.
Can't say the same, I had been rooting for them since the TV show.
You know who I was rooting for? Ethan Kraft.
Ethan Kraft, the typical teenage hearthrob! I really do miss those movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that Disney animated movie that starred Mandy Moore?
You mean Tangled?
Yes, that's the one. What is that story about?
It's basically the Rapunzel plot, with a few new twists.
I see. I think I've heard one of the songs from it.
It might be "When Will My Life Begin." That's probably the most popular one.
It could be. How did you like Mandy Moore in that role?
I thought she was awesome. I've always liked her as a singer and actress, though.
Me, too.
It's a pretty funny movie as well. A lot of people like Frozen more, but I am rather fond of Tangled.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did Toy Story come out?
The original was released in 1995.
Who was the voice of Woody?
Tom Hanks, who also was Woody's voice in Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3.
Have you heard they're making a third sequel?
Yes, Toy Story 4 has an anticipated release date in 2019.
What was that thing Buzz Lightyear always says?
To Infinity and Beyond.
What kind of toy was Woody?
A cowboy sheriff doll.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Splash Mountain in Disneyland based on any movie?
Song of the South.
I haven't heard of that movie.
You can't get it in the United States as Disney never released it on video.
Why not?
There are those who feel it's controversial and racial.
But the music is so good.
I know and the ride makes it look like it's a good story.
Do you think it might come out one day?
Probably not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Cars 3 came out this past weekend.  Have you seen it yet?
No but I hear it is really good.
I haven't seen it yet either but I am really looking forward to it.
Yes, I am looking forward to it too.Hey maybe we can go together this weekend.
I would really like that.  Do you mind if I bring my grandson along?
That would be cool and I will bring my niece along.
My grandson will want to watch it over and over again just like he did with the Troll movie.
My niece loved the other two Cars movies so she will surely love this one as much.
It will definitely be fun and we get to see the up and coming youngster car.
My daughter loves McQueen and Mater.  We will see you guys Saturday afternoon for the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a good film?
Yes and it was the first full length feature from Disney
Cool. Did it come out in the 70's?
No, the 30's
Which Dwarf do you like the most?
Bashful
He is funny
Did you like the witch?
She was scary
I agree. Especially when she turned into the witch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard your son likes dinosaurs?
Yes, he is a big fan of them.
Is he also a fan of Disney movies?
He loves all Disney movies.
Did he see The Good Dinosaur?
No, is it good?
It is fantastic, I highly recommend watching it!
Awesome!
Here is my DVD. You can borrow it for him to watch.
Thank you so much, he is going to love it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that they're finally making a live action version of Lion King?
I heard rumors but I didn't know that it was actually happening.
It's supposed to come out July 2019.
Cool! Lion King was my favorite movie when I was little.
I'm just glad that they got James Earl Jones to pay Mufasa again.
No one else could've voiced Mufasa besides him.
I agree. I think that Donald Glover will do a good job as Simba too.
He was a great actor in Atlanta, I believe he'll do this part justice.
I'm most excited for the songs to be remade.
The songs are what make any Disney movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like sequels are never any good.
Oh, I totally disagree with you there--think about Disney!
What good sequels did Disney ever make?
Well, think about the Toy Story movies and Finding Dory, those were both sequels.
Oh, I cried my eyes out at Toy Story 3!
The way they handled the Andy and Woody storyline was so sweet.
And it was really sentimental for me, too, since I was about the same age as Woody.
I was really nervous when the first announced another sequel, but they really knew what they were doing.
And I guess Toy Story 2 was pretty good, too.
Oh for sure! I cry at Jessie's song every time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
the lion king was my favorite disney movie do you have one
not really I like so many of them
the animation is their movies is beyond the top
yes especially as technology keeps advancing, how about frozen
yes they did a terrific job with that one
remember in the early days like cinderella and snow white how much difference there was
for sure but still love to watch them as well
oh I agree walt disney is one phenomenal company the produces top quality of everything
makes me want to watch a disney movie now
lets go watch mullan at my house right now
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Cars movie yet?
No, but I'd like to. What number is it?
It's the third in the series.
Do you think they'll make more?
it's entirely possible. Kids, especially little boys, adore it.
True. My son likes it, but he prefers Monsters Inc.
That's a great movie! Have you seen Monsters University as well?
Yes, probably a thousand times. He also likes to watch the Toy Story trilogy.
Toy Story is my favorite too!
Those little aliens in the claw machine are the cutest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember the Disney movie Alladin?
Of course I remember Alladin!  That was one of my favorites as a kid.
Mine too.  I always said I'd name my first daughter Jasmine, and then I did!
It's just a hilarious movie, especially with the genie.
Wasn't it played by Robin Williams?
Yes, he's hilarious.
They actually made a few sequels but none of them were as good as the original.
Oh really?  Like what?
Well, I know Return of Jafar was one of them.  I watched it but it wasn't too great.
I never heard of that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the Disney movie with the singing crab?
The Little Mermaid!
That's right! That was the one where the mermaid girl wanted to find love so she went on land to meet the prince, right?
Yes! Ariel sold her voice to the evil sea witch Ursula so that she could go on land.
Did she get her voice back?
Yes! Did you see the movie?
No, I just saw a commercial for it on a kid's television station. I don't know very much about it.
It's a good movie! Eventually Ariel and Prince Eric fall in love and get married.
Does it have any songs that I would recognize?
Kiss the Girl is from the Little Mermaid and that is very popular!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Cruella D'Ville was a 'good' villain?
I'm not too sure about that. Who wants to ever make a coat out of a dog's skin?
I am not sure but I lived the fact that her hair was perfectly split between black and white.
I like the way she drove like a maniac.
The style of car was very befitting as well.
I agree. I could not picture her having the same effect if she had driven a VW bug or a side panelled station wagon.
What about how thin she is with her pointy cheek bones and long skeletal fingers?
I know it makes her look like a ghostly nightmare lady.
I like her aristocratic nature.
I think she does make a good villain.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Fantasia make any sense to you?
No, but I don't think it was supposed to?
How do you mean?
Well, it was sort of just music and imagery right? There was no narrative.
No, there definitely was not. I was not expecting that.
Well, it's still art isn't it?
I suppose. It was pretty bold for the 1940s. No kid could have sat through that.
No, but it was still stimulating.
And beautiful. The animation was really quite good.
Yeah, they were sort of interpretive vignettes eh?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What should we do tonight?
Hey, let's watch Tangled!
Tangled, Tangled... that's the Disney Rapunzel movie, right?
I mean, yes, sort of? But it's a lot more than that. There's a handsome rogue, a heroic horse. An evil witch.
You're describing every Disney movie ever made.
No, this one is different. It's funny and clever, and there's some amazing stuff about healthy parental relationships.
Oh, so the main character isn't an orphan? Maybe this ISN'T a typical Disney movie.
Don't be a jerk. These things are stereotypes because they have emotional resonance. Anyway, I'm telling you, especially with your relationship with your mom, you'd like this movie a lot.
Yeesh. I trust you, I guess. Let's watch Tangled.
Yes! You're going to love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Frozen?
I really like the movie in general but I saw a lot of behind the scenes clips that would have made the movie so good!
I saw them too, but they changed a lot last minute.
I enjoyed it overall though. I'm glad we have another princess that is reasonable in her thinking about love.
Like Merida!
Yes!
Plus I mean she was only what, 14?
I believe so. You don't have to fall in love at first sight.
Absolutely not.
Love is there all along!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hi
What are you up to
Just watching old movies
What kind
stuff from my childhood
What movie
The lion king
Oooh i love that one
It was my favorite as a kid
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Probably Flubber.
Wow, I was not expecting that.
Yea most people don't, but Robin Williams is amazing.
I agree, he was really good as the genie in Aladdin as well.
Yes he was! Does he do any role bad?
I can't think of any.
He's just so funny and owns whatever role he takes.
Yea, Disney did good by hiring him a few times.
Has he done any other Disney movies?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No, I haven't, but I liked the first three.
I didn't like the fourth one, because Will and Elizabeth weren't in it.
It was the same for me. The first three had very good characters.
Davy Jones and his entire ship were really creepy, though.
That's true, but it made him a good villain.
Barbossa wasn't as creepy, I ended up liking him a lot!
The scenes with all of the pirates fighting together in the third movie were my favorite.
I especially liked that Elizabeth ended up with her own ship during that battle.
She also was the pirate queen!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney Movie?
I really like the Lion King.
I grew up watching Disney. That is one of my favorites.
My boyfriend hates that I sing all of the songs.
I used to cry when mufasa died.
Me too. I was so little when I first saw it.
Me too! Only 5 when it came out.
Probably bugged my mom from watching it 100 times.
I think my parents loved it as much as I did.
I hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have great news!
What is your news?
That new movie, Moana, is on Netflix!
Really?
Yes, I was so excited, my kids and I watched it right away.
I think that it's great that Netflix picks up newer movies.
Me too, my kids watched Zootopia twice a day, everyday, it's nice to switch it up a bit.
Zootopia is a good movie too.
I agree, I'm just glad we can throw some variety into the mix now and again.
I will have to bring over some popcorn and watch Moana with you guys this weekend!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that the Moana movie is now on Netflix?
Yes, my daughters watched it the other night.
I'm glad because my daughter requested it for her birthday and now I don't have to buy it.
Those Disney movies are so expensive but I worry that they won't be on Netflix forever. What are you getting her instead?
She also requested Moana's necklace, the one with the heart of Tafiti. It lights up. I grabbed the last one at Wal-Mart.
You know what else you should get her? The Moana soundtrack. The music in that movie is so catchy.
That's a good idea. We're also getting her her first tablet so I could buy the soundtrack online and put it on there for her.
Oh yeah, she'll love it. That song with the hermit crab who likes shiny things was my favorite.
Yeah, I loved that guy too! Make sure to watch after the credits of Moana because he has an extra little scene where he talks about Sebastian from the Little Mermaid.
Oh, I didn't know that! I will have to tell my girls.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the traditional Disney Princess movies or the more current ones?
Are you referring to "Snow White" and "Cinderella" when you say traditional?
Yes, I think the "Snow White" movie from 1937 would qualify as traditional.
I did not know how old that movie was.
I like the updated versions of some of the Disney Princess movies, like the second part to "Cinderella".
I agree. The sequel versions reflect more of today's values for female characters.
I like how the princesses involve many different girls from different places.
I think that is what helps to sell so many tickets to these movies.
I would like to see a "super-hero" princess for Disney's next princess movie.
I do not think "princess" and "super-hero" go together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
That's a hard one. I think I'm going to go with The Lion King.
Why that movie over all the others?
Well, it was my first Disney movie.
That's it?
Of course not. That movie made me really feel for characters in a movie.
Which characters? If I had to guess I'd say Mufasa and Simba.
I'm going to say Simba and Scar.
Why Scar?
I've never hated a fictional character more than Scar for what he did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which prine do you find most handsome in disney movies?
Well I have always liked prince Eric.
He was cute with his big blue eye's and dark hair.
Totally, also max the dog adds to his appeal.
He is like a classic idea of a prince.
Yes but most disney princes our.
Well not in Beauty and the Beast.
That is a good point. I never think of him in the human form.
He doesn't have much screen time as a human does he.
Also do we ever find out his name? Like is belle going to call him beast forever? wish they would have said it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Up?
No I never caught it. What was the jist of it.
Basically a windowed man turns his house into a blimp with balloons.
That sounds like it wouldn't work.
But it did. And adventure ensues.
No doubt. I heard it was a bit depressing though.
Emotional. It was emotional.
Does something bad happen to the old man?
I'm not going to spoil it. Watch it for yourself?
I'll stream it one of these days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever the the movie The Pacifier?
You mean with Vin Diesel?
That's the one.
No, I really don't like him as an actor.
Me either, but it was actually a cute movie.
Really.
Yes. nothing was on T.V, so I kept that on.
How old was that?
It's from 2005.
Makes me feel old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know that The Lion King was essentially Hamlet right?
Was it now? I did not know that.
Oh yes. The plot points and character development are basically identical.
How do you mean?
Well, Mustafa is killed by his brother Scar, just like in Hamlet.
Okay, and so Simba was the Hamlet figure?
That's right. It's a coming of age and revenge story for him.
But the ending was a little less bleak, right?
Ha! Yes, the bad guy dies in the end and everyone lives happily ever after.
Well, I suppose that's only appropriate for Disney.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear they're finally making a new "Incredibles" movie?
Oh, great!  I love that one.  It's a long time between the original and the sequel.
I know.  Hopefully it will be worth the wait.
Mr. Incredible is the best.
What about Frozone?  That scene where he says "Honey, where's my super suit"?
Hysterical.  The way his wife answers is the super funny.
Is Syndrome going to be the villain?
I have no idea.  Wasn't he killed in the first movie?
Will the kids be the same age do you think, or grown up?
I don't know.  Maybe Jack-Jack will be in high school or something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that they are making a Cars 3 movie?
Yeah! I just found out about that when I was watching TV the other day.
I'm so excited! Who is your favorite character?
I love Lightning McQueen! How about you?
Same! I'm excited to see the new characters in Cars 3 though.
Me too! Have you been to Cars Land in Disneylan?
Yes! It is so awesome. I feel like I am in the movie.
Same. Especially with the music they play.
My favorite is the song Life is a Highway.
I hope they have it in Cars 3 too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
They are going to be making a show about Cruella De Vil before 101 Dalmations starring Emma Stone.
I can't wait to see that. Is it like a pre-quel to the shows.
I think so. It is not being released for a year or two but I always liked the live action one with Glenn Close.
Yes and Jasper and Horace were so funny.
Yes and Hugh Laurie was so funny as Jasper. A lot different than his character on House.
It showed a side to his acting abilities that are unbelievable. And Glenn Close is always a number one hitmaker.
Do you think Emma Stone will be able to play Cruella as well as Glenn Close did?
Will have to see but I can't wait to see how the puppies outwit her.
Yes, no matter how close she came to getting her spotted coat, it always ends in chaos for her.
The villain never wins in a Disney show.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So did you see the Duck Tales movie from the 1990's?
I totally did. It was excellent.
I watched it again recently. All I can say is: I want a money bin!
Ha! And are you going to swim in a sea of gold coins? I think that would hurt.
It's totally doable. If Scrooge can do it, I can too.
Did the nephews ever swim in the bin?
I can't recall. Huey, Dewey and Louie right?
Yeah. I don't think Scrooge would let them near the money.
No, he was pretty guarded with it.
Well he's Scottish. He can't help it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Toy Story movies?
Yeah, I actually didn't mind them.
Does your kid ever watch them?
No, all she ever wants to watch is Frozen.
Oh, I bet you'd rather her watch Toy Story.
Yeah, just overall more fun.  And nostalgic with the toys.
Yeah, I'm sure.  Did you see all three of the Toy Story movies?
I've seen them all.  I've probably seen the last one more than the others.
I guess that means you like the last one the best.
Maybe a little.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Snow White always used to freak me out as a kid.
Why's that, it's one of my favorites.
Well the scene where the Huntsman attempts to kill her is disturbing.
Oh very true, the animation was very fluid and realistic.
Yup that's what would do me in, it was a really tense scene for a kid.
I thought for sure you were going to say the dwarves scared you.
Oh they did, I can't leave them out.
But they're all so adorable.
Not really, a bunch of little men living in the woods like that give me the willies.
You're something else my friend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Isn't it crazy how much Disney has grown in the past 10 years or so?
Yeah, it really is! They acquired Pixar and started making awesome movies like Inside Out, Finding Nemo, and Toy Story!
Yes and more recently they acquired Marvel! So how all the Marvel movies are Disney too.
All of The Avengers movies??
Yes all of the Avengers movies and all the ones that will come out in the future!
I think one of the smartest things Disney ever did was acquire the Star Wars franchise.
Definitely! I, personally, will see every Star Wars movie that's released. I actually feel more confident with Disney at the helm.
I was a big fan of The Force Awakens!
I can't wait to see The Last Jedi!
Yes! We need more Luke Skywalker! Did you see the latest trailer?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?
Yeah! I watched it in theaters when it came out.
Oh really? How was it?
I liked it a lot. I don't really remember the original, though, so I couldn't compare.
Yeah, I haven't seen the original in years. I still want to watch it, though.
We could watch it together when it comes out on DVD!
Okay! Sounds like a plan.
We should watch the original first!
Oh yeah. That is a really good idea.
Sweet. I will see if I have it tucked away somewhere.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Toy Story That Time Forgot?
No! I didn't realize there are more Toy Story movies than 1, 2 and 3!
Yeah! Remember Bonnie from the third Toy Story movie? It's from her perspective!
That's awesome! I'll have to watch that one!
It's so good! It's not as long as a movie so I don't think it gets the credit it deserves.
That's disappointing. I know other movies have done short spin offs but I didn't know about Toy Story!
Woody and Buzz actually have small roles in this one. Bonnie has multiple toys that were at the Daycare in the third one and one of those is the main character.
Interesting! Which toy is the main character then?
It's the dinosaur named Trixie. It mainly has dinosaurs in it! It's definitely worth watching.
I think all of the Toy Stories are definitely worth watching!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wait, is it still Disney movie if pixar makes it?
um... yes.
Um Why is that?
Because Disney own pixar. And pixar is one of its studios.
But Disney animator didn't make the film.
yes they did. pixar is ONE of Disney's studios. All of pixar is Disney, wholly owned.
That's weird.
more business than I'd like for one day.
I can't wait for the incredibles's sequel.
Next summer. That' when it will be released. That's going to be so good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my least favorite Disney movies is Peter Pan. Do you like it?
I agree. Not much of a fan.
Peter Pan isn't that much of a likeable character.
No he's not. Even the villain isn't and I actually like some of them.
I know. The best character is Tinker Bell, and she doesn't even talk.
That's funny.
Wendy is another one. The smaller kids are cute in the movie.
Yes, I just don't know why that one was such a big hit.
Me either. Disney usually does real good movies.
Well, you figure back then, maybe they didn't have as good of writers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?
Not yet was it good.
I haven't seen it. We should rent it.
I wonder if they have it out on Netflix.
I am not sure it was an older one that I saw.
That is a bummer!
Who is Bella in the movie?
Emma Watson. She is a super great actress!
The beast is Dan Stevens.
I am unsure who he is. We should still watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many times have you seen Frozen?
My goodness, it's my daughter's favorite movie. I think I've seen it over 10 times!
My son loves singing "Let It Go"! I'm going crazy!
I know what you mean. The soundtrack is playing nonstop in my car. My daughter won't let me play anything else.
I'm trying to get him to watch some of the more classic Disney movies, like Snow White or Aladdin.
We've watched the live-action Cinderella, which my daughter really liked.
It just seems like every classic Disney movie has a really scary part that my son won't watch.
Yeah, either someone's parent dies like Bambi or there's a really scary monster like in Sleeping Beauty.
My favorite Disney movie is The Little Mermaid. Great songs and so colorful!
I agree, that's a great movie but Ursula is just too scary for my daughter so we haven't watched past the beginning of that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My daughter can't stop watching Mary Poppins.
That's pretty cool for an eight year old to like!
She just loves Mary and her whimsical charms.
I've always preferred Fred myself.
I wonder if they'll do a remake of that movie.
I hope not.  There's really no reason to.
Yeah, but Disney seems to remake everything these days.
I get that, but some things should be left alone.
Well get ready, the remake is coming next year.
Oh no!  Why, Disney, why?
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you were one of the seven dwarfs, which one would you be?
Do you mean like from Snow White?
Yes! I think I would be sleepy.
I am a little sleepy right now, but I think I would be happy.
I might even be sneezy with all of the allergies I have been experiencing.
No kidding! I am definitely sneezy this time of year.
Snow White was always my favorite Disney princess. I think she is so beautiful.
I really like Snow White as well. I think she has a beautiful voice.
She definitely has an amazing voice. I always wished I could sing like her.
So did I, I wanted to be just like her when I grew up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Peter Pan animated movie?
Of course! Is a classical!
Which is your favorite character?
Is Tinkerbell, I think she is very funny and cute.
Which is your favorite scene of the movie?
When Peter Pan rescues Tiger Lily.
Do you think Captain Hook is a mean villain.
Of course he is! He is also very creepy.
What do you think about his minion Doc?
I think he could not have had a better one, he is loyal and funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you see the new beauty and the beast?
Yes, it was so good!
Do you like this one better than the old one?
Yes! I liked that they added new songs to the movie
What was your favorite scene?
Definitely when he turns back to a human!
That was my favorite scene too!
Emma Watson did an amazing job as belle, don't you agree?
of course, she was the Perfect belle!
The whole cast was perfect!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, please tell me what you think of Lilo and Stitch.
It has been forever since I've seen the movie, so I really can't say much about it.
Do you at least remember Stitch?
Yes, I do remember the little blue alien.
What did you think about him?
I remember that he got in all kinds of mischief.
Yes, he did. I think that made the movie.
It did because I still can remember those aspects of the movie.
The movie was basically based on the antics.
If I can recall, they were hilarious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was going through old VHS movies and found so many Disney movies.
I have so many too. No one watches them.
We have one VCR yet. I was going to put Air Bud in.
Is that the movie about the dog?
Yes. The dog that plays basketball.
That was cute.
I forgot about it. My son used to love the movie.
Mine too.
Disney comes up with some cute ideas for movies.
They do. I wonder how they train the animals?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Peter Pan is definitely one of the most well known Disney movies of all times.
I totally agree, I think everyone knows who Peter Pan is!
Yeah, and even more so Tinkerbell and Captain Hook!
So true. Plus there were so many versions that came out.
Yeah, like Hook and the live verison of Peter Pan, not just the cartoon!
There was also that newer one, but I can't remember what it was called.
I think it was called Pan?
Yes! That's it! It was about the beginning of Hook and Peter Pan's relationship.
Yeah! It was so unexpected, I would never imagine they'd be helping each other.
Yeah, considering the whole animated movie is The Lost Boys at war with the Pirates!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish they would make another movie like The Emperor's New Groove.
That was a great movie! It was so funny.
Even the villain, Yzma, was funny!
I loved her and her sidekick, Kronk. I'll never forget that "Pull the lever, Kronk!" scene.
Also, Kronk could talk to squirrels.
I guess he was more Disney Princess than villain, since he could talk to animals!
Does that mean Kuzco was the ultimate Disney Princess, since he turned into an animal?
I don't think that's how it works!
My favorite part was when Yzma detailed her evil plan, though.
That was hilarious!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What disney movie do you like?
Tangled
That one was so good
I didnt like the brown hair on the princess
It did look wierd
I loved it in that braid though
Me too
It was so pretty
It was really pretty
I understand why it was cut though
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched Frozen last night for about the twentieth time.
That's funny. I saw it once.
I liked Olaf, did you?
Of course. Which sister did you like better?
I don't know. They both had issues.
I liked Anna better.
It would be cool to be able to live in such a cold environment.
Not for me.
I don't know, obviously a fairytale but a neat idea.
Yes it is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Lion King 1/2 yesterday.
1/2? What are you talking about?
Yeah. I think that's the title?
Was it any good?
Ohh! It was really good.
I didn't know Disney made a second movie.
1 1/2! That's the title.
What was it about?
Lots of backstory regarding Simba, Nala, and Pumbaa. It makes the first Lion King really good.
I don't like watching sequels to good movies, but I'll take your word on it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Am I the only one that hated Aladdin?
Why did you hate Aladdin?
I just didn't think it was that good.  It was annoying actually.
What part?  You mean the Genie?
Yes, the Genie.  Robin Williams got on my nerves.
He was over the top, but that was the point.
I have to admit, I did dig those songs.
I remember hearing 'A Whole New World' at my middle school dance.
My goodness, we are some old folks.
Who know our Disney, mind you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Lilo and Stitch?
Yes, it's one of my favorites!
Oh, I really love that movie!
I know, it always makes me want to visit Hawaii.
I love the music in it too.
I agree! All the Elvis tunes are awesome.
There are so many funny characters in it.
I agree, a very colorful cast.
The imagery is awesome in it too!
I know - it almost makes you feel like you are in the movie. Very captivating.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Brave?
Oh my goodness, yes!  That movie was awesome!
It was beautiful to look at.  And the movie was so awesome!
I know!  How great was it that she decided to stand up for herself and not be forced to marry any of those losers?
Yeah, that arrow contest was really cool
Also, I loved her relationship with her mom
Wasn't it great when her mom  was turned into a bear, but she still kept her personality, down to wearing her crown?
The mother  was payed by Emma Thompson
Yeah,  and Merida was Kellly McDonald
It was a good family movie, great mother/daughter relationship
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Fantasia?
I hate that movie.  It's just a bunch of werid cartoons with music.
Really? I love it!
Uh, that thing is so boring!
I love all the little cartoons! The Sorceror's Apprentice is classic.
Mickey never talks! It's boring.
What about Night on Bald Mountain?
Scary as heck!
I disagree.  I love it.
Glad somebody does.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw recently that the first movie Mickey Mouse was in was called "Steamboat Willie".
What year was that?
Something like 1928.
Was it in color?
I don't think so. Maybe that's why you never see it now.
Was Minnie Mouse in that one, too?
I think so.  She's been there from the beginning!
Wow, they've been dating for almost 90 years!
Right?  He should propose!
I know!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that there's a new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
I know. I'm so happy they made another one.
I heard this was going to be the last one.
That's sad, but how long could Johnny Depp keep playing Jack Sparrow?
Forever! He's the kind of character that would still be great at 70.
Maybe. I do love Depp and Sparrow.
And it isn't like it is romance heavy.
True. Though at some point it has to end.
No, no it doesn't.
Yeah, you are right. Long live Jack Sparrow, even if he has to come back as a ghost.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Finding Tory?
Yeah, that movie was so hyped!
It was a really good movie, Gerald was so cute!
Yeah, Gerald should have a spin-off movie, he's popular.
Yeah right? Enough of baby Nemo and baby Dory, it's time for grown up Gerald.
Exactly, Gerald, Gerald, Gerald.
What about the story line, should it be like, Finding Gerald?
Well, we had finding Nemo, finding Dory, maybe we can take it to another level.
Hmm, good idea. How about Gerald finding success, or Gerald finding the meaning of life?
Excellent ideas!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which do you like better Toy Story or Cars?
Definitely, Toy Store.
Have you seen the sequels to both?
Yes, they were all great.
Do you think you'll continue watch Disney movies even after you've reached a certain age?
Of course, Disney movies are the best!
What was the first Disney movie you ever watched?
It was Snow White.
Who's your favorite Disney Prince?
Prince Eric.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Say, did you hear they are going to put out a new Shrek movie.
I did hear that.  Number five I think.
Gees.  I can't believe they've got four movies out of that series.
It's huge though.  Have you seen all the Shrek junk out there you can buy.
I know.  I got my niece a Shrek doll for Christmas.  I thought it would be out of date for her but no she loved it.
Knew all the charitures I bet.
Oh, yeah we even had to watch a couple of them later that day.  She has all the DVD's of course.
Your a good uncle.  Are you going to take her to the new Shrek?
You know I hear it's not even due out till 2019.  So who knows.
Wow, well I'm sure it will be worth waiting for.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Cars movie?
Yeah, you mean the 3rd installment
Yup, Really liked it. The introduction of new characters, the retiring of old ones.
Hmmm. Yeah i wonder if its time to retire the franchise though.
Whaaaaaat!!! No No No. There is still much more to see. Like how did McQueen start, where did he come from etc?
True, maybe what i mean is for Disney to do a reboot. I really however did like the new cars in Cars 3.
Yeah, all Tech No heart is what i say.
But you have to admit the entrance of that new guy left everybody stumped. What's his name again.
STORM! Yeah burst on the scene like nothing anyone expected futuristic car, fast and almost unstoppable.
Don't forget the scene with the demolition derby. For sure i thought something dramatic was going to happen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's one of your favorite Disney movies?
My all time favorite is The Little Mermaid.
Yeah, I like that one, my favorite is The Lion King.
That's a good one too. I also really enjoyed Aladdin when I was a kid.
Yeah, there are really some classic Disney movies out there.  Have you seen Mulan?
Yes, that's also a good one.
My kids love Frozen.
Mine too.  I like that the plot revolves around two sisters, it's a little different than other Disney movies.
Yes, it has a sweet story line I think.  My kids love the music and Olaf.
Yes, Olaf is a great character!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?
I finally saw it and thought it was really good. I loved the music.
Ya I really liked how they portrayed the Bell character.
She was probably my favorite character in the movie. I didn't really like The Beast though.
Ya I felt his character was lacking depth.
I kind of found him boring and thought he looked a little strange.
Ya I see what you mean I liked the cartoon beast better.
I did really like the other characters.
I liked how there was more back story of everyone else in the castle.
Ya like Miss Potts how you see her husband.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best of the modern Disney films?
I'd make a case for Finding Nemo.
That was a classic.
Truly. I think Albert Brooks really sold that movie.
He was awesome. But the whole cast was good.
Yeah, Willem Dafoe was Gill; he was excellent as always.
Right, and Allison Janey was Peach.
She has a very distinct voice.
That what makes for a great animated film. That and the writing.
It was some stirring stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite old school Disney film?
The Little Mermaid. It was my favorite growing up.
I loved that film.
You "loved" it? What happened?
I still love the music and all, but the message is sort of not my style anymore.
What do you mean?
Well, I'm a much bigger fan of the Disney films that show more women who are empowered and don't need a man.
Like Mulan and Moana?
Exactly. So The Little Mermaid has been overshadowed for me.
That makes a lot of sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of the actor who voiced the dog in Fox and the Hound?
The young dog or the older one?
The older one.
It was Kurt Russell.
Wow!  I thought he sounded familiar.
Yeah, I remember watching it and wondering where I've heard it before.
It makes sense.  I thought it sounded like him, but didn't for sure.
Kind of crazy really.  Who would have thought he would have voiced a Disney character?
That was long before he was popular.
I guess you could say maybe it launched his career.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's hard to believe that Disney movies now include Star Wars!
Yeah, my husband wasn't thrilled when news of that first broke.
I was a bit nervous about it too, but I think they have done a great job!
Me too! I loved what they did with A Force Awakens!
I did too! Rey and Finn had such an awesome rapport!
They really did! Ah, that movie was sweet, funny, exciting... it had everything that the original Star Wars: A New Hope was.
I cried when I saw it! I didn't expect to be so moved but, I was!
Me too... everything my husband said he felt about the original Star Wars was sort of how I felt about The Force Awakens.
Right?! It felt good to have an awesome character like Rey and I adored seeing that Princess Leia had become a general of all things!
Yes!! The movie really highlighted the multiple facets of women without being preachy. I loved that movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Atlantis the absolute bomb I think it was?
Yes it was a failure for the Disney empire.
Why do you think that was?
The material about what it was about was dumb.
Why do you say that?
I just dont think people care about water type films.
It was much more than that.
Yeah the plot was uninteresting for a major audience.
I think we have become dumber.
Disney needs to stick to cartoons though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the movie, 'Treasure Planet?'
I do! It's one of my favorites.
I know right, it's like no one remembers it though.
That's truely a shame, I mean the animation is-
Breathtaking!
Seriously!
All of the robotic parts are so intricately animated.
Yea, I think they used both 2D and 3D animation to pull that off.
Really?!
Yea, like with John Silver, his body was 2D but his cyborg parts were made in 3D.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast?
I like Beauty and the Beast best, I think. I love the songs in it, and I wish I could have a library like the one Beast gives Belle.
That library is amazing. The ballroom scene is really good, too.
Do you like Beauty and the Beast better, too, then?
No, I like it a lot, but I actually prefer The Little Mermaid.
That's surprising! How come?
I think that everything in it is so pretty!
That's true. I like the "Under the Sea" scene a lot.
I even like the song that Ursula sings, "Poor Unfortunate Souls"
I like it too, but her and her eels always scared me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Up the movie?
No but I heard about it.
You need to watch it.
Why is that?
It is so much more than a movie.
Please explain more.
It is uplifting and is the most positive movie.
Wow I like that.
Yes it is heartwarming and a great movie for giving positive feelings in the heart.
Wow that sounds great, thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for Cars 3 to come out.
I know, I loved the first two.
We should go, it comes out on June 16th.
For sure we will.  Who does the voices in it.
Owen Wilson is Lightning McQueen.
Oh that's right.
And Paul Newman was in it before he died.
Who did he play?
Doc Hudson.
Awesome.  I can't wait to go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Disney movie Moana yet?
Yes, and I absolutely loved it. how about you?
I took my niece out to see it a week ago. I think I was more into it then her.
Moana was such a breath of fresh air in regards to Disney movies.
I loved how they portrayed so much beautiful Polynesian culture and heritage.
Me too. I would top Moana as one of my favorites next to Disney's Brave. And I loved how they used the Rock as one of the voice actors.
Of course, he has a great voice and was well suited for Maui.
I cracked up with scenes with Maui and Moana's chicken. Could never get enough of those two. Do you think they will ever come out with a Moana 2?
I don't know, but I can hope. It seems they left a lot of story that could be told in a Moana sequel.
I couldn't agree more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know in Snow White, does she just break into a random house.
Yes.
And then doesn't she just act like its her house and sleeps in the first bed she finds despite the fact there are clearly already occupants.
Yes.
That's so rude.
Yeah but she was really tired and had a hard day running away from a homicidal witch.
True.
Something that did always bother me was how chilled the dwarves were to find a trespasser.
Didn't they just make her their maid or something.
Yeah that was really weird but it's not like she had anywhere else to go due to the aforementioned homicidal witch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the most recent Cars movie?
Yes, I can't wait to see it.
I know, I think the story is going to be even better than before.
I love the historical perspective and stuff it seems to have.
I wonder what new characters there will be?
I don't know. Hopefully more Doc. He was great!
I agree. I also love the racing scenes.
Good point. I think those are actually well done.
Do you think they still live in Radiator Springs?
I doubt it by now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
On the topic of villains, what about Cruella DeVille?
Best evil name ever!
Right? And she was totally evil.
Obviously - who could make a coat out of puppies?
Someone VERY concerned with fashion.
Heh, and the Dalmatians were just collateral damage?
That's a good way to look at it.
Maybe I have a career in super villainy.
Well, you just need to find some puppies to make your costume!
And maybe get a few henchmen too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney film?
I love The Little Mermaid.
Nice and my favorite is Cinderella.
There are so many to like.
Do you like the newer ones by Pixar?
Yes, I think they are great.
Which ones haven't you seen?
I have not seen Inside Out.
That one is really good. I recommend it.
I will watch it. I also need to see Frozen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love about every movie that Disney puts out
Oh yeah,me too
I always loved the movie Beauty and the beast
I don't remember liking that one
Really? well what about finding nemo?
Oh yeah,I really liked that one
My daughter has watched that one about 100 times already
Really? My little boy has watched the movie Cars about that many times
My daughter never watches cars but loves Cinderella
My little boy never got into Cinderella.I can't wait to see what else Disney will put out
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm fostering another litter of orphaned bottle fed kittens for the cat rescue I volunteer for.
Aw, you are so kind. I know it's got to be a lot of work. But I bet they are super cute.
Oh they're adorable. They are a lot of work. One of the hardest parts is naming them, and thinking up something cute that will attract attention.
So what did you name them?
I like to name them after characters from Disney movies, so hopefully they will attract families with kids who will play with them.
That's a great idea. And it gives you lots of possibilities for names.
Two of them are little grey tigers, a boy and girl, and I named them Kiara and Kovu, from The Lion King 2 Simba's pride.
Those are really unique names, they are sure to get attention!
The other two are grey and white girls, I named them Elsa from Frozen and Ariel from The Little Mermaid.
I'm sure you'll find some little girls who want to adopt kittens with names like those!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched Lilo & Stitch?
Yes! I watch it almost every month with my niece. She thinks I look like Nani.
I could totally see that! Isn't your niece a bit young to watch it since Lilo's parent's died?
No, I don't think that's the main point of the movie.
Well, what do you think the main point of the movie is?
Lilo & Stitch is about embracing family and showing them love! It's not about the absence of family.
True, I guess I never thought of it that way. I liked David in the movie, anyways.
Same here. He really became such an important person for Lilo and Nani.
That's why I liked him! I'll go watch the movie again tonight.
Mind if I come? I'll bring my Stitch plush!
XXXXXXXXXXX
In Aladdin do you think Ja'Far hated Aladdin or the Genie more?
I think Ja'Far hated everyone.
I think he was irritated by the Genie but I think he hated Aladdin.
What makes you come to that conclusion?
I don't think Ja'Far sees Genie as a threat because he thinks his magic is stronger.
That can happen when you are a narcissist.
Aladdin got under Ja'Far's skin though and I think it was because he was always happy.
Especially since he was a street urchin who had nothing.
I think Aladdin is one of my favorite movie.
I like Aladdin too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi Sara, i saw you at the movie theater last night.
Really? i was clueless, i didn't see you there.
No problem, i was with Mark, which movie did you watch?
Cars 3, it was awesome!
Omg, i watched too!
I really wasn't expecting the end to be honest with you.
I know right? It seems that this movie is more mature than the previous ones.
I totally agree with you.
McQueen will still be my favorite character!
Mine too, i hope there will be a 4th movie, i can't wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
Aladdin
Like, that older 90's movie?
Yea!!
Why?
Genie!
Oh, a Robin Williams fan?
All the way!
Yea he's awesome!
I couldnt agree more!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you enjoy Moana?
I really liked Moana. I liked the animation and the songs a lot.
My favorite scenes in Moana were at the beginning when she's still a baby. That beach scene with the baby turtle was really cute.
I loved that scene! When she flips over the baby turtle and then shields it into the ocean with that big leaf.
I don't hear people talking a lot about Moana but it was a really good Disney movie!
The Rock was really good in it too!
I didn't know the Rock could sing, other than doing silly karaoke singing.
Maui! The Rock was really good as that character. It was a very fun Disney adventure movie.
The animation was fantastic! The ocean looked so realistic.
I liked those little coconut guys. The Kakamora! I thought they were really adorable too but overall fantastic Disney movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like to watch Disney moves?
Of course, they are some of the best movies out there!
Are you familiar with The Incredibles?
Yes, I watched the first one and it was great.  My kids loved it!
Have you heard about the sequel?
No, are they making a part 2?
Yes, but it's coming out in 2019.
That's so far away!
Yeah, it's a long ways away but at least the kids have something to look forward to.
This is true, my kids will be pleased.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Disney's Sleeping Beauty?
Yes, of course. It's a classic.
I just love the music in it so much.
Have you heard the soundtrack to the live version of the movie?
Lana Del Rey's cover? Yes. It's so pretty and eerie.
I loved Maleficent.
I liked her better when she was evil to be petty rather than due to a tragic backstory.
Yes, but it has to make money doesn't it?
But if I know you, I know what you'll dooo. You'll love me at once, the way you did once -
Upon a dream.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know national treasure was a disney movie
I did not know that
I love that movie
Me too its so interesting.
And nicolas cage is a great actor
He is, hes perfect for that movie
I wish they came out with another one
Maybe they ran out of secrets
Thats possible
Or secrets they wanted us to know
XXXXXXXXXXX
Darby O'Gill and the Little People is so underrated!
It was a pretty fantastic film.
Sean Connery sings!
You can't top that!
Did he do any other Disney?
Not that I am aware of.
That was really the golden age of Disney.
I agree. Grew up on all those old films.
Me too. Disney should get back to their roots.
They're making too much money now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw on Facebook that you watched Inside Out last night.
Oh yea. I loved it.
Yea me too. I think the message is so great. It's telling kids it's okay to be sad sometimes.
Yea definitely. It's going to be one of the first movies I watch with my kids for sure.
Yea. I just hope they don't confuse me with Bing Bong. We have the same taste in clothes.
I loved Bing Bong! You definitely dress like him.
I don't smell like cotton candy like him.
There's probably perfume that smells like that.
I loved Riley in the movie too.
Yea I wish I could play hockey like her. She was really cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for Cars 3?
Not really. I am not a fan of the first two. You?
What, you are kidding me! The Cars movies are so fun!
I'm not really sure, they just didn't pique my interest. I have heard Cars 3 is better than the second one though.
I think it has a chance to even be the best, from what I've heard.
I will probably see it when it comes to video. Are you going to see it in the theater?
I will definitely go to the theater. I might even wear Mickey ears!
Haha, you are so silly. Who is your favorite character?
Mater! He makes me laugh.
I don't get Mater. I just don't think he's funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what was the first Disney movie you ever saw as a kid?
Oh, the Little Mermaid was the first.
Really, why that one?
It was my birthday and my mom took me to see it in the theater.
That's cool. Is it your favorite Disney movie then?
Most definitely. I love the songs.
Kiss the Girl is a classic.
It is, lots of musicians like to cover it.
Do you like the villain?
Ursula is my queen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I got a cool fact.
What's that?
Can you guess how many movies Disney has made in total?
In total? It has got to be alot.
Yeah, it is, but can you give a ballpark estimate?
I don't know, maybe three a year for the past seventy years. So like 210?
That's not a bad guess. From the information I just read online, they have made at least 161.
Wow! I wonder how many of those I've seen.
Yeah, I've probably seen two or three new Disney movies for each year of my life. So probably around fifty.
That sounds right. I hadn't realized how many I had seen until you pointed that out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks?
Oh my gosh yes! That was from some time ago.
Yes it was. It is one of my favorites.
Its a good one.  What did you like about it?
The cast, the story, the animation, and music.
Yeah it was definitely original.
Almost like a Broadway play.
Well I think Angela Lansbury was a stage actress too.
So she brought that feel, I think.
I would say so. Now I'm feeling nostalgic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Bambi was such a good movie, it was really sad though
I know , I hated it when the forest caught on fire
the part when his mother was shot was horrible, I am glad he found friends
Thumper was my favorite, he was so cute! I liked his mom also
the graphics were older but they were so pretty , it is a classic.
It really is, I do not own many movies but I do own this one.
I am glad that Bambi grew up and was such a strong deer
I know, he had a good life. This movie always makes me cry
He was a cute little deer though, with his spots!
I know, baby deer always have spots, I did not know this until I watched this movie when I was a kid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the trailer of 'Beauty and the Beast'?
Yes, the effects were pretty cool.
Emma Watson looked beautiful as ever.
Even, I am in complete awe of Dan Stevens' acting as The Prince/Beast.
Where is the plot based?
I think it's based in Pre-revolution France.
Cool! Are you planning to watch it?
Yes. Let's book the tickets.
It's releasing on 17th March. I have booked 2 tickets.
I am so excited already.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I like Hunchback of Notre Dame.
I like that one too. It's a pretty intense movie for kids, no?
I know right? What with it talking about lust, genocide, murder, and all that.
I guess they expect those things to just fly over kid's heads.
I know right? Just focus on the singing gargoyles.
Plus they did make the ending less depressing. Everyone dies in the original version.
I know, they did that with The Little Mermaid too.
Yeah that's another one that ends on a pretty depressing note in the original.
I guess it makes sense they had to change these things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your take on Hayley Mills movies?
They're kind of a gas, aren't they?
I'll say.  Which one do you like best?
Disney's The Parent Trap.  So funny!
I liked that one too.  It was cool how they did the twin characters with I think split screens.
She was cute as a teen.
Poor thing, just trying to get her parents back together.
She meant well, but lots of shenanigans happened.
The story had a good ending.
Things got tied back together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Moana is on netflix?
It is? I love that movie!
I think i like it better than Frozen
I don't know, I like them equally
I also really liked Tangled too
Oh yeah that was a great movie
Was that a Disney movie?
You know I am not sure
I do know Brave is good, I love ther heroine
Yes, one of the best!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Jack Sparrow is getting too old?
What do you mean?
In the most recent movie, he looked... old.
Yeah.  People age.
You know what I mean.  It seems like Johnny Depp is just getting a bit old.
He's like 50-something.  Of course he's going to look older.
I was just expecting him to do more stunts and stuff.
When you're 50, I doubt you'll be jumping around.
I'll be sitting on my couch watching Johnny Depp do it instead.
Oh brother.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember  tomorrowland?
oh yes, I went there once in Disneyworld
well, I'm talking about the movie
I have seen the movie too, brilliant movie. It makes me admire Disney even more, such a visionary
I can't agree more. It's just amazing how he made all his dreams to come true, and his dreams are carried on by his successors
yeah, talking about Tomorrowland, I wish I could have a pin that would teleport me to a different reality
that would be awesome, wouldn't it
well I could do it today
how?
in my dream
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really think Disney waited too long when they made Cars 3.
Yeah, it's like they create a movie, and then a decade later they make a sequel!
I totally agree! Anyways, who do you hate the most in Hercules?
Honestly, I'll have to go with Meg, hands down. She was a stereotypical epitome of a damsel in distress, and she was as skinny as a twig!
I agree. She looked really fragile, i was kind of afraid her hair might weigh her down!
Ha ha ha! Well, who was your favorite character in Hercules?
I think Phil was my favorite character, he was really helpful to Hercules and he never gave up on him.
Yeah, Phil was pretty cool.
Pretty cool?! TOTALLY COOL, more like it!!
I guess so...
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, ever since Disney took over Star Wars, they've been doing a lot with it.
Star Wars is a popular series. People remember it from when they were kids and they're kind of banking on that to draw people in.
I guess...
I mean, look at the newer stuff with Rey and all. They kind of redid the old stuff by having history repeat itself.
I see what you mean, but it's still kind of about how people can work together to make good things happen if they believe.
Well, yeah, that and the thing with Kylo Ren and Darth Vader and Han Solo.
I miss Carrie Fisher.
Oh, she was amazing. I miss her, too.
Gotta love Princess Leia.
Yeah, gotta love Princess Leia.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Parent Trap?
The one with Lindsay Lohan and Dennis Quaid?
No, the original one with Maureen O'Hara, Brian Keith, and Hailey Mills.
I didn't know there was another version.  How is it?
I liked it better than the remake, but then in most cases, the originals tend to be better.
That's true.  So what was your favorite part of the movie?
I think the camping trip where they got rid of the fiancée.  Putting honey on Vicky so that the bear licked her feet was really funny.
Honey on her feet?  That's kind of mean, isn't it?
I guess so, but it was really funny.  I just really liked the whole thing.
I guess maybe I'll have to watch it because the part you described to me sounds really funny.  Mean, but funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to come with me?
Where are you going?
"Under da sea, man"
That is funny, I love that song. Sebastian is one of my favorite characters.
I think he's in mostly everybody's top ten.
And it's because of that song.
Well that and kiss the girl.
Oh yeah, that one is pretty great too.
I wish I could live down there with them.
Who wouldn't? Everything better, down where it wetter, take it from me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy Disney movies?
Oh yes, I do for sure. My favorite is The Lion King.
I agree. The Lion King has to be one of my all time favorites too.
The movie sends such powerful messages to the audience, and it's followed my a fantastic soundtrack too.
Yeah, the songs are what really did it for me. "Can you feel the love tonight" gives me shivers every time I hear it.
My favorite was "Circle Of Life". The scene so beautifully portrays a new dawn and the beginning of a new life.
I loved that scene too. One of the most powerful ones in the movie for sure.
It is. It shows us how everything in nature and in life is so well connected.
It's a sad movie too though. It's one of the rare movies that drives me to tears.
Me too. No matter how many times I see it, I still cry at the scene of Mufasa's death.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Doesn't that guy over there kind of remind you of that guy from Mulan?
General Li Shang? Yea, I can see it a little.
I just picture him singing "How could I make a man out of you!"
I love that song! And the whole montage where Mulan got her act together... Amazing!
Yes! I feel like she was the first Disney heroine I could really relate to.
Except impersonating a soldier and having to present yourself in front of a matchmaker!
True, but that would have definitely been me if I was in her shoes. I'm such a clutz!
She was in trouble from the start though. The matchmaker was not a pleasant woman.
Well like Grandma said, "Who spit in her bean curd?"
My sentiments exactly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Black Panther?
I do, Its one of my favorite Marvel heroes.
And did you know about hes upcoming movie?
I did actually but im not sure when its coming to theaters.
I heard it was coming our next year so theres still a bit of time left.
I liked Black Panther´s introduction in the las Captain America movie.
Yeah he was pretty cool and with good fighting moves.
I loved the ending scene where you can see hes home.
I liked that part as well I thought it was a good element to spice things up for the movie.
I liked the costume the most, it was pretty good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I really like Inside Out.
Me too. I thought it was very well done.
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I love the Little Mermaid, always have, always will.
That was a cute story too.
Did you see they're making a live action mermaid movie?
I did, I don't think its going to be The Little Mermaid that you remember though.
Oh, I know that, but it still looks good.
I think it looks really dark, but I still want to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I liked the remake of Beauty and the Beast.
Oh, I loved it! Emma Watson is like a cartoon come to life.
It was actually scarier than the cartoon.
Yes, but I really liked the clock that the Dad made.
And I don't remember the book that transports people in the cartoon.
Me either!  And Gaston was so much more evil in this one!
I don't want them to remake the Lion King with people.
I saw the Broadway show, though, and it wasn't bad.
But in a movie, that's different. Come on, people in masks?
It may be CGI!  Let's hope.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie The Princess and the Frog?
No, never heard of it.
The Disney movie, you never heard of it?
No. Is it an old one?
Not even ten years old.
Well, I had boys. No girls to watch princess movies.
It was a cute musical. Took place in New Orleans.
Really, that's a new concept.
Yes, the music and setting for the movie was really a different idea for a change.
Not set out in a castle in the woods. Maybe someday I'll see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
Can I include Marvel movies?
No just the animated ones.
Oh ok, then probably Cinderella.
Wow thats a shocker.
I know most people dont say that huh
I think its a classic
I think so too
Well sometimes people tend to gravitate towards the more recent movies
Yeah but I love the classics
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever regretted taking your kid to see a Disney movie?
No, why? Have you?
Yes, my son is 8 now, but he is still scared from a movie he saw at a noon showing a couple years ago- Finding Nemo.
Oh, all the big fish trying to eat everyone?
Yes. My husband was talking about a friend's aquarium he admired, and said he'd really like to get one for the living room, and my son threw a fit.
Oh my. Maybe he would learn it's not so scary if you just got a few nice fish?
Well, fish do eat each other sometimes, and they die really easily, so I told my husband it would be too traumatic.
Is your son still really sensitive about that?
We had to leave during the movie because he started crying when Marlin's wife and their eggs were eaten, and then with the big fish with all the teeth, he kept crying and saying he didn't like it, so we left.
No, I guess an aquarium would not be a good idea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Pinocchio good?
It is one of the finest movies of Disney
Is it suspenseful?
Yes. Especially with the whale.
Is it scary?
Yes. There are some frightening parts.
Like what?
The scene at Pleasure Island is very scary
What happens?
The kids turn into donkeys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have a confession.
What's wrong?
I'm kind of a Disney princess fanatic.
What's wrong with that?
Sometimes I feel weird admitting that as a guy.
It's 2017, don't let social standards deter you.
I'm kind of a SUPER fan though.
Oh, Who's your favorite princess?
I gotta say Elsa from frozen, she's a newer character but already one of the most complex.
That's an amazing choice!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard Moana is a good movie
Yeah I saw it and thoroughly enjoyed it
youtube had a song sung by Dwayne Johnson and got my attention
I have the blu ray disc you want it?
Wow I was about to buy one
I have almost all the disney movie collections,they are fun to watch even repeatedly
yeah especially the one with more songs
Ha Ha! who does not love disney songs
eagerly waiting for pirates of the Caribbean 5 blu ray release
Do not forget to lend me when you get it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Our topic today is: If you could remake any animated Disney movie what would you suggest they take on next?
How many choices do we get?
We each get three. I'll go first: The Rescuers as I see it as being a surprising hit, The Black Cauldron will totally cash in on the whole fantasy genre Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit left open, and A Goofy Movie because Goofy really needs to make a comeback after all these years.
Not sure how I feel about a live action Goofy movie but here's my choices: Toy Story because it seems to be one of the core 90s kids movies and has a lot of potential, Hunchback of Notre Dame would actually be the next surprise hit, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire for similar reasons as you choosing The Black Cauldron plus Atlantis hasn't gotten much love in modern society so it's something different.
Oh Atlantis is a good choice! I forgot about that.
My best friend exposed me to it and it's quickly become one of my favorites. I found the sequel to be extremely disappointing however.
That's true about most sequels whether they're animated or not. I just hate it when any company feels the need to unnecessarily make a sequel or prequel just to cash in on a classic - it almost ruins the original every time.
Think Empire Strikes Back is the exception to the rule.
I wouldn't mind a sequel to A Nightmare Before Christmas if Tim Burton was in control though. Team him up with Neil Gaiman and I promise you it'll be the movie of the year.
That would be a dream come true, but can you imagine a live action remake with Burton and Depp. Those two are a power couple when it comes to movies just look at the live action Alice In Wonderland Sweeney Todd.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, so Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first Disney movie to come out, but what was the first Disney Pixar movie?
I believe it was Toy Story.
That makes sense, I know that came out in 1995 because I was six years old.
Yeah, that sounds about right and i for sure can't remember anything coming out made by Disney-Pixar before Toy Story.
Good point. I also remember it being three dimensional and innovative at the time.
Yeah, I take that for granted now that three dimensional animation wasn't always a thing.
Definitely a game changer.
Definitely. The whole brand of Pixar is premised on that style of animation.
I guess that's right, huh?
Yeah, regular Disney movies can be animated or non-animated in a number of ways. Pixar's movies tend to be three dimensional animation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney song ?
Are you serious , there are so many !!
I think I would say mine would be a song from Mulan!
Is it I'll make a man out of you?
Yes! How did you know ?!?
Everyone is obsessed with that scene and song in the movie.
I find it so inspiring!
I do too, especially when she climbs the pole !
That part is amazing !
We really need to watch Mulan like right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Up was such a great movie.
A lot of people liked that movie. It draws you in so quickly, too.
Yes. It was actualy kind of emotional watching that first bit where they run through the man's entire life, and losing his wife.
That was a well-done clever bit to develop the plot really quickly.
Oh, yeah. I remember that was how we learned about why he decided to go on his trip.
Then that little kid showed up unexpectedly on the porch.
That was so funny! I remember he knocks on the front door when the house is in mid-air.
It was an endearing movie. I guess I just felt a little confused towards the end.
What do you mean?
Well, it just kind of seemed like the talking-dog invention and some other stuff came a bit out of nowhere at the end of the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One Disney film with a good true-to-life character is Pocahantas.
I totally agree.  She is a good role model.
I'm glad Disney made this movie.  It shows a solid female character.
Yeah, like Mulan.
Right.  They moved past the heroine in distress.
I like how Pocahantas was so tied into nature.
Yes it was great how she educated John Smith in that area.
Especially in that era.
The "Colors of the Wind" song played all over at the time.
I thought it was so pretty.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember what that movie was called where the family gets shipwrecked on an island and builds a really cool treehouse?
I think you mean Swiss Family Robinson.
Yes. It's a really old movie but I thought it was fun to watch how the family worked together to make the best of the situation.
The carnival day where they all race on exotic animals they've found on the island was hilarious.
But remember that also was the day the pirates landed and they had to defend their home.
That was kind of scary but also very exciting.
Have you heard if Disney is going to do a re-make of Swiss Family Robinson?
There's been quite a bit of talk about that but nothing definitive.
Where had the Robinson family originally been traveling to?
New Guinea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that movie that had the dinosaur in it?
Dinosaur?
Well, that was a Disney movie, but the other dinosaur movie?
I think you're thinking of The Good Dinosaur.
Yep, that's the one.  It was quite good, don't you think?
I liked it.  I wasn't expecting much, but enjoyed the story.
I'm not sure why some dinosaurs had human eyes and others didn't.
Guess they wanted to show a more human side of those creatures.
Yeah, was just a bit weird to see, that's all.
The movie was still a good time though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear they made a live-action film of Jungle Book?
Yes, the movie came out in 2016.
The movie had some big name actors in it.
Who was in the movie?
Idris Alba played Shere Khan; Christopher Walken played King Louie; and Scarlett Johansson played Kaa.
Scarlett Johansson was in the film?
She voiced Kaa, the enormous python in the film.
I remember the snake. It had the crazy eyes.
I thought Neel Sethi portrayed Mowgli well.
He is bound to have a good acting career if he sticks with it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Isn't it weird that Disney owns Marvel now?
It is!
Guardians of the Galaxy was technically a Disney movie!
the best movie they've done, honestly
certainly the least family friendly, at least
it's really cool, though. two huge parts of nerd culture coming together.
the cartoon nerds and the comic nerds
exactly! it was bound to happen
disney is doing a good job with it's comic book movies, too
i'm surprised, yeah
XXXXXXXXXXX
I used to have some respect for disney.
Oh, tell me about it, these live action remakes are soul killing.
Beauty and the beast was just awful.
I really hope they quit this trend.
You know they wont.
Yeah, I shouldnt hold my breath.
I hope they at least leave mulan alone.
Oh man that was my favorite movie!
They are going to ruin it for sure.
I just can't deal.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Moana?
Yes, it was great! I loved it!
Me too! What was your favorite part?
I think my favorite scene was the song with the turtle. What was yours?
Mine was towards the end when Moana was returning the heart back to Ne Fiti.
That was a great scene, especially the slow motion part.
I really want to watch it again. Did you have a favorite character?
I did. I really loved Hei Hei, the chicken.
That chicken was hilarious! I really loved Maui.
Maui was great. The Rock did an awesome job voicing his part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I saw Cars 3 today?
And?
I can't figure out why they keep making these things.
Boys seem to like them more.
Yeah, but they just don't have the magic of the other Pixar films
That's true, but at least it was better than Cars 2.
Yeah, that was horrible.  Probably worst Pixar movie ever.
With the exception of Up.
Up?  You're crazy!
Nope, just opinionated!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You're stranded on a desert island and can only have one Disney movie to watch forever. What is it?
The Incredibles.
Why The Incredibles? What about the others?
I like the classics too, but The Incredibles are my favorite.
What makes The Incredibles worthy of being the only Disney movie you'll ever watch again?
Like I said I like the other movies too, but I like the story of The Incredibles the best.
I'll be honest, I don't remember much about that movie.
It's the movie about the family with superpowers.
Oh right. That's the movie about the retired heroes that take down the giant robot.
Yeah, that's the one. It has more action than the others so that's why I like it the most.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I really like Mulan.
Me too! I love the story of Mulan.
Same, I think it's amazing how she is a Disney princess that is a warrior.
I like the message that women can do whatever they set their minds to, as well.
Yes, she definetely challenges gender roles in the movie and I think that's amazing.
Did you ever see the sequel to Mulan?
Yeah, I thought Mulan 2 was cute too but nowehere near the original!
Agreed, she's a great role model for children though.
Yes, what a great princess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The Incredibles?
I have, it's one of my favorite Disney movies.
Mine too. I wish they would make a second one.
I thought they were?
No, I don't think so. What other Disney movies do you like?
Cinderella is my favorite.
The song, "So this is love" is beautiful.
I like that too. When they're dancing it plays. Seems romantic.
The wicked Stepmother was awful.
She was, and so were Anastasia and Drizzella. And that awful cat Lucifer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lilo and stitch is so cute
I think it is funny
Oh it is funny without a shadow of a doubt
Honestly i am surprised they pulled it off
I know right
The setting and story all good
And really adorable
Quite so
I want to watch it now
lets do
XXXXXXXXXXX
What ever happened to Rick Moranis?
I think he walked away to raise his family.
That's comendable.
The last thing I remeber him in is the "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" movies.
I loved those growing up.
Yeah, he was pretty funny.
I noticed he didn't do a cameo in Ghost Busters.
He was about the only one.
Ha! Not even Moranis could have saved that stinker!
All too true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There is so much talk about disney putting hidden messages or things in the movies. Have you noticed any?
I have in fact.
Like what? I have never seen anything at all!
Well the original vhs in the little mermaid had one. The priest at the end has noticable movement in his crotch area.
What, really? Are you certain?
Yes completely. It is there on it. Not sure if they changed it for DVD or later releases.
It is so bizarre they would do that at all.
I agree, also the dust in aladdin in one scene is said to spell the word sex.
I thought it was allegedly the genie saying something inappropriate when he was a bee.
I heard that one too. I think it is a little bit of a stretch but I can sort of hear it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about movies
Great
I love disney movies
Me too
I liked that cinderella movie
Which one?
The one with selena gomez
I love that one
One of my favorites
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in Tarzan?
Oh Jane, obviously.
Why do you like Jane so much?
I like how she finally realizes that true happiness is with Tarzan and becomes one of the apes basically.
Well wasn't Tarzan important in making her realize that?
Yeah, but Jane was the one who had to actually make the hard choice, and she did.
That's true. I really like that funny little ape who Rosie O'Donnel plays.
Yeah she's a really funny character in that movie.
How do you think they slid on those trees with their bare feet?
I have no clue! It would have hurt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wreck-It Ralph was the first Disney movie about video games.
I know. I'm so glad they finally made a movie about video games.
So many fans are represented in that movie, like classics players and new gamers.
I really like how Disney thought out the inside of the gaming machines so well.
What was really cool was how Ralph traveled through different games.
Yeah that was neat, but the best part was that he finally succeeding in something.
Right, I agree.
A movie that can teach kids they can succeed is always important.
And succeeding in video games is one way they can do that!
Well, maybe...
XXXXXXXXXXX
which pixar disney movie do you like best?
thats so hard to pick
i know. they always make classic movies.
we are only talking about pixar movies owned by disney?
yes so no toy story 1.
okay, ill say toy story 3.
yooo, that made me feel so many emotions.
it was so sad.
i may like it better than toy story 1 or 2.
me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why don't you like Disney movies?
Because they're bad influences on our children, that's why!
How on Earth are they bad influences?
Cinderella stayed out all night with a man she didn't know, Snow White shacked up with SEVEN men she didn't know, and Tiana was kissing on animals.
Okay, it was totally different back in their times. And Tiana didn't go kissing on animals, just one frog!
Like that makes it better?
He was a talking frog, and he told her he was a prince. He told her a kiss would set him free.
Okay? That still doesn't make it okay. He could've just been a talking frog who was lying to her.
That's true. But what is life if you don't take chances?
I suppose. But nothing would ever make ME kiss a frog!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know about the national treasure movie series?
Yes i watch the 2004 movie but later part I didn't remember
Seriously you should watch the movie it is full of thriller and adventorous
Yes I love the first part I will watch the other parts also
Nicholas Cage acting is mind blowing, did you remember his stunt in the movie
Yes that was so awesome I love that scene when he dive theu the building, he is a hero
And also a cryptologist is such a genius he can crack any code
The last code seems quite difficult but the logic is sees correct in the movie
It is most adventurous movie I love this
Yes the movie is fully adventurous not a single minute I feel bore when watching this movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
They are remaking so many Disney movies and turning them into live action ones.
I thought Beauty and The Beast was good, as well as Cinderella.  So I am feeling pretty optimistic about it.
I wasn't too in to The Jungle Book though, it was kind of dark for a children's movie.
The way Sher Kan killed the wolf pack leader caught me off guard. And I'm not even a kid.
Yeah that surprised me too.  But I think they made some positive changes in other movies.
I loved how they changed Le Fou in Beauty and the Beast.
I read that they kind of had to, because in the cartoon he got beat up a lot but in a cartoonish way that did't translate to real life.
It definitely improved his character in my opinion to have him switch sides.
I agree, he had more depth and he was more relatable.
I almost liked Gaston in the beginning, he seemed pretty sincere.  But then halfway through he went back to the Gaston that I am used to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Cinderella Disney movies?
Cinderella is a Disney classic but there are so many versions out there.
Are all the versions made by Disney?
I believe most are made by Disney and others by major companies.
What is your best version of the Disney Cinderella?
I think all of them are good and can't pick a favorite.
They all have a stepmom and two step sisters.  What happened to the father?
I think the father passes away early in all the films.
What about the stepmom in Cinderella?  Did she ever get remarried?
No, I thing the stepmom stayed single and just harassed Cinderella.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why did they auto-tune Belle so much in the last movie?
What do you mean?
I'm talking about how they destroyed Emma Watson's voice
Maybe she wasn't a good singer to begin with.
Well, destroyed isn't the right word.  Just made it sound too fake.
Yeah, because she's not a good singer.
She obviously had to be able to sing to some degree to get the role.
I'm not saying she's horrible, but she doesn't have the pipes.
Other than that, she was okay though.
Her performance was pretty good.  Helps that she's so pretty.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Brave in theater?
No. I bought it on Blu Ray though
Cool
I love the story
Yeah. That girl is very strong.
Do you remember her name?
Merida?
Yes
She was really good with the bow.
Yeah and she had a good sense of humor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seen any Disney movies recently?
I saw Ice Princess.
Isn't Kim Cattral in that?
Yes she is. Michelle T is in it as well.
What is that movie about again?
It is about a girl who wants to make it to the Olympics.
Oh interesting. But doesn't she not know how to skate initially.
Yeah she does not know how but she learns.
Sounds idealistic.
Yeah it is definitely unrealistic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seen any good Disney movies recently?
Yeah I saw Pocohantas.
Oh that movie is wonderful. I miss that movie.
Me too. I hadn't seen it since I was a kid.
Is that your favorite disney movie?
Yes for sure.
I miss Toy Story 2.
That movie is also amazing. I love Tim Allen in that.
Tim is hilarious.
I also think Tom Hanks does a great job.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Disney movie Beauty and the Beast with real people as characters?
When did that one come out?
It came out about about three months ago.
I think it came out on March 12, 2017.
Did you see it? or planning to see it?
Yes, I am planning to see it.  Who are the real actors/actresses?
Emma Watson plays the part of Belle.
Who is the Beast?
I think Luke Evans or Dan Stevens is the Beast.  I can't remember which one plays the Beast.
Great-I loved the animated Beauty and the Beast.  I am looking forward to seeing this one with real people as the characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the GIF going around with the guy from Pocahontas?
You mean the Kocoum running GIFs? Yeah they're pretty hilarious!
It's been so long since I've seen Pocahontas. Do you remember that scene?
Yeah, that's the scene where Kocoum was following Pocahontas and he finds her secretly meeting with John Smith.
Right! And he sees them kiss and loses it!
Then Thomas, who was following John Smith ends up shooting Kocoum.
That was so sad! I know he was just following orders but that was so disappointing.
He eventually makes up for it though by standing up to Ratcliffe.
I heard Christian Bale played Thomas.
I didn't know that! But I did know Mel Gibson played John Smith.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the best Disney movie ever made?
I think Moana is the best one ever
That's really recent though
What's wrong with that?
We'll have to see if it becomes a classic or if it goes away slowly
I really like how cool it is and how catchy the songs are
I think they paid a lot of famous celebs to appear in it and to make it popular
Well that's your opinion, What's your favorite then?
I like the original Cinderella, she's the reason the Disney castle is famous!
True, I too like the classic Disney princesses with dresses and castles
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Beauty and the Beast
Yes I did. What did you think of Emma Watson as Belle
I like her, thought she did a great job
I can't picture her as Belle.
Yeah I do think of Harry Potter when I see her
Cinderella was better as it wasn't a well known actress
Yes I could really imagine her as Cinderella
Although Angelina Jolie rocked as Maleficent
She sure did, I think that's my favorite Disney movie.
Not me, my favorite is Cinderella.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what was the name of red hair girl in The Little Mermaid?
I think her name is Arial.
Arial was the fish wasn't it?
Nope i'm almost a hundred percent sure that Arial was the name of the main character.
Hey when you think about it Arial was a fish so I am technically right.
No she was a mermaid not a fish there's a difference.
Oh come on she had a fish tail and breathed under water.
But she did have a human top half so I think it's still different
How about we agree to disagree on that.
Nope you are wrong she is and never was a fish.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My kids will not stop watching Aladdin.
Oh, I love that movie.
They sing along to "Never Had a Friend Like Me" over and over again.
It must be funny seeing them try to do all the different Robin William's voices.
My youngest one pets the screen every time Raja comes on.
Is that the tiger?
Yeah, and she loves Abu, too.
I always thought Aladdin was kind of cute.
what? That so funny.  He is a cartoon character.
I meant if he was a real life person, obviously.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of drugs is Disney currently on?
What do you mean?
Have you seen how they are taking all their old cartoons and making them live action?
Yeah, and they look scary.
The Beauty and The Beast live action movie looks terrifying.
I wonder if they will do a live action Aladdin.
They did a live action Jungle Book.
That movie looked messed up.
If they redo Aladdin they I will be pissed.
You ready for cgi Robin Williams!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember The Sword and the Stone?
I remember seeing it when I was young.
Did you realize how old it was?
I was figuring it was from the 70s.  Is that right?
It was released in the early 60s!
Oh, that must have been why my mom liked watching it with me.
Yeah, she probably watched it when she was a kid.
Probably so, and they didn't have VCRs so I bet she hadn't seen it in years.
Probably not.  And then with VCRs we were watching things from the 60s.
Yeah, and even earlier.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have always been a big fan of Disney movies, either animated or live action. How about you?
Absolutely. To be honest, I don’t know many people who aren’t fans.
Do you have a favorite Disney movie?
Probably The Lion King. I loved that movie growing up.
What about that movie really stood out to you?
Not only was it just a great family movie, it had an amazing voice cast, and just a great story.
I absolutely agree. I also felt it had some darker elements for a Disney movie, which makes it a bit more appealing to adults.
That is true, also. The story had some adult elements, which I think was a risk that paid off.
And this goes without saying, but, the sequels did not live up to the original?
Unfortunately, no, I just didn’t think the spark was there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Cinderella's fairy god mother
She came just in the nick of time
If you had a fairy god mother, what would you want her to do for you
If she could dress me up and get me into an exclusive party, that would be awesome
I would love her to take me to a real ball in a real castle
It would be a good event to host, if you had a castle
I could use a fairy god mother to show me how to dress
It's hard to keep up with fashion
the god mother wasn't dressed very fancy
No
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does Disney have any Christmas movies
Yeah they have a few
Which ones would you recommend for my child?
Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas is such a lovely film
Does it star Mickey Mouse?
He is in it, but it has short stories from Donald and Goofy as well.
Short stories?
Yeah, each character has their own take on a classic christmas tale
What is Mickey's story about?
His is based off of Gift of the Magi
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember watching the Lion King?
I remember going to the theater as a kid.
Do you remember much from the actual movie?
Not a lot other than some of Simba's experiences.
I watched it recently.
How was it.
It is so great to watch a movie as an adult that I only saw as a kid.
What was it like.
It was like watching a new movie, I really enjoyed it.
Interesting, I will probably give it a watch, thank you for mentioning it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana yet?
Yes. I actually saw it last week.
What did you think?
It was okay. I really like the music.
Me too! I like the music number Dwayne Johnson did with Maui.
That was catchy. I think my favorite has to be the one with the big crab.
Are you referring to Tamatoa, when Moana and Maui went down in the to the underworld?
Yes, that's the one. I'm shiny!
Yeah, that's a really catchy tune as well.
Jemaine Clement did a great job with that song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Be our guest, be our guest, put our service to the test...
What are you talking about?
You know... that scene from Beauty and the Beast where Lumiere starts singing and dancing during dinner?
Oh yer, I remember that now.
If that was me and I was magically turned in to a spoon I would be disappointed.
What would you rather have been turned in to?
I don't know.... probably Mrs Potts because I would never be thirsty!
I would be the beast myself, it wouldn't bother me that I was ugly.
But he almost gets killed by Gaston at the end!
Yes, almost but he eventually gets the girl!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello
Got any plans
I am not sure
Well why dont you look
Sure thing i will
Please do
I am free
Wanna come over to watch the toy story movies
Sure thing it would be fun
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what is your favorite disney movie?
Hmm that's is tough. I have tons of favorite! Let me think. I would say Up!
Why is that?
I just love the story. The old man reminded me of my granpa. I miss him so much everytime I watch that movie.
Yea, the Up is a really great movie. One of the best one.
How about you? What is your favorite disney movie?
Zootopia!
Ah that is a fun movie! I love that movie too!
I know right? It is funny and adorable.
Especially the sloth! You can't forget that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched the movie Follow Me Boys?
Yes, I saw it when I was growing up. It has a young Kurt Russell in it, right?
Yes, and it also has Fred MacMurray and Vera Miles.
That's right, he was a traveling with a band and the bus stops in a small town. He decides to stay there.
He gets a job in the general store. He starts a Boy Scout troop for the kids in town.
Vera Miles works in the bank and after a while she realizes she likes him and they eventually fall in love.
Yes, and Kurt Russell plays the son of the town drunk.
His Dad dies and he's adopted by Fred MacMurray and Vera Miles.
It's interesting because Fred and Vera find out they can't have children so they consider the scout troop their children.
It's a really good story, and it kind of gives a history of the Boy Scouts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The thing is the way disney abuses sequels can lead to a bad thing
What can it lead to
Well it can lead to people being bored
Why would they get bored
Fatigue pretty much
Fatigue?
Yeah they wear it down so much by repetition
I guess that makes sense
Exactly
Yeah
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you ever watched Toy Story?
Which one?
Uh... The first one.
Oh, yeah I've seen it like a million times!
Cool! Which character is your favorite?
That's hard, I really like Buzz and Woody!
I like Mr. Potato Head.
He's funny and his wife.
Yep, To infinity...
...and beyond!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last Disney movie you've seen.
Huh, well I saw that live action Beauty and the Beast movie the other day.
Oh yeah! With Emma Watson, how was it?
Well I've never seen the animated film, but I really enjoyed it. And it was so star studded.
Who's in it?
Well for one, Ian McKellen. Also Stanley Tucci, Ewan McGregor, and Emma Thompson.
Woah, that's a lot of the great british actors, and obviously Emma Watson to boot! I gotta see it!
I really would, and also Josh Gad is always a plus in any movie.
You're so right, Frozen would have been unbearable without Count Olaf!
Hahahaha wrong series my friend! He was just Olaf the snowman.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what year Sleeping Beauty came out?
No, can't say that I do.
It came out in 1959.
Wow, I wasn't even born yet.
Me either.
I do like that one. It is a classic.
Yes, her parents were smart to hide her.
Most characters in their stories don't think of the worst.
Well guess it didn't matter anyway, did it?
No, but as usual it all works out in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you have a favorite Pixar film
probably wall e
there are so many good ones to choose from
yeah but wall e spoke to me
how so?
the isolation and the post apocalyptic world
you like that, huh? loser
im a sucker for that type of stuff.
and the love thing with the other robot
it was super cute
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new beauty and the beast?
the more human, non cartoon one?
yes, with emma watson
I have.  I thought it was a little scary to be honest for my kids
How old are your kids again, and was it more beast they were afraid of
6 and 4.  and yes, it was beast and how aggressive and mean he was
right, I usually don't see a lot of that in disney films outside of the villians
that's what I was thinking while watching it.  and the cgi was okay, some were not good
oh really, you felt the movie looked not smooth
right, there were scenes with belle and the candlesticks that were not smooth
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think I want to dress up as one of the Disney Princesses for Halloween.
Which one?
I'm not sure, yet.
Well, which one's your favorite?
I can't just go with that! I want to make sure it's one I actually look like.
It doesn't matter, you can make your own version! People are always putting their own spin on things, "steampunk" this and "modern" that.
I guess I could, but I'm really not that good at sewing or costuming or whatever.
I'll help you. We can work on our costumes together and ours will be the best.
You think we could use them to enter the contest? I don't know about getting up on stage.
We'll do it together, trust me. I'll make mine go with yours and we'll go up there as a team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i feel like the lion in that disney movie
what movie?
you know, the one with the red lion and a bronw pig
you mean the lion king?
yes that one
but why do you feel like that movie?
because in one scene the big lion is stomped by hundreds of animals
its because you went to the gym?
yeah
that explains it
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have pictures to show you of my kids Trick or Treating last weekend.
Oh how cute. MaryAnn looks adorable. What's her costume character?
She wanted to be Princess Jasmine from the Disney movie Aladdin.
Her costume is beautiful.
Thanks, I made the costume for her.
Wow, it's nice. Was it hard to make?
No, not at all. The Disney website had costume ideas and directions on what to get to make the costume.
How long did it take to make it?
About 45 minutes. MaryAnn loves it so much she wants to keep it to play dress-up in.
I didn't see Aladdin, but the costume is beautiful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like 'Finding Nemo?'
I thought it was cute, but I liked the sequel way better.
Disney movies are some of the rare exceptions in film, in that sequels are actually good.
You're right.  Take a look at 'Toy Story 3' and how great that was.
Don't forget the 'Pirates' franchise.
That's right!  While the first was the best in my opinion, the second and third movies were worthy additions.
Are there any you can think of that weren't good Disney sequels?
I think 'Cars 2.'
Yea, that was pretty bad.  Though I am curious about what the third movie will be like.
I am too.  I hope the third installation redeems the 'Cars' franchise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
The one with Emma Watson as Belle?
Yes, that one!
Yes, I thought the singing was great!
Me too. I can't believe they made that guy look like the beast the entire movie.
I know! It was wonderfully cast with Emma Thompson, Kevin Cline, and all those famous people.
Yes, I thought so too! Do you know when it will be on DVD?
Oh, it's already out on DVD!
Oh good, I wonder if Target has it?
I heard they were selling out quickly, so you may want to go soon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't get all the hype for Frozen when it came out.
What do you mean?
It was a good movie no doubt, but a bit overrated.
I didn't think so.  Why is that?
The actual story itself wasn't much different from most Disney stories.
But the ending showing family love was.
I guess so, but it wasn't that hard to see from my vantage point.
I guess you just have a bit of a cold heart like Anna, eh?
Hey, that's pretty creative.  Maybe you should make films.
Maybe I should!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that The Lion King is playing in theaters for it's 20th anniversary?
No, but that's sounds really cool! I loved The Lion King.
Me too. When Simba meets Timon and Pumba is probably my most favorite part of the movie.
Yeah. Hakuna Matata!
And then I'll never forget the sad part when Scar says to Mufasa, "Long live the king."
Of course, who could forget that?
It's a masterpiece. I'm going to go see it next week.
Yeah, I think I'll go see it, too.
Do you want to go together?
Yeah, absolutely. Hakuna Matata!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Pirate movie?
No, I've only seen the original.
Oh, you should see it! It was really great.
I really like Johnny Depp.
Me, too! He nails the character.
Is it scary? My daughter doesnI't like scary movies.
It's not that bad, but very sensitive kids might be bothered.
I think we'll wait until it's on video.
That's a good idea. Then you can always turn it off.
I'll do that. I'm glad you liked it, though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Disney movie Up?
I sure did and I'm one of the people who cried within the first five minutes.
They knew they were pulling on our heartstrings with that one.
The story of the old couple and how they grew up together was so heartwarming.
That's true, you could definitely understand his demeanor after seeing that.
I think Disney and Pixar make a great team when they get together.
It's the best alliance in Hollywood in my opinion.
That's for sure. Did you know they're coming out with a new The Incredibles?
It's about time! People have been crying for a sequel for years.
I'm one of them. I hope Samuel L. Jackson's character Frozone comes out in this one again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wall-E was a pretty underrated movie.
In some ways.  I like how there was little dialogue.
The part on Earth was much better than the spaceship.
I disagree.  I kind of liked how man because lazy.
It got a bit too preachy though.  It was better when he was picking up trash.
It was a cautionary tale for man though.
You're reading too much into it.
No I'm not.  Man got lazy, machines did everything for us kind of like how things are going today.
Be lazy and get fat eating food?  I'm in.
You're missing the point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Your top 3 Disney movies of all time, go.
Okay, first I like Mulan.
Yes, I love her story and her character arc.
Agreed, a warrior Princess can't be beat.
After that?
I like Beauty and the Beast, but the animated original.
Yes, the songs are catchy.
And then I like the Little Mermaid.
Yes! Again, the songs are amazing.
Basically, we just love Disney songs in their movies, don't we?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Disney princess?
It's either Merida from Brave or Ariel from the Little Mermaid.
Yes, I agree about The Little Mermaid. That is such a classic movie.
I agree. It's so timeless, kids today still watch it.
Yes, Jodi Benson was the perfect voice as Ariel.
I know, she really made the music in that movie so beautiful.
The rest of the music from that movie is some of my favorite of all time.
I agree. "Kiss the girl" and "Under the Sea" is some of the best composed music ever.
I agree. I feel like the lack of music in Brave really sets it apart from The Little Mermaid.
I agree you with completely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Disney is something else
Why
They make many sequels
True
Its just odd
Why
Because it feels like they make nothing new
But they do
Like what
Moana is new
XXXXXXXXXXX
When was the best era of disney movies?
I would say the very beginning, around the 30's and 40's, was the best.
For example? Which movies.
I think Pinocchio is a classic!
It's so boring though
Nonsense, for the time it came out, the animation is amazing. And the morals are good as well.
But the 90's movies were better.
What 90's movie can be better than Pinocchio?
Beauty and the Beast is so much better.
Well that's your opinion
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about all the new Disney movies based on animated films?
Other than Beauty and the Beast?
That was the most recent, but they announced quite a few new ones coming soon. Think 22 give or take.
Like what?
Off the top of my head... Aladdin which I'm most psyched about, Mulan, Cuella, Peter Pan, The Sword in the Stone, Chip n Dale, Maleficent 2, and Jungle Book 2.
Nice to see Hollywood is still out of fresh ideas.
Hey! Normally I'd agree with you, but even though they're based on their animated counterparts they've done a beautiful job bringing them to life and giving a complete modern reimagining to them.
I guess you're right, and I did thoroughly enjoy The Jungle Book with Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, and Idris Elba. Absolutely lost it when King Louie busted out into one of my favorite Disney songs.
Oh, oobee doo! I wanna be like you!
I wanna walk like you! Talk like you, too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like Disney movies?
Sure, why?
Which one is your favorite?
Probably the Lion King.  What about you?
Definitely Pocohantas.  I loved the music.
Disney always has the best soundtracks.  I loved the soundtrack from Aladdin too.
Yeah, that was great.  A Whole New World is an awesome song.
They always have really talented singers on their cast.
Yeah, they always make great choices in voice actors.   I can't wait for the next Disney movie to come out.
Me too, they never disappoint.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My kids watched Mary Poppins for the first time yesterday, while they were sick.
That is a great movie!
Yes. It really stands the test of time.
I think it was Dick Van Dyke's greatest performance.
Julie Andrews is amazing too.
I always thought Mary Poppins and Bert were boyfriend and girlfriend, but I heard a theory that she was actually Bert's governess.
I've heard that theory too, but it doesn't feel right to me, you know?
Yes, it doesn't feel like that kind of relationship to me either.
Anyway, now my kids are begging me to add sugar to their children's Tylenol.
As kids, I'm pretty sure we begged for that that too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
alice in wonderland is a classic movie, so full of wonder
I always wondered what that little cake tasted like
the one that said "eat me" I know, I wish I could find a magic cake
The queen of hearts wanted to shop everyone's head off
I know, I am glad Alice was able to escape and get back home
The man who wrote this suffered from bad migraines
I heard that, people say this was a dream he had after he took opiates for a headache
that makes sense because of the cat who was shown smoking and changing colors
this movie has such a bog following, I am sure many kids have imagined falling into a rabbit hole
I know, it would be fun to disappear into a different world sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen pinocchio?
of course, its a classic.
so what was the deal when pinocchio went off to school
what do you mean?
its kind of strange, at one point he goes off where a bunch of boys get turned into donkeys
oh yeah, that was crazy
they never really address what happens to the rest of the boys after they are turned into donkey
that is kind of weird.
a lot of the parts of the movie are strange like that. later he goes to bottom of the ocean to get gepetto out of a whale
i never really thought about it
XXXXXXXXXXX
So Disney owns marvel and Star wars whats next
Who knows
Seriously it is so different than i had thought
Wait till they get DC
That is never gonna happen
It might
Nah never
What about star trek
That is even less likely
Nah
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Disney movie fan?
Yes! My favorite Disney movie is Moana.
That's so funny - that's actually my favorite movie too!
Heihei the chicken is my favorite character - I love when he's hiding in the boat.
The scene right before it was scary for me. I didn't like it when it was so stormy.
Me too! I wasn't sure if she was going to make it, but good thing Maui was there.
Maui's tattoos were awesome - I loved how they kept dancing around his body.
Oh! I also loved when they would push him to do something, like be nice to Moana.
The music was also so beautiful and catchy.
I keep singing the song "How Far I'll Go" and it gets stuck in my head!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Disney movie is the Princess and the Frog.
I know mine too.  It was so romantic.
I love the scenery and the storyline.  Princess Tiana is so beautiful.
Oh and Prince Naveen is so handsome.  I love that it was set in New Orleans.
Me too.  The bayou and the food.  Delicious.
Its making me hungry for some jumbalaya and some beignets.
I wish they would make a sequel to that.  Do you think they have children?
I do too.  I would love to see their life together and yes they must have children.
And they lived happily ever after.
Exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I rewatched Snow White the other day.
I haven't seen that since I was a kid.
It's actually pretty funny. Though the animation's a lot worse than I remember it being.
Didn't it first come out in the 40s?
The 30s! 1937!
That seems so long ago.
I was looking at the cast list, and I couldn't even remember the names of any of the actors.
So Humphrey Bogart isn't in it?
No! But that's the right era though!
I was just kidding.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your pick for best Disney character?
I think that Ariel from 'The Little Mermaid' takes the crown.
Out of all the characters, that's who you think is the best?
Yes, she is very likable, and she is in a great Disney movie.
I just think that there are so many choices that are better.
Okay, who do you think is the greatest Disney character?
I like Simba from The Lion King.
That's actually a pretty good pick.
We get to see him learn, grow, and come of age as a leader.
I like your explanation, but I still love Ariel the most.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I have got into Disney movies recently.
For the first time?
No, just once again, the first time since I was a kid.
How are you liking the reviewing?
They are all supposed to have like a moral right?
I think so, yes.
Then what is the moral of Frozen?
Friendship, over coming? Sisterhood maybe.
I do not see it. Elsa was just spoiled and angry, she never really over came anything.
She did learn to, let it go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No, I tried to go but it was already gone by the time I went to our local theater.
I heard it had awful ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.
Yeah, well you can't trust their opinions. Sometimes the reviewers dislike the ones I like the best.
True, plus I always want to see Johnny Depp!
Yes, me too! I heard that he appeared in person at the Pirates' ride at Disneyworld, pretending to be a character statue of Jack Sparrow.
Yes, I saw a video of that, and he began to move as a boat of people moved by.He was promoting this latest movie I think.
Wow, how did the people act when the character figure moved, andthey realized that it was the real Captain Sparrow?
They were excited! They whipped out their videos and cameras!
Well I would have loved to see that! I hope to see the movie soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
hey
What is up
Nothing much
Same
Want to come over
Sure
We can watch come classics
Like
Some Pinocchio
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about the movie Aladdin?
What do I think? That is one of the best animated action movies.
So I´m guessing you really like it, why?
I think Aladdin is an amazing hero, he is humble, handsome, good hearted.
What other characters do you like from the movie?
You can´t live without Abu, the Genie, of course Jasmine.
What do you think about the Genie?
He is very funny! After Aladdin he steals the show.
What is you favorite scene?
When Aladdin and Jasmine go on the magic rug to tour the world, and at the same time the song a Whole New World plays.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Elle Fanning in a preview for an upcoming movie. She's grown up since I saw her in Maleficent.
DIdn't you just love that movie, Maleficent? I sure did.
Yes, I wish they would do another one.
They could have Elle's character, Princess Aurora, all grown up now.
That would be cool, and that bird guy that helps Maleficent could be in it still.
Well sure. They should have all the original characters, including Sleeping Beauty's father.
Did he live at the end? I can't remember.
You mean King Stefan? No he died at the end. But...hmmm...
I know! He could have a twin brother who shows up to claim he owns the kingdom or somthing...
Yes that might work. As long as they keep Angelina Jolie at Maleficent. She's great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which did you think was better, Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid?
Wow, that's a hard call. I liked them both.
The Little Mermaid has those amazing underwater shots, and the music is terrific.
That's true! But if we're talking animation, the ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast is a classic.
True enough. Ariel may be my favorite Disney princess, though.
Why's that? I like Belle's love of reading, and her desire to help her father.
I like Ariel's curiosity, and her willingness to sacrifice everything to see a new world.
And to be with the man she loves - don't forget about that!
How could I? They're both great romances.
They really revived the Disney movie genre.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the movie Wreck-It Ralph?
Yes, I loved it! Vanellope is so cute.
What did you think of King Candy?
I was so shocked! Who would have thought he was Turbo.
They're making a sequel.
Really? When does it come out?
Maybe 2018, I'm not sure.
I'm going to watch it for sure!
I hope it's just as good as the first one.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie Malificent?
Yes I did. Angelina Jolie was pretty convincing as Malificent.
Yes She was. She looked pretty scary.
I wanted to take my grandkids but I though it may be a little scary for them.
Yes could be.
The special effects were really good.
It was a good spinoff on Sleeping Beauty.
Yea, Disney movies can't be beat.
The animation in the animated ones is amazing.
Generally you are never disappointed in a Disney film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I always liked Finding Nemo alot.
Is that the movie with the fish?
Yeah, it's a pretty heartwarming movie.
How was it a heartwarming movie?
I almost cried when the fish got captured.
Honestly, I might have cried as well.
I know it was rough seeing humans with the fish.
They saw them as food and tried to capture them.
That's what made the fishes' journey so difficult.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch Cars or Cars 2?
Of course, who hasn't!
Heard Cars 3 is set to release around mid-July 2017!
Wow! I'm super excited about it, can't wait for it to release.
Same here, my family is looking forward to it.
I'm looking forward to Lightning McQueen's actions on the screen.
McQueen with Doc and Sally are fun to watch.
I wonder what kind of story is lined up in Cars 3.
Well, you don't have to wait long and it sure will be fun and entertaining.
Yes. Jotting down the date in my calendar for advance booking.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When you were younger what was your favorite Disney movie?
I always loved The Little Mermaid.
Why did you like it so much?
I have red hair like Ariel so she was always my favorite.
I think most little girls like Ariel because she is a mermaid.
I agree, I think all little girls want to be mermaids.
I know I did!
Something about mermaids just seems so magical.
I still hope mermaids are real!
Me too! Maybe they are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the new Disney movie Moana?
Excellent, her story is based on a young woman who is the heroine of the movie.
Mohana was released in 2016
Yes! On November 23 in the United States and then in the other countries
It is a super funny movie, the character Maui steals the heart of the goddess Te Fiti, since it was wanted by many
Yes, the sea monsters also coveted the heart, and one of them, called Te Ka.
When Moana grows, she realizes that the island may disappear
Oh yes, her grandmother helps her discover that her ancestors are travelers and she embarks on saving her island.
When she finds Maui she forces him to take the heart of Te Fiti
Sure, and it helps him to retrieve his hook, then place the heart of Te Fiti.

hey i want to get better at cooking but dont want to go back to school
all you got to do is watch the movie ratatouille
im being serious and this is what you propose?
yes because i am being serious also
and how is watching a disney movie going to help?
well in the movie the rat had a strong desire to cook and even though he was looked down upon for being a rat he never gave up
so how does that apply to me?
well you love cooking so find it within yourself to get the motivation to teach yourself to cook so you can become great like ratatouille.
well when you put it like that it sounds promising
of course it does, your welcome now go be the best chef you can be
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happens in the movie Fuzzbucket?
A boy gives a concoction to his imaginary friend and then he comes to life.
Wow, what does he look like?
He is a furry looking and short guy. He has a tail.
What happens to him?
He eventually goes home where all of his people are.
Cool, anything else?
Yeah, the boy's parents do not believe him.
I wouldn't either.
It's a great movie though. Not many people know about it. But, it is Disney.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Disney's The Good Dinosaur!
How did you like it?
I enjoyed it a lot. A bit of a tearjerker though.
Some of the Disney movies are.
Yeah this young dinosaur's dad died early on, like Bambi's mother did.
That was definitely sad.
Then it gets terribly lost, and goes on a long journey.
How does it go?
It meets a lost human boy, they both have adventures, and it finds a family for the boy.
Sounds like a typical sweet Disney tale.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Mulan?
Yes I have, why?
Okay my question is, do you consider her a princess.
I've always categorized her as one.
Some people don't think she is and in technicality she isn't.
That's so strange, because she's know as one.
She's not of royal blood. She only becomes a soldier.
Well she becomes a warrior.
This is why I always ask because I love to hear people's opinions.
She becomes a warrior princess. She saves her country. She's definitely a princess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched Disney's Mary Poppins last night.  Ever see it?
Yeah but way back in the day!
Sounds like you liked it too?
Definitely, especially the music. "A Spoonful of Sugar" is my favorite.
Yeah, cute.  I like "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."
That's a mouthful.  I guess the cartoon animation was new at the time.
I don't remember other movies with that.
I wanted to be Mary Poppins for a while.
Ha ha! I see what you mean though.
She was practically perfect.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite scene in The Little Mermaid?
My favorite scene is probably in the royal kitchen with the singing chef.
Ah les poissons. I always found that song hilarious
It has the same tune as "Be Our Guest" from Beauty and the Beast.
What really??
Yes! It makes me laugh every time I think about it.
My favorite scene is probably around the very end where Triton lets Ariel become a human and stay with Eric.
Oooh, yes the glittering water is beautiful.
Just that whole scene is so pretty and just what you want.
A happy ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch movies on the disney channel?
Yes i enjoy them
Do you remembee that one with hilary duff?
Which one i think there were a couple
Cadet kelly
Yes that one was good
Hilary duff is a great actress
And you never see her in the news either
Thats a good thing
Yea, i always let my kids watch her
XXXXXXXXXXX
Disney recently acquired Star Wars. Do you think Star Wars movies are now Disney movies?
It's hard to say. I would have to say yes.
I disagree. I think Disney has its own thing and adding Star Wars just doesn't make sense.
I can see where you are coming from. But Disney has really made these movies into their own.
I'll be honest, I haven't actually seen any of the Disney made Star Wars films.
Are you serious? You have to see them - they are so rich in storyline.
Do they feel like the old Star Wars movies?
Yes, in many ways they do. With a Disney touch.
I feel like it cheapens both franchises.
Ok, you have convinced me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My son is very into Beauty and the beast.
How old is your son?
He is 3!
Mine was 4 when he started watching disney movies.
How old is your child now and what is his favorite?
He is 5 and he loved the little mermaid.
There was actually a scary part in that movie.
Which one?
When Ursala take's her voice and those green hands come out, its pretty creepy.
OH YAH i tottally remember now, he used to look away at that part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Finding Nemo was a great Disney movie, don’t you think?
Yes, all of the tropical fish were so vibrant, and colourful.
It didn’t have a lot of singing in it like many Disney movies.
I still enjoyed it though; I thought the characters were charming.
Which was your favourite character?
I liked Dory best, the forgetful fish.
I agree, I liked Dory best as well, she was very funny.
I though the part with the sharks was a bit scary.
Yes, but I felt sorry for them as well, because they were trying so hard to be vegetarians.
I thought Bruce the shark was very funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Captain Jack Sparrow is the best pirate character ever.
I loved Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest!
The scene where he is talking to the guards, right before Elizabeth falls from the cliffs is the most hilarious. He's telling them the truth, and they don't believe him.
The look on their faces when he removes Elizabeth's corset is priceless.
I liked when he used his handcuffs as a zipline.
That was funny, so was when he and Will hijacked the ship.
I liked the part where they were walking underwater with the canoe.
I still don't understand how they could breathe!
That Will Turner is so dreamy. Who didn't think that when they watched it?
I know I sure did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There is a new Pirates of the Caribbean Movie coming out.
Again?  There have been so many.
Ya, it seems like that.
The last couple weren't all that great.
Well the reviews on this one are a lot better.
Okay well that's a relief.
You can't go wrong with Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow.
No, you are right about that.
And Javier Bardem is in this one as Armando Salazar
Oh he will be scary for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney film?
I would probably have to say Beauty and the Beast.
That's a good one, but do you mean the live action or the animated one?
Animated.  The live action one was a fine remake and Emma Watson was a great choice for Belle, but I didn't love her singing.
I agree with you.  Disney is really pumping out a lot of live action movies lately.  The CGI was cool in The Jungle Book, I can't wait to see what they do with The Lion King.
I can't image there being a live action version of the Lion King, there aren't even any people in it.
Good point,  Hey, did you hear they're making a new Frozen movie?
No I did not!  I can't imagine what direction they'd be able to take that movie in.
Me either, but I have high hopes for it.
I hope the songs are just as good as the first one.  Let it Go was in my head for at least a year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Aladdin?
Yes. I like the Genie.
Robin Williams was great at that part! That was the first movie I saw in theatres.
I think mine was The Lion King.
The Lion King is my favorite of the Disney classics.
I don't really have a favorite of the classics. But my favorite one overall is Toy Story.
I really liked Toy Story too. I was really impressed that the sequels were just as good as the original.
Yeah, that doesn't usually happen with sequels. Just look at Little Mermaid and Lion King.
I know! I didn't even see those sequels.
They weren't that great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Computer that Wore Tennis Shoes?
I don't think so.
It was a Disney classic!
What was it about?
This kid gets zapped by a computer and becomes a genius.
Who's in it?
Kurt Russel.
That guy's pretty good.
He used to do a lot of Disney.
Huh, never knew.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yesterday I had the opportunity to see Finding Dory.
I saw it months ago. It was very funny. Did  you like it?
A lot! I want to see it again.
By the way, last week Ellen Degeneres in her show was talking about how wonderful was to work in this movie.
She wanted this movie since years ago. She did a nice job.
I think all the cast did a good job. The movie earned thousand of millions in a few weeks.
It's well deserved. It was not the same with The BFG movie. I saw it yesterday too.
The BFG was not the best movie from Steven Spielberg but I did like it.
It was good, but I prefer Finding Dory.
I prefer that too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney films do you like?
Honestly, I have enjoyed almost all I have ever seen. I love Aladdin.
Same here. Robin Williams was phenomenal as the Genie. And Scott Weigner as Aladdin!
Robin Williams was fantastic. And yes, Scott Weigner was great, too.
Abu was my favorite character. Such a cute monkey!
I liked him too. I thought the magic carpet was sweet, too, even though it didn't talk.
What'd you think of the ending?
I loved it. It was scary when Jafar put Jasmine into the hourglass and she started drowning in sand.
How about when he turned into a snake?
Even scarier! He was a scary villain.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I would have to say Sleeping Beauty.
Why is this?
I think is very romantic that a Prince wakes you up with a kiss.
What else did you life about the movie?
That Aurora the main character had 3 fairy good mothers.
Is that so, why is this?
They were there to protect her from Maleficent, which was an evil queen.
Why is it called Sleeping Beauty?
Because Maleficent put Aurora under a sleeping spell and she was very pretty.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Pirates of The Caribbean movie that just came out?
The one called Dead Man Tell No Tales?
Yeah that's the one. Have you seen it?
I have actually and it was really good. Will Turner comes back and Jack Sparrow is around of course.
Yeah and I saw the character Barbosa is in it as well.
Yeah. I really like that character. He is hilarious.
Geoffrey Rush was a great choice to play him.
I liked that Will Turner is back.
Yeah although are you bummed Kiera Knightly isn't playing her character?
A little but it is still a good movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Disney's Sleeping Beauty?
Isn't that an old movie?
It is, but it's still fantastic.
What do you like about it?
Well, for one it's funny. There are lots of funny lines that kids wouldn't get.
I always like that. What else do you like?
The costumes are great. Despite being an old cartoon,  there's a quality to them that makes you want to touch them.
Can I get Sleeping Beauty to watch for myself?
It's available on Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital.
I want to get it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Disney version of Pocahontas?
Yeah. It was some great animation. Maybe not my favourite Disney movie though.
Oh, didn't you like it?
It was good, but the subject matter was a little heavy.
Oh, what, the whole native american subjugation thing?
Yeah, that's some deep stuff for a kid's movie.
No doubt. I think it had some historical inaccuracies too.
Well of course, they needed to take some liberties. They made John Smith seem much more heroic.
Not surprising. Authentic history doesn't make for a great narrative.
Precisely. It was still a well done film though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favourite Disney movie?
I have always loved Toy Story, I've seen it a hundred times.
Have you seen Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 as well?
Yes, although I think that the first one was the best.
I agree. I especially liked Woody, I think he's very funny.
Yes, Tom Hanks did a great job there.
When did the first Toy Story come out anyway?
I think it was in 1995.
And the last one came out just a while ago, right?
Yes, it came out in 2010.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Remeber the Titans for the first time last night.
You hadn't seen it?
No.
You been living under a rock?!
Just missed it. The wife said I should watch it.
Denzel was so good in it.
He's always good.
I also liked that bigger fellow.
The one from My Name is Earl.
Yeah, he was pretty good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Oh, is that the live action remake?
Yeah, the one that stars Emma Watson.
I haven't had time to go see it yet. Was it any good?
Yeah I really liked it a lot.  It changed a few things from the original.
Was it weird to see it in live action?
No, it didn't take away at all. They can do such good things with CGI these days.
That's true, so the Chip and Mrs. Potts were still in it?
Yeah all of the animated furniture was still there, and still really funny.
Well, maybe I'll have to see it.  I think maybe it's already out on DVD now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite Disney movie?
Animated or Live-action?
Oh, I meant animated only.
Well , that has to be The Lion King.
Why do you like it so much?
It was one of the first animated movies I ever watched and the story is pretty good too.
Did you know it is loosely based on one of Shakespeare's works?
What? No! Which one is it based on?
It's hamlet! The uncle Kills the father of the protagonist and exiles him when he is little kid, after growing up he comes back , takes revenge and rule over the kingdom.
Wow! you are right! It never occurred to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what your favorite toy story movie?
I grew up with the first two
my favorite is the third one
yeah, it is just as good.
the third one is more emotional to me.
they are all just as good though.
they did good.
not many companies do well with the third sequel
they were able to do it right
and be even more emotive with it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get around to watching The Emperors New Groove?
Yes it was so funny I loved it!
I know! Who was your favorite character?
Oh Kronk he was so rediculous.
Yea I loved when he was cooking in the restaurant.
Oh that was great. Who was your favorite character?
Well outside of Kronk I think it was Yzma.
Oh really, why is that?
She reminds me of my mom. I know that sounds bad, they just sound alike.
Oh I kinda thought the same thing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite Disney animated film.
I would have to say Alice in Wonderland.
Why? What is it about?
Oh it´s about a magical place a little girl visits, but it ends up being a dream.
What is the place like?
Everything is upside down, animals can talk, flowers can sing, you can grow and shrink.
Oh wow! It does sound magical. Which is your favorite character from the movie?
The Mad Hatter, he is hilarious.
Which is your favorite scene of the movie?
When Alice is having tea with the Mad Hatter.

But i loved them as i loved the movies
Most seemed to not it seems
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the movie Tangled?
I loved it, it was so cute!
Me too, I thought it was an interesting remake of Rapunzel.
It did a good job of breathing new life into old stories, especially with the addition of certain new characters.
Like Maximus and Pascal?
Yes! Oh my goodness, I loved Pascal!
Even though he was just a chameleon, he seemed like such an important character in the story!
He was so funny, such a good sidekick!
What about Maximus? Watching his grudge with Flynn was hilarious!
That, and the fact that he can be bribed with apples.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear people are complaining about the new Beauty and the Beast?
Ugh. The outrage never stops.
Yeah, it's getting ridiculous.
So what are they complaining about?
Well, the new Beauty and the Beast has a gay character.
That doesn't seem objectionable to me.
Nor to me.
People can be the worst sometimes.
Yeah, and the ridiculous part about it is that Beauty and the Beast is about a woman falling in love with an anthropomorphic animal.
Yeah, there was no objection to that as far as I've seen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your wedding song going to be?
"You got a friend in me" from Toy Story.
I love that! Toy Story was my favorite movie growing up.
Yea mine too. It was actually the first movie me and him watched together. He even let me write Andy on the bottom of his foot.
That's adorable. Which one of you is more like buzz and which one is more like woody?
Oh he's definitely more Buzz that I am.
Yea I could totally see that. I typically date guys who are like Sid.
Haha you make a good point there.
I used to always try to get my parents to take me to Pizza Planet even though they don't exist.
Haha me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you know which one was the first ever Walt Disney movie ?
Absolutely ! I think it was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I think it was produced in 1930's
Oh really ! It's so amazing that I still like this movie whenever I see it.
Same here. Though it was a classic Black & White movie, but I never miss colors watching this movie.
Who's character you liked the most in this movie ?
Without question, the main character. The "Snow White" !
And I would presume, you hated her step mother's character ? The wicked Queen.
Well, same here. I am forgetting her name in the movie. Grimhilde was she ? Oh yes, her name was Grimhilde .
Yup. She was called Grimhilde. Do you know that the story of the movie was compiled years before the movie was released.
Yes, I know. It was done in 1934. In those days, making a movie used to take years, due to technical limitations !
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just got finished watching Moana with my daughter for the 100th time!
Wow, that's a lot! She must love that movie!
She really does. Especially the songs, when they come on she sings and dances. It's adorable!
Aww! I've heard a bit about the movie, but I've never seen it. It's the one with The Rock in it right?
Yes, he plays a demi-god named Maui. He's actually pretty funny!
I've been meaning to watch it. What's it about?
Moana is the main character, she travels across the sea with Maui to save her island from "the darkness".
Where does it take place?
I thought it was Hawaii because of Maui, but I read somewhere it's actually inspired by the Polynesian islands like Bora Bora and Samoa.
Sounds awesome. I'll have to check it out soon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you see the Cars 2?
Yes, it was awesome and it has very good graphics quality as well.
Yes, it nice and new stunts that created by the graphics it was cool.
you see the drifting stunt that was awesome.
Yes, I saw that and as compared to the previous one this was OK not that much I liked it, what about you?

Do you like Mufasa?
Yes, James Earl Jones did a great job with his voice.
I miss those cartoons. It is all Pixar now.

I think the most recent cartoon was The Princes and the Frog.
Yeah, that was a really good one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Cinderella?
Yes, my sister used to watch it all the time when we were young.
Were you a fan?
It was okay, the step mother was scary.
Yes, and the sisters were pretty scary looking
Right, treated Cinderella very badly
At least she found her fairy god mother in the end.
That she did
And her glass slipper
Yes, the infamous glass slipper.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't like the movie Snow White.
I don't either.
The only thing cute about that is the dwarfs.
I agree.
Snow White is an annoying character.
She is. I like the evil stepmother better.
Me too. My favorite dwarf is Bashful.
I liked Grumpy.
Yes, he is a good one.
Doc is not bad either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just found out that I can watch Disney movies on Netflix.
Really? Do they have any new ones or just the older releases?
I saw some that have recently been in theaters.
Oh, that's very helpful. I don't always get to see movies in the theater that I want to see.
I know what you mean. I get busy too.
Yes, and now I can see the movies that I want to see when I have time and without leaving my house.
Would you like to come over on Friday and watch some of the newer releases?
That would be great! Can I bring anything?
No. I will have appetizers and drinks.
Ok. I'll bring some popcorn.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How good was the movie The Lion King, released in 1994!
Yes, it has one of the best Disney animations
Great film, the plot is developed in Africa.
It is true, we can observe the different species of animals that appear in the film
His story is sad, it is that the king of the pack Mufasa betrays his brother and dies!
Of course, leaving orphan to Simba, who had to flee from the herd by his uncle stealing his throne.
Then Simba meets Pumbaa and Timon
They are very funny characters
They sing the song Hakuna Matata
Oh sure, that's my favorite song in the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the creepiest Disney villain?
I'd say it was the Witch Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
"Mirror mirror on the wall... who's the creepiest of them all?"
YOU are! You are!
Hehe, she was definitely freaky.
And made a point of actually poisoning Snow White. That was nasty.
Very true. But she was saved by a handsome price, right?
Yeah, in the end. I would have made more sense if the dwarves saved her.
What were their names? Sleepy and Sneezy and Doc? I can't recall the rest.
Something like that. Weird they didn't play a bigger part in saving her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you believe the CGI in Disney's new The Jungle Book?
It was beautiful! Loved all the animals.
Talking, wild animals.  Nice story too.
I couldn't believe Bill Murray did a voiceover.
Baloo, what a lazy bear.
Shere Khan scared me.
He was pretty fierce, no doubt.
Kaa was a baddie too. Scarlett Johansen I think.
They had a lot of good voice talent.
Its a quality movie.I want to see it on hi-def.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Mulan.
Mulan from the Disney movie?
Yea, she's pretty much a superhero plus she's my favorite princess.

Oh right! The one voiced by Eddie Murphy. What was his name again?
Mushu.
Right! He was awesome.
Yea he was hilarious. Easily my favorite sidekick of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new beauty and beast movie?
No not yet. Is it like the original?
In some ways. The original is better in my opinion.
I figured it would not be as good as the first, sequels never are as good as originals.
The story line is close to the same though.
That's good. I will have to just watch it and compare.
It was worth the watch.
Cool.  Are all the characters the same?
Yes. There's bell, the beast, gustan, the candle stick, and the others.
Good. I don't like when characters are changed.  Thanks

I really liked it.
Did you find something that you didn't like at all.
To be honest, it was pretty good.  I really enjoyed the picture of it.
Well, I thought it was kind of boring at the beginning but it turned out out to be good.  Especially the music.
That's true, the songs were very pretty and the characters's voice were amazing.  I really like that guy as the male actor.
I do want to see it again, I may watch it tonight.
Oh yes, it is already in Netflix.
Why don't you come to my place tonight, I'll order some pizza.
That's a great idea, we can watch it together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There is talk of a new Mulan coming out sometime in 2018.
I loved Mulan when I was growing up. Is it going to be a Mulan 2?
Actaully I heard it was suppose to be a live action film.
So it won't be a cartoon at all. Will it still be a musical?
They said at first it wasn't going to be, but I read later that they changed their minds.
I loved the songs from the first one so hopefully they can capture the same feel.
I wonder if they will bring Mushu back and if so how will they create him in the live action version.
I don't know, but he was such a funny character I hope they bring him back also.
Well when it comes out, I will definatly call you.
We will have to go see this in theater, it's always better there.
XXXXXXXXXXX

That is funny. I have a favorite.
What is it?
It is Tangled, the one about Rapunzel.
Really? I like that one too but it isn't my favorite.
Well it has so many great attributes. It is funny, the music is great and so is the singing.
Yes I did love the music in that film.
It was romantic too. I loved the lantern scene where they all float up.
There was a great song during that scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the new Beauty and the Beast live action film.
Yeah I saw it in the theatre was good.
Yeah, Emma Watson did a great job as Belle.
Yes definitely it is one of the reasons I wanted to see the movie.
Yes she is definitely a great actress and very beautiful as well.
Yes the beauty in the title really suits her.
They did a great job with transitioning it from the animated movie to real life.
Yes the beast was well done and CGI really helped to bring some of the other supporting cast to life.
Yes the music was timeless as well with a new spin on it.
Yes Emma Watson can can sing and act. She is the total package.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Pinochio is really a porn movie?
No it isn't. Someone made a porn version of Pinochio but Disney would never do that.
Well did you hear that Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer had an affair Bambi's mother?
No I didn't. Is that the real reason she died in the movie? (laughing)
No, she died running away from her husband who was not Bambi's father.
Are you telling me Rudolph The Reindeer Is Really Bambi's father?
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Bambi's two cousins looked at other suspiciously until one broke the silence...

I was so surprised The Rock could sing that well!
Me too. Maui was my favorite character.
Mine was Heihei the chicken!
Such a goofy character!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally saw the new version of Beauty and the Beast.
Did you like it?
I don't really think so, I have such a fond memory of the original one.
Yeah, that one rocks.  Did you like anything better in the new one?
Well, they certainly developed characters more: Gaston and Lefou were better.  Gaston was almost sympathetic!
Yeah, I agree.  And you have to love the real scenes and fantastic CGI.
That was breathtaking, you're right.  And it was nice seeing some big stars.
Who knew Emma Watson could sing?
And so well.  I don't think every Disney classic has to go live action, but this one was ok.
You just grew up with the animated one, a new generation will grow up on this one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Disney movie princess?
I like Cinderella the best.
What about her do you like?
Well, that's the very first princess movie that I saw.
So she's like a classic princess for you?
I like how she fought against the evil stepsisters.
Yeah, it was easy to not like them at all.
They were so spoiled rotten and mean to Cinderella.
Did you want to dress up like her when you were a kid?
Yeah, I even got shoes that looked like her glass slippers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of movies do you like?
I really enjoy disney movies
Me too
They are great to watch
I recently saw Brave
Did you like it
I really liked it
Me too
You saw it?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they should do another Alladin?
No i think that was a classic
I agree thats why they should do a 2nd one.
They would have already done that
True but you can always go back to the well.
The genie voice would not be the same.
Thats true, maybe they could get someone who sounds like him.
I bet most of his script was ad-libbed.
I agree you are probably right.
He was such a great voice actor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie the three caballeros?
I have! It´s kinda old, but I think is a classic one.
Who are the main characters from the movie?
Donald Duck, Panchito Pistoles, and Jose Carioca.
What nationalities are they.
American, Mexican and Brazilian.
What is the film about?
They visit different parts in Latin America.
What do you think the message of the movie is about?
To come together different nationalities and learn about each other.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what surpises me about Frozen?
Frozen the cartoon?
Yeah, the Disney movie.
What about it?
Well, it's been so popular for years.  And off of one cartoon.
Okay.  What's your point?
Well, they could have easily turned it into an animated series.
I guess they could have, but why?
What do you mean, why?
It's already super popular.  It's not like they need to extend its popularity.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, what was you're favorite Disney movie growing up?
Alright slow down, are we talking Disney Channel Original Movies or you know, the classics like Cinderella.
Ha, well let's say any Disney movie.
Wow this is a lot. For some reason 101 Dalmations is really standing out the me.
Oh for sure, that's a classic! But I'll admit I preferred the live action one to the animated flick.
That's how it seems to go these days. Well what was your favorite?
That's easy -- A Goofy Movie.
I completely forgot about A Goofy Movie! Remember when that guy had this break with reality or something.
Yes I remember it well! "Why are we always wearing these gloves all the time?"
Haha that shattered my world watching that as a little kid. I was like, why DO they where gloves all the time?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember the first Toy Story movie; I think we watched it ten times.
Me, too!  My favorite character is Mr. Potato Head, he's so funny.
Poor Woody starts out as the toy in charge, the most important.
Yeah, until Buzz Lightyear comes along.
I used to pretend that my toys would do things, in a way, like they were real, but I never imagined what these toys did.
I kind of look at toys in a different light now, like, is this toy going to come to life as soon as I shut the door and leave?
I know what you mean.  It used to give me nightmares, wondering if a spider with a baby head was going to come crawling up my leg!
Ewww!  That gives me the creeps!
The whole perseverance thing with Woody and Buzz, though, is what I remember best from it.
I like it that they were friends at the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
WHat is your favorite disney movie?
That is a hard one!  Little mermaid
Why do you like the little mermaid?
I love the ocean and all the sea animals.  Its real world magical beauty
Who is your favorite character of any disney movie?
I like Elsa.
Why?
She doesn't fall over herself for a man
What was the first disney movie you ever watched?
Snow white
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know they are making a Toy Story 4?
Really? I thought they were finished with just only three movies for a trilogy.
Yeah it comes out in 2019.
Wow. I can't believe they are.
I am a little excited to see it cause they are gonna try to find Bo Peep.
That is kind of cool but I just don't know if I want to see it.
How come?
Well I feel like the series ended on a good note and there is nothing more needing to be said.
Well yeah it is cool Andy gave them a good home and all but that doesn't mean their adventures have to end.
True I suppose you are right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your favorite Disney movie?
That is a hard question, probably The Lion King!
That is a good one, why do you like it?
I love the story, but also the music is great.
Yes it is, I like Can You Feel The Love Tonight, which is your favorite song?
My favorite is probably I Just Can't Wait To Be King, but that is a hard question.
My favorite Disney movie is probably Beauty and the Beast.
Cool, the cartoon or the new live action one?
The cartoon, such as classic. The music is just so wonderful.
I agree, the new one was good, but never as good as the original.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Disney movie "The Good Dinosaur?" It came out last year and I just watched it again last night.
I love that movie, Arlo is the coolest dinosaur. I cried like a baby when I first watched it.
Spot and Arlo are both so similar. They have similar problems with not fitting in in their lives.
I agree, I think that they teach each other about life and help each other through their struggles.
The movie wasn't very popular, it's not very talked about, but I think its one of the best new Disney movies out there.
I think so too, it i an emotional roller coaster with comedy, action, and drama.
I love showing my kids this movie because it makes them understand that even though you may be a little slow or a little different you can still succeed.
Yeah, especially if you have a friend to help you out through the tough times.
I wish I had someone like Arlo when I was younger, I always felt like the outcast.
Me too, "The Good Dinosaur" is such a heartwarming film and it never fails to make me feel happy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard that Anastasia is on Broadway?
Really?
Yeah, I want to go see it.
I bet it's fantastic.
Yeah I loved that movie as a kid!
Me too, I wanted to be the lost princess so bad!
Me too!
I didn't understand anything about the Russians when I was a kid though, that part made no sense.
I know, me too. I couldn't understand why the Czar hated her family!
Yeah, but it didn't even matter, all that mattered to me was the love story!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I saw Maleficent when it came out.
Oh, why?
My wife wanted to see it.
I see, what did you think.
It was horrible, and my wife agreed.
Yes, that's what I heard. Is it the worst Disney movie of all time?
It's a candidate for sure.
What are some other horrible Disney movies?
How about Mars Needs Moms?
Good one. Or how about Frankenweenie? now there's a classic...lol
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Beauty and the Beast movie do you prefer?  The cartoon from 1991, or the new live action film that came out this year?
Well, I haven't seen the new movie, so I guess, the cartoon?
Oh, man.  You have to see the new movie.  Belle is played by one of my favorite actresses, Emma Watson.
You're right.  I do have to see it then, but I don't know if I like how they used the CGI to make the Beast appear.
What don't you like about it?
Well, He looks much smaller than in the animated movie. The old Beast had broad shoulders and looked ferocious.  This one is much slimmer.
You get used to it I suppose.
Who plays Gaston in the 2017 movie?
Some actor named, Luke Evans.  He is pretty good in the film.
I may watch it just for the scene where Gaston storms Beasts' castle with the townspeople; to see if the newer technology adds something to that scene I remember as a child.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When I was a kid, I loved going to Magic Kingdom. My favorite park has to be Hollywood Studios, though.
Can't beat Epcot, that place has everything!
Yeah, it does, but I still like the whole "retro" thing, best. Didn't the Norway ride get replaced?
They practically turned the whole place into Arendelle for Frozen.
I sometimes hear little kids still singing "Let It Go" when I'm walking through the mall.
You've been to Animal Kindgom, right?
Once, but it was sweltering! I hate it when it gets that hot!
They're putting in a new Avatar thing in Animal Kingdom.
Seriously? It feels like only a short time ago they put in that new restaurant at Magic Kingdom.
That one? Yeah, you have to wait for years to eat there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you dressing up as this Halloween?
My favorite character in the world--Mary Poppins.
I love her. The movie with Julie Andrews is one of my favorites.
Isn't it great? I love the friendship between Bert and Mary.
They always had such jolly hollidays together!
Good one! I often sing "I Love to Laugh."
All the different types of laughs are so fun!
One sounds just like my Uncle Jamal.
That's hilarious, because one sounds like my Tia Angela!
How funny!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like The Incredibles?
I didn't like it that much when I first saw it, but it's really grown on me over time.
I felt the same, actually. It didn't seem like something I would enjoy at first.
Edna Mode was the character that got me interested in it, though.
She was so funny! Especially when it came to her opinion on capes!
I hope she is in the sequel.
I would love to see more of her, too. I haven't heard much about the sequel, have you?
No, I just know they announced they will have one.
I hope it is even better than the original movie. Maybe with some more humor.
I would like to see more scenes like when all of the family fights the villain together in the end of the first one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Disney movie
I love the Aristocats
I heard that it 's a boring movie though
No, I love animals and I love cats so the story is very fun
what's it even about
a group of rich cats get kidnapped by a butler and try to find their way back home
what year was it released?
In 1970. It was Walt Disney's last film that he worked on
Wow, it has a special meaning to the Disney company then
Yeah, I really recommend it
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the toy story movie. Did you see it
Yes I did . It was great
I like the part where Buzz light year  says in finity and beyond
I know that was a very good saying
I especially like the part with miss potato head
Her and Mr potato head were so funny
To think that they came up with an idea of your toys coming to life
Makes you think right
I wonder if my toys do that
Well overall that movie was so creative and fun
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the original Beauty and the Beast or the live-action version better?
I haven't seen the live-action version, so I like the original best.
I like both of them a lot, but I agree, the original is my favorite.
I love all of the characters in it, especially Lumiere and Cogsworth.
I think that Gaston and LeFou are pretty funny, too, even if Gaston is a little scary.
Belle definitely didn't belong with someone as bad as Gaston, even if he was entertaining!
Gaston never would have fought off wolves for her like Beast did.
I was so worried that Beast would get killed when he was fighting the wolves!
I was even more worried when he fought Gaston at the end.
I am so glad Beast was okay, he ended up being a good guy after all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw the new Beauty in The Beast movie last night.
Oh ya, and how was it?
It was amazing you should really see it.
I'm not sure, is there a lot of singing in it?
Yes but it is all very good.  And Emma Watson is beautiful in it.
Oh she is beautiful.
And it has gotten great reviews.
71% on rotten tomatoes!
And it is Disney.  They rarely make a bad movie.
You are right about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana yet?
I did! I really liked it, what did you think?
I thought it was really good. I like that Disney is moving away from dainty princesses a little bit.
I completely agree, I feel like the change really started when Brave came out.
Yes, between Brave, Frozen, and Moana. I like the direction Disney is going.
Don't forget the older movies! Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, and Pocahontas.
True. That's a good point.
Disney has really made an effort to make women appear strong over the past few decade,.
I think so too.
There's still work to be done, but its a good start.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like aladdin
Yes i love that movie
Its so good
My favorite character is the genie
I love jasmine
Shes so pretty
They remake everything they should remake aladdin
Exactly
It would be so good
It would
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know Disney is known for its happy themes, but there are surprisingly disturbing moments.
You're right.  Which one is most disturbing for you?
I remember there was the Stegosaurus that was killed explicitly by a T-Rex in 'Fantasia.'
I know that scene.  That one was really disturbing to me too when I first saw it.
Do you have a particular one that comes to mind?
For me, it was when Scar kills Mufasa.
The fact that Mufasa was trampled by a herd was too graphic for me as a child.
It still makes me really sad to this day.
As sad as many of these scenes are, I think they add depth to these movies.
True, they are stronger movies for them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you here about the new movie cruella
yeah it is coming out december 22nd 2017
dont you think everybody has forgot about 101 dalmation
no i loved that movie and cruella is the one that made the movie good
she was very good with her part and played it very good
i think they will make a lot of money of this movie
i do to and i will be the one in the first row watching it
i will be the one singing the songs i still remeber the song cruella devile
im hoping they bring pongo and pretty and the puppys back
me to i cant wait to see it
XXXXXXXXXXX
They need to remaster One Hundred and One Dalmatians.
No they don't. It's a classic.
I know, but the animation is so dated.
Didn't it release in the '60s? There are older more dated Disney films than that.
You mean like Alice in Wonderland?
Sure, Alice in Wonderland. Also Bambi, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Cinderella, and Pinocchio.
You're right. They should remake them all.
Why would you want to remake all those classics?
I don't really enjoy the dated animations. I just want them to look more modern.
To each their own, I guess. But you're wrong.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Kida may be my favorite disney princess...
Kida?
Yeah, from Atlantis.
Oh! I almost forgot about that one.
Seriously, I demand that you go see it again.
Maybe tonight- no, definitely tonight.
Yeah, man because I think the animators used 2D and 3D to make it, just like Treasure Planet.
Really, I love when they do that.
It makes the movie even better when an animator spends so much time paying attention to detail.
It does...it does.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
Dumbo! It makes me cry every time i see it.
What is the name of the song when Moana sings to Te Fiti?
Its called, Know Who You Are.
So is the Lion King sequel any good?
Its okay. It's about Simba's daughter Kiara.
The fight between Merlin and Madam Mim in The Sword in the Stone was awesome.
Yeah it was. I love the part when Merlin turns into a mouse.
Is Pongo like the best Disney dog?
You haven't seen Old Yeller my friend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like the Disney movie Tangled?
Are you kidding? It's my favorite movie! I love Rapunzel!
I do too! I love Flynn Ryder too. His story is so great. I'm glad he ends up happy and not a thief anymore.
Yeah. I think Rapunzel and Flynn go together well. He really helps her learn about who she is.
It's sweet how he takes her to see the floating lanterns, isn't it?
Yes. That's my favorite part. It's so romantic and the song they sing is such a great song.
I think the song in the Ugly Duckling with all the scary guys is my favorite. The one called I've Got A Dream.
Haha, yeah. It's funny to hear about all the characters dreams. They really put a lot of thought into that song.
I bet it was a fun movie to make. The animation was really great, too.
Yeah I love everything about the movie. The songs are so catchy and the story is so heart-warming.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Disney movies?
Well, that's kind of a broad question. There's different kinds of Disney movies?
What do you mean?
You know, there's animated films, live action films,  movies on the Disney Channel, all sorts of different kinds.
Yeah, I guess that's true. I mean, do you like them in general? All of them?
Sure. What's not to like? I love the classics like Snow White and Peter Pan.
Me, too. I love 101 Dalmatians. The originals. And the remakes, too.
And Lady and the Tramp. A great one.
I also like the old live action ones. The cheesy ones, even. Like Escape from Witch Mountain.
That
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw the Disney movie"The Lion King", last night on TV it was good.
That movie is very old.
A new remake is coming out this year.
Disney just came out with "Beauty and the Beast" remake.
The kids like the Disney movies,
There is a movie called "The Good Dinosaur" that my little cousin likes  to watch.
Yeah, the kids love that movie,it is about the little dinosaur trying to do the right thing in his town.
There is another Disney movie called "The Boss Baby" that the kids like to watch too.
I saw that on DVD, it was a good movie.
I know everyone has seen the movie "Lion King", that was one of my favorite Disney movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about The Lion King 2.
Ehhh, it was ok, what did you think.
I thought it was ok too, it didn't come close to capturing the magic of the first one.
I agree, do any of the Disney sequels ever though?
I thought Toy Story did really well.
yea, I guess there is that one, but even those sequels didn't capture the same magic.
Well nothing ever will, you will always like the first one you saw the most.
Now we have to consider Star Wars as well since Disney bought them.
Yea, but you can't consider the ones made before they took over.
Yea, those were way better hahaha!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard there is a live-action remake on cards of 101 Dalmatians.
I absolutely loved the movie and the dogs were a delight to watch.
Well, brace yourself, as the story focuses on Cruella.
Well, I'm not much interested in that villainous character.
Then another piece of news for you, Emma Stone plays Cruella.
What kind of story will the movie have then?
I guess it will focus on the back story of Curella and how she became what she is now.
Do you really think people want to know that?
I guess not. I would love more of those Dalmatians on my screen.
I wouldn't even mind any other breed of dogs or puppies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What disney movie do you like?
New or old?
It doesnt matter
I really enjoyed tangled
Did you know that mandy moore voiced rapunzel
Yes
Shendoes have an obvious voice
Shes really does
And shes a great actress
Love her
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is that disney movie with the Hawaiian Princess?
Moana
Yes, that is the one did you see that crazy lava monster in the movie?
Yes she turns good at the end.
Is there any other good disney movies out right now?
Cars 3 just came out.
Oh that is a movie i want to see I've always liked the cars movies
I am not so much into them but they are pretty popular
Any other good disney movies out there right now?
Beauty and the Beast just came out
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Beauty and the Beast this weekend. I know I'm late to the party, but better late than never.
We tried to go opening weekend but it was sold out everywhere. we saw it 2 weeks after opening day.
Yes it was sold out. Tell me, what did you thing about it? I love it!
I wasn't too keen on the idea of it being a musical, but It was so engaging that the last thing i was thinking was the signing.
I know what you mean and I agree with you. It's more than just a musical, its a movie for the whole family.
It's one of the best movies I've seen in a while.
I agree. The special effects, the costume, the performances were superb.
Emma Watson is for sure winning some awards next year.
Every one of the actors did a great job bringing the characters  to life. I was amaze by the great performances.
I was as well. Definitely one of the best movies of 2017
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Lion King when you were younger?
Yes, that's my favorite child hood movie.
My favorite character was Simba, what about you?
I liked Nala, but the Hyenas were really good too.
I hated the Hyenas and Scar.
Scar was mean but I think the Hyenas were just misunderstood.
I'll have to watch it again soon, maybe I won't be as scared.
What scared you about the Lion King?
The scene in the elephant grave yard was scary!
True, but at least it wasn't a long scene!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Bambi?
It was a great film
I liked the way it showed nature
It was also cool to see how the deer grew up
It was probably accurate on a deer's life
i would not want to be a deer that is being hunted
Didn't the mom get shot?
She might have
You aren't supposed to shoot does.
No
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the movie Alice in Wonderland?
oh yea, surpringly I haven't seen the older version, only the new one
well, that doesn't matter too much, the core concept is the same
if you say so
so what's the most memorable moment from the movie, you think?
umm, I think the cat was quite memorable
you meanthe cat that smoke Hookar?
yeah, not a healthy cat, was it?
haha, no. But I agree the cat made quite a impression on me, it can somehow walk in different realm
yea
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana?
Isn't Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson in that?
He sure is. He plays the demigod Maui and is hilarious in it. He even sings!
How's the music in Moana?
The music is great! "How Far I'll Go" was nominated for an Oscar. Moana was also nominated for Best Animated Feature.
Wow! That's impressive.
I think the most impressive thing is how lifelike they were able to make the Polynesian islands look.
Really? The scenery is that good?
It's AMAZING.
I guess I need to check it out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched one of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" series movies. It was such an amazing experience. I really loved Johnny !
Oh yes. It's an amazing series. Which one did you watch ?
I watched the "The Curse of the Black Pearl". I especially liked the way it ended. What a climax !
Is this the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" you ever watched ? Wow, this one released in 2003. You are 14 years too late.
Oh common ! I was not watching it for the first time. In fact, I have watched all five of them many times.
Thank God ! I was wondering if you are at all living and keeping up with the real world.
Which one is your favorite one ? Mine is the 2nd one which was released in 2006.
Oh. Dead Man's Chest is it ? I liked that one as well. However, my favorite remains the one which was released in 2011; On Stranger Tides.
Well...Honestly, it's do difficult to tell one over the other. All of them are pretty good. Do you know, if they are planning to bring the 6th one sometime in future ?
Though, I am not very sure. But, I heard rumors that they were planning to shoot the 6th one back to back the 5th one. If that's to be believed, we might have another treat in 2018 !
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Inside Out?
Yes, but hasn't it been around for a while?
Yes, it came out in 2015.
Who is in the movie?
Amy Poehler stars in the film.
I will have to rent the movie.
You can rent the movie at Family Video.
Can I stream it?
Yes, it is available on iTunes, YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Video, or Vudu. It will cost though.
Thank you for the information. You have been very helpful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the movie the Lady and the Tramp?
It´s one of the most romantic animated films?
Why do you say so?
There is scene where they are having an Italian dinner with a very romantic background.
Why is it called the Lady and the Tramp?
Because the female dog was brought up with manners, like a Lady and the male one was more like a street kind of guy.
Do you think the Lady was spoiled?
Oh yes she was! She still slept with her owners when she was an adult.
I remember in the movie that she worried, do you remember why?
Because of the new baby, she thought she was being replaced.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite scene from aladdin?
I like when the genie does the whole flight attendant routine.
That's hilarious, my favorite is the scene where the genie and the rug are playing chess.
Have you seen the Emporer's new groove?
Yes... about 100 times, it's my favorite.
Mine too, Kronk cracks me up... " I got that there Izma ... "
My favorite part is " yaaaaaay I'm llama again.... wait... "
Haha, yeah there are a lot of funny scenes in that movie.
Have you seem the sword in the stone?
Oh, yes.. I love that one to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Holes was a really good movie
I know the scene where tehy went on the mountain was cool
it was and they ate all of the sweet onions and had water
and then the lizards would not bite them because they ate the ontions
and when they found the treasure that was neat
it was and they found out they were related
that part was neat, digging all of those holes was pointless
it was, they really wanted that treasure though
I always wondered how that lake dried up
maybe there was a curse on it, like most Disney movies
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see they are coming out with an Incredibles 2?
I have waited so long for it.
I know, but I am excited.
Do you think FroZone will be in it?
With his suit and his funny wife?
I loved when his wife said, "I am the best best you will ever get".
That always cracks me up.
Do you think they will show the kids as older or still young?
I hope at least the baby is able to talk and help.
Would be funny if the seamstress let the baby have a cape, since she was so against them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What disney movies do you remember as a kid?
I remember when the Rescuers came out.
The Rescuers? I am not sure I remember that one.
It was great! It was about these Rescue Aid Society that helped abducted victims around the world.
Who were the characters?
Miss Bianca recruits Bernard, both of which are mice, to rescue Penny, a little orphan girl from the mean and devious Madam Medusa, a treasure hunter from Paris.
So these mice go rescue a girl from a madwoman?
Well it is a bit more detailed than that. The enlist the help of an albatross named Orville and a dragonfly named Evinrude to help them.
I have never seen this movie.
You must get it! It is one of the forgotten ones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was humming that song to "The Lion King" this morning.
Which one?  Hakuna matata?
Yes, it got stuck in my head while driving.
That's a good movie we should watch it later.
Yes it has been years since I saw it.
I had a plush toy "Simba" when I was growing up.
Me too!  I watched that movie so many times - my copy wore out.
I know, I had a poster of Jonathon Taylor Thomas on my wall!
Oh right.  He played Simba.
Ya, I had a huge crush on him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i wish i was a kid again
Why would you want to be a kid again
Because it is fun and stuff
Any specific reasons
Well Disney had better output then tbh
I guess
I am for reals
i know you are
i wish they made as many still
They make some though
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last Disney movie you saw.
I saw The Pirates of the Caribbean movie
What did you think?  Was it any good.
I haven't really been a fan of the whole franchise, but it was decent
I saw Beauty and the Beast last week?
What did you think?
I thought it was really good.  I thought everyone did a great job?
How was Emma Watson?  She's hot!
She did a great job.  Her voice was really good.
Glad to hear that, I'll have to see it soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like this new trend of taking animated Disney movies and making them into live action movies.
Me, too. I trust Disney to do it right.
I know what you mean. Not everyone can be trusted.
I have seen too many studios try to redo my favorite childhood movies and bomb.
Yeah, and it kills a bit of my childhood when that happens!
I hear you.
Cinderella the animated one, was a huge part of my childhood.
Now that's a live action movie.
Great cast, too.The king is played by Derek Jacobi, a noted Shakespearean actor.
Yep, Disney sure does it right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you a fan of Peter Pan?
The Disney cartoon?
Yeah, did you like it?
I never really watched it, but I loved Hook growing up.
Oh, yeah.  Hook was a good movie.
I loved the setting.  It looked like the coolest place to be.
Yeah, treehouses everywhere.
Weren't ther like some kind of skateboard like transportation?
Yeah, I think so.  I loved when they ate.
Yes, the pretend food and the food fights!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The kids and I watched Moana today.
How did you like it?
It was really good.  I had no idea Dwayne Johnson sang that well.
I remember he sang really well in The Mysterious Island.
Oh yeah, with the ukulele!  I'd forgotten that.
I can see why.  It's the berry scene that sticks in my memory.
That's always what I think of first too.
Was Moana worth seeing in the theater?
Yes, I think it was.  Even if you have a big television, you can see the artwork better on the movie screen.
Maybe I'll take my kids next week.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know my kids watched the movies a lot so I wonn't forget.
Ya so did my kids, remember the birthday party we had for Amy?
Ya I loved that you had the Frozen soundtrack playing in the background.
Ya her favorite song is still Let it Go.
Ya I've heard her sing the whole song.
Ya I'm sure we all have it memorized.
I think my favorite part of the movie is when we meet Olaf.
Ya I love Olaf he is probably my favorite character
Same here he was really funny.
Ya I love his song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved the Disney movie Little Mermaid.
Oh me too, Ariel was wonderful.
That was a story based on a book by Hans Christian Anderson.
Yes, it was called The Mermaid.
Ursalla was my favorite villan.
Yea she was mean, and all that black ink that came out of her was cool.
It had beautiful animation.
It really did!
Ariel wanted to be human.
Yea and I want to be a mermaid, we could switch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Disney movies?
I like them, I think that the writers have a lot of creativity.
Really? what Disney movie is your favorite?
I like the new Star War movies, but I dont really have a favorite, what about you?
Well I like the Car's series I think those dmovies are pretty great.
Yeah they are, its crazy how Disney has evolved in its movies.
Yeah it is, they´ve grown at a really fast pace.
I like that theres a lot of creativity involved in the making of the movies.
I like the sound effects that the movies have.
I think we can agree to say that Disney has a lot of intereting movie proyects.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Disney princess?
Snow White is my favorite. She is the fairest of them all!
I am not a Snow White fan. Do you just like her, or are you a fan of the movie as well?
The movie is one of my favorites. Why don't you like her?
She's ok but I don't like her singing voice. I do like how she treats the dwarfs though.
That is a shame, I love her singing voice. Let me ask you: who is your favorite Disney princess?
I would have to say Pocahontas, though I know she isn't exactly a princess.
Oh I love Pocahontas!
Yeah she is a really neat character. I like the princesses that aren't so "damsel in distress."
I love the Colors of the Wind!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the part in The Little Mermaid when Sebastian is stuck in the kitchen with the French chef?
Yeah, why?
That's my favorite part!
Haha!  Why?
I took French in high school, so when the French chef is saying things to him, I know what he is saying.
Really?  I never thought about it.  Like what?
Like he says "zut" which is French for "darn!"
Cool.
And the song "Les poissons" means "the fish".
Oh I get it now!  "Les poissons les poissons, how I love les poissons".
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you ready for The Incredibles 2 to come out?
Whoa, the Incredibles is getting a sequel??
Yeah! It comes out in 2018!
Dude, that's amazing! The first one was so good.
I quote that movie all the time, especially the intro.
The line about feeling like the maid cracks me up every time.
Oh and the super suit line! "I am your wife, I am the greatest good you are ever gonna get!"
Frozone was truly a comedic genius.
I hope they don't mess it up with a sequel, do you know what it's going to be about yet?
Not sure, but it's the same director and he said he'd never do a sequel unless he had an idea, so I'm excited.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seen any Disney movies lately?
I saw the incredibles.
Oh will Holly Hunter?
Yeah.
That is one of my favorite disney movies!
Mine too. I love the superhero aspect.
I also love the short film before the actual movie.
Oh the one with the rabbit?
Me too, I always laugh so hard.
I have to see that again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the new Disney movie Star Wars: The last Jedi.
DId you enjoy it?
Yes, it was just as good as Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Wow, I'll have to go and see it myself then.
My favorite part about it is seing Luke Skywalker at the end.
Luke comes back into this series?
He does but since it's not until the very end you don't know what his role will be in the story.
Now that IS an interesting turn of story.
I can hardly wait until the next episode is released.
I'd better hurry and see this one on the big screen in theaters then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder what happened to Hallie Mills.
Who is that?
She was a child star for some Disney movies. She was in Parent Trap and Pollyanna in the 1960's.
I thought Lindsay Lohan was in that movie.
She was in the remake in 1998 but I don't think she was as good as Hallie Mills was.
I didn't see the first one but I thought Lindsay was pretty good.
Yeah, she was good but Hallie made me want to have a twin sister.
If I had a twin sister I would have blamed everything I broke on her when I was growing up.
Hallie had a younger sister named Juliet Mills she was an actress also she was in The Nanny and the Professor.
Well, I think you may be telling your age right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lion's King is the best Disney movie of all time.
I'd debate you on any other day but you got me in a good mood.
What can you even debate, it's absolutely perfect.
Can't argue that it's perfect, really.
Exactly, the characters, the music, the story, the visuals, it's the best.
Agreed, Akuna Matata is the best Disney song ever.
One of them that's for sure, I Just Can't Wait To Be King is just as good if not better.
Oh I forgot about that one.
How can you forget the best song in the movie?
By thinking of another great song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Snow White is such a classic movie
I think it is one of my favorites, the witch was pretty scary though
she was and I was alway worried apples could be poisoned after watching this
which dwarf was your favorite? I liked sleepy he was cute
I liked grumpy, he reminded me of an old grumpy man
I thought the glass casket they put her in was creepy but pretty also
I think so also, they were trying to preserve her body
I wish I had a mirror that could tell me things
that would be neat, but it may make a person obsessive after awhile
snow white was the fairest in the land, I am sure that drove the witch crazy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yeah, those were pretty catchy.
Did you ever see them at Disneyland?
Who, Anna and Elsa?
Yeah.
Nah, way too expensive to go there.  What about yourself?
We took our daughter there three years ago.  It was a four hour line!
No way I could ever stand in line that much!
My husband did the standing, I ended up playing in the park with her.
Man, you owe him something for that.
Yeah, it was super nice of him to do that for us.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Princess protection program?
No, it was s good movie
Who was in it
Selena gomez and demi lovato
I love them
Me too
What was it about?
A girls dad worked for the frpbi and a princess had to come live with them because she was in danger
That sounds good
It was
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you find the Jungle Book 2 annoying?
It wasnt neccesary.
I dont think that I learned much from it.
Mowgli was best in the first one.
That first one was amazing especially the scenes in the jungle.
Yeah I think they combined the acting with the singing really well.
It spawned alot of other movies.
I do not remember anyone getting a spin off?
No but they got some sitcom like shows.
Wow, I didnt think it was that big of a flick to start.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was with the whole Frozen thing?
That movie was a juggernaut.
I don't get it, how was it so popular?
Little girls just ate it up. Everyone wanted to be Elsa.
No kidding, the costumes were everywhere.
Credit were it's due though. Olaf was a good villain.
Josh Gad. He's something of a hidden talent.
Speaking of hidden talents, Duke was Alan Tudyk.
He's genius in everything.
Absolutely. His acting is good, but his voiceovers are beyond comparison.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney Movie?
I don't like Disney
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT!?
Just like I did - I open my mouth and say those words in that order
I mean... everyone likes Disney movies!
Haha!  Lighten up bro!
How can I when you say that!?
I was just kidding!
Don't do that to me, bro!
Sorry haha!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I never got to watch the entire Alice in Wonderland movie.
I did when I was little.
I only ever saw pieces of the movie.
I don't remember much. Except I'm late for an important date.
That's funny. Was that the Mad Hatter.
Yes.
What was the deal with the two huge playing cards?
I really don't remember.
Well, some night we will have to watch it together.
Sounds good. I'll bring popcorn.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get a chance to watch Toy Story 3?
Yes, I did. It was my favorite Toy Story.
That ending at the incinerator was pretty dark for a kid's movie.
I agree with you. It was so emotional.
Do you remember what it was rated?
I think it was rated G.
It should have been PG.
I can see what you are saying. Lotso himself should have made it PG.
Seriously, what a horrible character!
And yet I've seen Lotso dolls at the Disney store. Go figure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I agree, the songs were quite catchy and something that sticks in your mind.
Yes, I caught myself singing them for no reason after seeing the movie.
I really loved the characters in the movie too.
Me too, I hope they bring most of them back next time.
The video quality was really good too.
I know it made you feel like you were a part of that world.
You got such an emotional attachment to the characters too.
Yes, the writers did a great job of getting the audience involved.
I hope the next movie goes even further into a storyline.
Yes, sometimes the sequels on these movies just don't work out as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite disney movie?
Frozen, definitely
My kids and i have seen that so many times
Its really good
My favorite character is Olaf
Hes so cute
Do you have a favorite character?
Ana
I like her too
Shes so brave
XXXXXXXXXXX
What folktale do you think Disney's going to go for next?
What do you mean?
Well, they just did Moana...
Hey, it's not all folktales, you know? Alice in Wonderland and Chronicles of Narnia were classic books.
True, true. Still, sometimes it seems like the reason they're redoing them in live action is that they've run out of ideas.
No, they haven't. They've just been doing other things, like Born In China.
Right, their environmental things. They're alright.
I love seeing those baby animals!
It's kind of interesting how people and animals are so similar.
We are animals, technically.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to watch The Little Mermaid with me later tonight?
Wow, I havent thought about that movie in ages! Yes, lets watch!
Ariel was always my favorite, she is a strong female character.
Really? I liked Prince Eric more!
Thats because he was handsome and kind!
Exactly! Most young girls love seeing a dreamy prince that can save them!
Dont forget she had the help of her friends, Sebastian and Flounder to beat Ursula.
You're right! They did make quite a team!
The songs were all amazing too! Especially "Part of your world"
That was my favorite too!! Lets go watch it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Muppets movie?
The Muppet Christmas Carol.
That was a good one.
Michael Caine as Scrooge, come on!
That guy is good in everything.
Kermit as Bob Cratchet was priceless.
They always put "Kermmy" in such fitting roles.
I hope they do another Muppets soon.
I heard they were going to do the show again.
That would be Awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh my gosh, I can't believe that they are making a Cars 3.
I know I love those movies.
Me too, they are one of my favorite Disney Movies.
I love Mater and the story line is so good. Who is your favorite character.
My favorite is Lightning McQueen.
Ya I like him too. I hope that number 3 lives up to the rest.
Ya number 2 was ok, not as good as number 1 so we will see.
Ya. There is just something very nostalgic about it, even though it is not that old.
Ya, I feel like it takes you back to a simpler time.
Exactly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Dumbo last night.
When was that released?
1941.
Wasn't it very short?
Only 64 minutes.
Who was the voice of Dumbo?
Dumbo did not talk.  The mouse talked.  Edward Brophy.
Does any elephant talk?
Verna Felton is the voice of the matriarch.
Neat.  I might see it again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Scar is my all-time favorite Disney villain.
Scar? You think he's a better villain than Hades?
Hades? You like Hades better?
I mean, he is the King of the Underworld.
That is a more impressive title. Scar was so compelling though.
Hades is just really funny.
I haven't seen Hercules in a long time.
You should give it another shot! It's totally worth it.
Want to watch it with me?
Sure. How about Saturday?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I always loved to watch Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs when I was little.
That was one of my favorites, too! I loved all the cute animals.
The dwarfs were pretty cute, too.
Dopey is definitely the cutest.
I liked Dopey, but Bashful has always been my favorite.
The way Bashful blushes is very adorable! Even Grumpy is cute.
For someone named Grumpy, he's not that bad after all!
I'm glad the Evil Queen lost in the end, and I was very glad she didn't hurt the dwarfs.
Yes, I would have actually been more upset if something happened to the dwarfs than Snow White.
Snow White was a nice person, though. At least she ended up safe!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new live action version of Beauty and the Beast?
Not yet. Have you?
Yes, I saw it last weekend with my friends.
How was it?
I loved it! Emma Watson was fantastic as Belle.
She is such a great actress. Who played the Beast?
Dan Stevens. He was really good too.
I will have to make plans to go see it soon.
You really should! I highly recommend it to everyone.
Thanks for the tip. I think I will buy tickets to Beauty and the Beast for this coming weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know... there's days I completely forget Disney owns Star Wars and Marvel.
I know what you mean. I never imagined either being anything more than their own company.
It was quite ingenious though. They make an incredible team.
Yeah, with Disney's financial and creative resources they're really killing it with all the new films.
Not just that but have you heard about the theme parks?
No, what?
Both Star Wars and Marvel are getting their own lands now. They might even be opened already or opening soon.
No way! That's like a nerd's dream come true!
So in the real world we get truly the most magical place and in the cinematic universe we have Episode VIII, Boba Fett, Han Solo, Black Panther, and Captain Marvel to look forward to also.
Don't forget some really great sequels: Thor Ragnarok and Ant Man and the Wasp. Which other than Infinity War is one I'm looking forward to most.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the storyline for the movie WALL-E?
I thought that it was very realistic and sent a good message about environmental conservation.
Do you think that it went over the heads of kids?
No because WALL-E was a very relatable robot that kids really loved and they just happened to learn about protecting the environment along the way.
That's true. The fact that WALL-E goes to rescue EVE, a plant, is very important to the plot.
Yes, and in the movie the existence of EVE shows that life on Earth is still possible.
Yes, I think it shows that humans should never let the Earth fall into disarray to begin with.
In the end, WALL-E has to visit the large ship to rescue EVE, and it shows the future race of humans as extremely lazy, all of them with robot butlers.
Yes, these scenes are funny but I think adults see the ominous warnings about dependence on technology more than kids would.
I agree. That's one aspect of the movie that adults would find more interesting than the kid's would.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the ne Cars 3 movie?
Not really. I didn't like the second one.
You didn't? I thought Cars 1 and 2 were great.
I really loved Cars 1. I don't know, maybe Cars 3 will be a good movie.
What did you not like about Cars 2?
It didn't really grab my attention as well as the first one.
I see. Well, I cannot wait to see Cars 3.
Are you excited for any other movies coming out?
Yes, I also can't wait for Wreck It Ralph 2.
Me neither! That is going to be a great movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Inside Out?
I absolutely love that movie! It's from both Disney and Pixar.
Yes and when I went to see it with my kids I cried in the middle of the theater.
Me too, I was blubbering like a baby when Bing Bong died.
It did such a good job of delving into the mind of a young girl and what she was going through.
I heard they employed psychologists to help with the script.
I heard that too, and you can definitely tell.
The animation is good, the comedy is on point, it has the heartfelt element.
And it's very original. The only thing you can compare it to is that old show Herman's Head.
Oh I used to watch that. But I think Inside Out is definitely more interesting and colorful than that ever was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Cinderella any good.
It was ok i'm kinda tired of every princesses always needing a prince to save them.
Well when you think about it these Disney movies are based off old fables.
That is true just kinda wish there was a princess that didn't need a prince to save them.
Oh come on there are plenty of princess that was not saved by a prince Mulan, Frozen, Brave.
Brave isn't Disney?
Well no the less she was a princess that was strong.
I see that is true I stand corrected.
Hey you wanna do a Disney marathon?
Yes I would love to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana?
Like a hundreded times my kids loved that movie.
I really like the fact that Disney is telling real stories from around the world.
They are also really focused on female leads.
Yes that is amazing isn't it.
Hey who played Maui in the movie?
Dwayne Johnson.  You know "The Rock" from wrestling.
Oh yeah.  Do you smell what the rock is cooking?
Yeah that's him.  If you pay attention when he meets Moana he gives her the 'people's brow'
That's hilarious I'm going to have to go watch it again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
HEY FRED. I JUST GOT BACK FROM A SPECIAL SCREENING OF THE NEW DISNEY MOVIE POCAHANTAS.
DO YOU THINK ITS AS GOOD AS THE OTHERS FROM THAT STUDIO
IF ANYTHING ITS BETTER.THE COLOR IS SO MUCH BRIGHTER
HOW ABOUT THE MUSIC.
ITS GREAT AS USUAL .AND SOME OF IT IS PLAYED SO LOUDLY,LIKE WITH THE DRUMS.
THAT ALWAYS HELPS SELL THE DISNEYS DOESNT IT.
AND THE STORY LINE. ITS ALMOST HISTORICAL
LIKE THE REAL MEETING OF POCAHANTAS  AND JOHN SMITH
THE ONLY PART I DIDNT LIKE WAS HER GOING BACK TO ENGLAND WITHOUT SMITH.
YEAH,BUT I FEEL CERTAIN THEY WERE IN FOREVER LOVE.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the movie Ratatouille.
It is really fun. It made me crave Italian food.
Me too. It was very cute.
The main human character reminded me of my friend.
Oh yeah? That's funny. There are many memorable characters in that one.
Yeah, that little chef was so funny.
I did not think he would be such a bad guy.
But, in the end, everything worked out.
Yes, I'm glad that reviewer liked the food.
I did not see that coming.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever hear of the movie Chicken Little that Disney did?
I remember Chicken Little! I didn't realize that was a Disney film.
It sure was. I loved that movie.
Didn't they have all kinds of other neat characters in it?
Yep. There was the Ugly Duckling, Foxy Loxy and a bunch of others.
I seem to remember that movie kind of running on and getting a little random.
Yes. It opened really well at the box office, yet it did get a few less-than-stellar reviews.
What did critics say about it?
Well, some critics basically said that the storyline could have been developed better.
It was still a fun movie, though. I remember Patrick Stewart was in it, too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Disney cartoon growing up?
I really liked their animated version of Robin Hood.
I don't think I had seen that one.
It's older.  I think it was from the seventies.
Did it follow the Robin Hood story line?
Pretty much, except the characters were animals.  Robin Hood was a fox.
Was it good?
Oh, we had it on VHS and we watched it like every week.
So it really was one of your favorites.
Yeah, I'm surprised you'd never seen it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the most romantic Disney film of all time?
The Lady and the Tramp.
Wow, really?
Yes, that dinner scene is extremely romantic.
I never looked at spaghetti the same way after that.
Lady was such a beautiful character!
Yeah, I wanted a dog like her after I saw that movie.
The Scottish terrier was really funny.
Oh yeah, Jock?
Yeah, he was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
My favorite is definitely Aladdin! I love that movie!
That's so old fashioned! I meant something new, like Frozen or Rapunzel.
I like some of the newer movies, but I think I prefer the old fashioned ones.
What's so great about that out-dated animation?
There's something so charming about it, the traditional animation over the digital animation, the characters, and most importantly, the story-telling.
The story telling? What's so different about animated story-telling versus digital story-telling?
It isn't the visuals. It's just that, I don't know, the plots were explained better, the characters were more developed. Things were explained to children more in the past, whereas now the movies also geared toward adults.
I guess you're right. Children don't know the difference between old school cartoons and CGI animations, but adults do.
My point exactly! The technology has evolved for adults, not children. Children will always enjoy a good cartoon no matter what the format. Adults, not so much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your favorite Disney characters?
Any parameters, or can I choose any at all?
Hmmm... How about favorite from the movies in the last 10 years.
Ok, how many can I choose?
Five
That's it?? That's so hard!!
I know, that's what makes it fun!
Ok, so I'll go with... Baymax, Moana, Thor, Captain America and Anna from Frozen
Thor and Captain America are Marvel, not Disney!
Marvel is owned by Disney so they count!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hello
Whats cracking
Just some movies
What ones
Mickey mouse
I love mickey
He is the best
I dont like the new cartoons though
They are meh
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched my favorite Disney movie ever!
What was it?
Big Hero 6!
Aww, Baymax.
He is just so great and cuddly. I want my own Baymax.
But when the brother died I cried so much.
That was so sad. I wasn't expecting it.
He was such a good guy and then the guy he went in to save wasn't even in need of help.
That made me so mad!
He died for nothing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mark what's happening man?
Not much just getting ready to take the kids to go see the new "Beauty and the Beast" movie
Wow the girls wanted to see that mind if I tag along with them?
Yeah that would be awesome Maddie and Elizabeth wanted to see Clara and Maggie
Okay i'll get them ready and meet you at the theatre
Make sure they dress up as Belle
How come?
The Theatre is having a contest for best Belle costume
Man the girls will enjoy that I'll get them ready now
Cool see you soon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Am I the only person in the world who was not crazy about Aladdin?
Really?  I thought Robin Williams was great as Genie
He was.  I liked Aladdin too, but Jasmine really annoyed me.
Was it her voice?  I like Linda Larkin in everything except Aladdin the movie.
Her voice was a big part.  But I also thought she came on to Aladdin super strong.
I think they were still using that group of artists that really sexualized everything.
The ones who hid the naughty pictures in The Little Mermaid and The Lion King?
Yes.  Don't quote me on it, but I think it was them.
I wonder if they did The Little Mermaid 2 too?  Did you notice Ariel was about to pop out of her top?
I'd forgotten that.  I never bothered to watch The Little Mermaid 3.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let it goooo, let it goooo...
Omg, are you singing the frozen song?
Yes, i love it.
That is a great song by the way.
Totally agree. Which version is your favorite?
Well, i guess i'm picking the one from Demi Lovato.
Really? She's good but i think i like Idina Menzel more.
Both of them are really great singers
I know, i hope Disney decides to release a sequel.
Actually, they are doing it. I hope it doesn't take too long!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney movies were made in the 1990's?
I know that many that became musical theater productions were made then.
The Lion King debuted in 1994.
I loved "The Lion King". My middle school chose that as their musical.
What was your character from the movie?
I was Simba. It was a good part.
I think "The Little Mermaid" came out in 1989.
It was close to the 1990's.
"The Little Mermaid" is still popular today with elementary students.
I agree. It would be hard to forget Ursula.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see the Newest Pirates of the Caribbean Movie?
I am not sure, when does it come out?
It is out now, and it is supposed to be really good.
How many movies are there in that series?
I believe this is number 5, can you believe that?
A lot of people really like it, I wonder how many characters will be back?
I know that Johnny Depp will be in it, of course. I am not sure who else.
I wonder if it will be funny still, or if they have run out of jokes.
I think it will be really funny, especially with the monkey.
I don't know about the monkey, I guess I'll have to watch a trailer about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes I did. Have you seen it.
No not yet, I don't think it will be as good as the original.
I thought it was so nice to see Belle's beautiful dress, and see the Mrs. Pots, Chip, Lumier and Cogsworth come to life.
I just didn't like how they made Cogsworth, Lumier and the maid feather duster look. I don't think they look as good as the original. Also, the CGI effects for the beast are very unrealistic.
I really liked how everyone came to life, and they even made the songs like "Be Our Guest" look excellent!
I am also not very happy about the added story line at the beginning of the movie. I don't think they needed to add a scene about her mothers death in a children's movie. It wasn't in the original and it doesn't make the movie better at all.
I think it is good to see the back story behind Belle and her father, but it is a little much for a children's movie.
Maybe I will see it I really like the sound track of the movie. Belle, the beast and Gaston did such a good job singing and the song "tale as old as time" when Belle and the beast are dancing sounds so romantic!
I agree the soundtrack is beautiful, I think you should see it so you can compare every part of it to the origional!
XXXXXXXXXXX
disney or Pixar?
I like Pixar better
I like Disney better.
pixar has better graphics and characters
disney had all the classics though
I guess they were nostalgic for you
yeah. lion king was my favorite.
that was a great movie
yeah, that reminds me of my childhood
one of their best
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey my daughter wants to watch something called Frozen, is that a good idea?
Yeah, how has she not seen it? Everyone has seen it.
Well not my daughter, what is it about?
Its about a girl who can freeze things with her hands, and some other stuff too.
Oh yeah, is this the one with all the ice in it?
Yeah thats the one, in the sort of fictional Scandinavian country.
Is it funny?
Yeah there's a lot of humor in it, both for kids and even a bit for adults?
Its a Disney movie, does anyone die?
Yeah, the parents drown in the ocean after their ship sinks, so, there's that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie? You should, with the kids.
Did you like it?
I did, it was a wonderful remake.
You're not the first person who has told me that.
The effects were stunning and Emma Watson is a wonderful actress.
I think I'll buy it for my kids the next time we go out.
Definitely one of those movies you're going to want to keep around.
I kept all of my Disney movies my whole childhood.
Same with me, I think my parents still have a few down in the basement.
I'm excited, this was a remake I was very excited about. Nice to hear they did it the right way!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what are you listening to, on your headphones?
I am listening to the song: "Under the sea"
Oh, Isn't that song from the Disney movie: Little mermaid?
Yes, it is!
Wow, that is an old movie, that came out in 1989!
Ya, it was a long time ago, but I really miss some of the songs in it.
Oh, I sang my fair play of "Little mermaid" songs in school plays.
My favourite character in the movie is Sebastian.
Mine was Prince Eric
Didn't know you are a Disney fan too. Let's go watch it again, I have in on dvd.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Wizard of Oz was a real classic film
I know, I liked that each character was missing something and had to find it
they had to get it from the wizard
like the lion needed a brain and the Tin man needed a heart
and Dorthy had to get home somehow
the ruby red slippers were so pretty
they were, remember the bad witch had them on when she was under the house?
yes, that part was crazy, the good witch was pretty
I wish I could find a yellow brick road
There was something really magical about that movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen moana
I have.  just got it for the kids
I don't know about you, but I really like the rock
YOU'RE WELCOME

I just think it's a beautiful move overall
yes, the colors and the sea are very pretty
my youngest daughter wants to go as her to halloween this year
oh, I'm sure by then, there will be another princess to get into
totally
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to watch some  movie. Can you provide me some suggestions?
What kind of genre you want to watch?
Any animated movie would work.
Any other preference that you have?
It should be a top rated movie. Preferably in Top 250 of Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB).
You can watch Up. It is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen.
What is the plot?
It's a story of an old man named Carl who gets stuck with a boy when he is trying to fly by tying balloons to his house.
Oh! It sounds very interesting.
Yes, watch it. It is full of emotions and comedy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know they are remaking Dumbo?
No, I did not know that.
Yes it is going to be a real life version.
That's cool, I loved Dumbo. Do you know who is in it?
I know eva green, and danny devito.
They are both enjoyable to watch should be interesting.
yes, I just hope they don't ruin it.
Well the animated disney version will always exist. they can't change that masterpiece.
Good way to look at it the disney original is always rewatchable.
That it is. I love the baby mine song, wonder if they will include any of the original music in the remake.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you have a favorite Disney movie growing up?
Hmm, I had a lot of favorites. What was yours?
Mine was Lion King.
Lion King is a classic. I don't know if it's my favorite though.
Well, what is your favorite then?
I liked Mulan and The Little Mermaid.
Yeah, Mulan is one of the best.
My new favorite is Princess and the Frog.
I like that one too!
I'll never get enough of these movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm looking forward to the new Little Mermaid.
There's a new Little Mermaid?
Yes, it's going be live action.
That sounds interesting.
Yeah, curious how they plan to do the underwater stuff.
Me too, especially Ursula.
Right?!  Her and Triton.
Exactly, maybe CGI those charcters.
Probably, it should be fun.
Exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the new Beauty and the Beast movie recently came out on Blu Ray and DVD?
Yes, I actually even pre-ordered it because I wanted it so much!
I love the new songs in this version of the movie.
Which one is your favorite?
I really like the song in the tavern about Gaston, especially the new additions with the lines LeFou adds.
Yes, I like the line where he talks about not being able to spell Gaston's name.
I think Josh Gad might have improvised a lot of those lines like that one. I know he did that when he played Olaf in Frozen.
Really? Well, he must be pretty creative then!
I also enjoy how the character of LeFou has been developed more from the animated version.
Yes, he doesn't seem quite so evil in this one, like he might actually have a conscience.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Moana?
No I haven't, what is it about?
It is about a girl who needs to save her island
Island? Where is it based?
It is based in Polynesia. I don't think that it is a real island, but it takes inspiration from islands such as Samoa.
So its like Lilo and Sitch?
Similar, but it is based upon traditional stories from the Islands, including that of Maui
Who is Maui?
Maui is the demi god of air and water
It sounds so good, I'm going to watch it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My son and I were talking about his favorite childhood movies.
Really, and he remembers them.
Some of them. He does remember his favorite.
What was that?
A Goofy Movie.
Do you mean Goofy as from Mickey Mouse.
Yes, but Goofy had his own movie.
I never knew that.
It was okay, but my son loved Goofy so we bought it.
That's cute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How come you did not like "Frozen"?
I think it was underrated.
I actually liked it. I did like the music.
The only reason "Frozen" was popular was there were no other family movies showing at that time.
Is that true? I will have to look that up. Do you think that's how "Frozen" got so popular?
Yes. And I am telling you, it's overrated.
Okay. Is that - is that a "Frozen" backpack you are carrying?
Yeah, it is. I like Olaf.
You are putting down "Frozen" but you are buying the merchandise?
Well, I like Olaf.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Fox and the Hound?
No, when?
It's old, from when we were kids.
What was it about again?
The lady found the baby fox, and he became best friends with the hunting dog!
Oh yeah! Wasn't that a sad movie?
Yeah, when she had to release the fox into the wild it got sad.
I feel like like I cried a little bit haha!
I definitely cried. But it was one of my favorites.
I can understand why.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
It's one that most people haven't seen.  My favorite is The Brave Little Toaster.
You're right, I haven't seen that.  What is it about?
It came out a while ago, back in the 80s I think.  Basically these appliances are trying to find their owner.
Sounds a little weird.  I'll have to check it out though.  You know another Disney movie I don't hear talked about? The Great Mouse Detective.
Oh yeah I've seen that one.  I remember liking it as a kid.
My favorite has always been The Fox and the Hound.
That one used to always make me cry when I was little.
Me too but the little fox and hound are so cute!
It was always really sad when the lady had to take the fox and leave him in the woods.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you saw the Tarzan's movie from Disney ?
Yes. I love this movie ! My favorite part is when Tarzan meets his mother again .
I watched The beauty and the beast yesterday , i liked it so much that i watched it a second time today .
I watched it too ! It was at friend's house . My friend loves the beast and i don't know why .
Do you remember that movie we were watching when we where kids ? You know, the mermaid ?
Oh, you mean the little mermaid ? Yes , i was watching it everyday when i was 6 years old.
When does the Cinderella movie came out ?
I heard it was in 1950 .
What is your favourite Disney movie ?
Clearly the first Toy Story movie ! It was the third time i was watching a Disney movie and i just really sticked with this one .
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, seen any good Disney movies lately?
Let's see.. I saw Moana not too long ago, it was really neat.
Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.
Yeah, it's guys The Rock voicing a character in it, so that's pretty cool.
Yeah, I've seen previews for it.  I rented Zootopia not too long ago.
Oh, what did yout hink?
Actually, I could not get through it.  I'd gotten the disc from the library and it keep stopping on me because it was so scratched up.
Really/  That's sucks.  Did you try cleaning it?
Yeah, I did but that didn't fix it.  I dunno if it's true or not, but i read someone that Sony DVDs are REAL sensitive to scratches.  Supposedly if I'd bought a $50 cheap DVD player I wouldn't have that problem.
I assuming you mean "$50" was cheap for when you first bought your player, because you can DVD players for like $25 nowdays.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the anime movie Mulan?
Yes it was a great movie, my friend suggested it and we watched it together.
That movie sure had a great story and wonderful animation.
I loved Mulan for her determination and grit.
I felt bad for her seeing her struggle amongst the males.
But she did save her people.
That's true, her courage was something else.
I heard Mulan is being made into real life production.
Wow, that's great news. When is it releasing and I wonder how good will it be?
It is slated for release  some time around November, 2018
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does the new Cars movie come out?
I think it's really soon. It should be a good one.  All of the Cars movies have been good.
I liked the first one really well, but didn't like the second one as much.
I can see that.  It's just hard to beat the first one.  Getting introduced to LIghtning McQueen and Mater and all the other characters.
Yes, it's hard to beat those characters. Do you think they'll have many of the same characters in the new movie?
All that I've seen in the previews is Mater and LIghtning. I'd love to see Sarge or Doc or Sally.
Yeah!  I wonder is Lightning and Sally ever got married?
I wondered that too!  Mater is always so funny.
I think that the second movie focused more on Mater but it looks like this one is going back to Lightning.
That's what it looked like to me too. The first preview looked scary!
XXXXXXXXXXX
its been a while since i saw a disney movie
same here, man.
should we have a disney party?
sure, let's do it.
which one should we watch?
we have to watch lion king and beauty and the beast
what else?
we can watch cindarella and treasure planet.
treasure planet is so underrated
the soundtrack was great too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney cartoon?
I really like Aladdin the best.  I think the story is good.
I've always been a fan of The Lion King.
Yes, that is a good one.  I think it was released after Aladdin.
I believe so, yes.
Disney was really good there for awhile, they were untouchable.
Yeah, I miss the old style of movies.
I don't really seem them making feel good family movies anymore.
Disney has definitely changed since I was a kid.
Agreed, but I'm sure this generation loves it just like we loved it back then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Alice in Wonderland?
The cartoon or live action?
Both?
The cartoon was great. Confusing but true to Lewis Carroll.  The live action had awesome costumes.
Ha ha. I did expect mroe out of Johnny Depp at the Mad Hatter.
Did you see the sequel with Sasha Baron Cohen?
No, I just couldn't stand to be bored that long.
I thought it was better than the first one. But the cartoon is better.
Yeah, it lends itself to a cartoon.
Especially the Cheshire Cat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the new Tron remake?
I think it's good, different from the original, but good.
The graphics and animations are so much better than the original.
Yes but bear in mind that the original was made in 1982. Back then the graphics were cutting edge.
Imagine if that was you and were transported on to the grid!
It would be crazy, especially if you were riding around on those light cycles.
Yes but you would also have the battle tanks after you!
What I don't understand is how did the power remain on at Flynn's Arcade for all that time in the Tron Legacy?
I don't know... maybe his other business kept paying the bills.
Probably!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the remake of Fantasia?
No, but I've rewatched the original recently.
Did your kids like it?
I think they were kind of bored.
Really?
Yeah, kids today are used to too much talking and action.
I see what you mean.
I wonder if they would have liked the remake.
My kids were okay with it.
I might have to get a copy of that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was so happy to see that they re-released Oliver!
Really?  Why?
I remember seeing it in the theatre as a kid but they didn't release it on tape back then.
I didn't know that, I wonder why they didn't release it.
I don't know why, but I know that we would have had it if they did.  My mom even loved that movie!
Interesting.  Do you have it now?
No, but I'm planning on buying it next week.
When you do, let's have a viewing party!
Ok, that sounds like fun.  You bring the popcorn!
Ok!  "You and me together, you'll see. Forever, we'll be."
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait to see the new Beauty and the Beast live action movie on blue ray.
You didn't see it at the movie theater?
No, the timing just wasn't right. Did you see it?
Yes, and it was amazing. Seeing it on the big screen really brought it to life.
Was it as good as the original?
It was even better. Emma Watson was amazing!
How did the musical score compare to the animated version?
It was every bit as good, if not better. The  title song by Ariana Grande and John Legend was amazing.
I'm so excited to watch it tonight. I can't wait to see Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, she's one of my favorites!
You won't be disappointed! Don't forget the tissues!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Until now there’s not better animated movie than Big Heroes 6.
That's correct. Big heroes 6 it's the best in all their aspects.
All the characters have a wonderful and funny performance.
Yes, although the storyline was kind of sad, it was vey nice at the end.
I would like to have someone like Baymax.
I want one too. He's the better companion for Hiro after Tadashi's death.
I hope in a sequel Tadashi is alive as Callaghan's daughter.
I don't think so. His death was very sad but Baymax helped with tha situation.
Well, but at least a second part will be enough for the fans.
I hope so, and with the participation of Stan Lee it will be a total success.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last Disney movie you saw?
I just saw Disney's Beauty and the Beast!
How did you like it?
It was really good actually! I wasn't expecting much from it.
Why do you say that?
Because I was a fan of the original animated version. So I didn't think it would transfer over that well.
Yea? How did everything feel in the movie?
Honestly all the singing, and for the most part everything else was pretty spot on with the original. So it was really good.
Is there anything you didn't like about the new movie?
Not really, I felt they did a fantastic job. All tho the beast did look a little out of place. He just didn't seem real enough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana?
Yes! It was so good!
I know! The Rock did such a good job in it.
Yeah! You're welcome is a great song.
I sing How Far I'll Go everyday!
People are so sick of me singing it at this point!
I wonder if they'll ever make a sequel.
That'd be so cool. Disney does make a lot of sequels.
Well I would go see it right away!
So would I!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie? Mine is The Lion King.
I love The Lion King, but I cry every time Simba's dad dies!
Yes, it is literally the most heartbreaking scene in a movie.
It's worse than when Bambi's mom dies.
The music is great, though, right?
Oh definitely - who doesn't sing along with Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa?
What is your favorite song from the movie?
Probably, "I Just Can't Wait to be King!"
Did you like the sequel at all?
No, I thought The Lion King II: Simba's Pride was totally unnecessary.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of puppy are you planning to get?
You know I've always been partial to 101 Dalmatians, so I think I'm gonna have to go with a cute little spotted guy.
My little sister found a fork  when she was looking for shells at the beach.
I bet I would have started brushing my hair and singing like Ariel if I were her!
As corny as it was, I was smitten when he pull a Lady & The Tramp during dinner.
I can't believe he had you both suck on the same piece of spaghetti to a kiss, what a goof!
Even though it was years and years ago, I Pocahontas still calls when I go in the woods sometimes...
Especially in the fall!  I can paint with all the colorsss of the wiiind.
It feels like I'm just waiting for Prince Charming...
Hopefully you're not a Sleeping Beauty for too long, and he comes to kiss you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you name all the dwarves in Sleeping Beauty?
Maybe. There were 7 right?
Pretty sure. What can you name?
Dopey, Sleepy, Happy.
Wait, was  Happy one of the dwarves?
Pretty sure.
Okay, go on.
Uh, Doc, Dopey...
You already said Dopey.
That's all I can remember!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie?
Mine is definitely Beauty and the Beast!  I love that movie!
Oh yeah, that's a great one.  It has a great soundtrack, too.
I know, and all the characters are amazing.  They did a re-make recently but it was nothing like the original.
They never are.  That movie made me cry!
Yeah, it's a tearjerker.  I love Mrs. Pots and the little teacup Chip, too.
Oh yeah, they are precious.  And the candlestick is hilarious.
Yeah, all the characters are truly great in that movie.
I wish Disney was still producing movies like the old classics.
Yeah, me too.  It seems like they don't make them as good as they used to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any good live action Disney films?
Yes. There are tons as a mater of fact.
I wanna watch one with animals
How about Homeward Bound?
When was that released?
In the 1990's
Cool. Do the dogs have voices
Yes and the cat too
Who is one of the main voices?
Michael J. Fox does the voice of Chance
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Beauty and the Beast?
Loved the original animated version.
Yes, that was an instant classic. Great story and singing.
I believe it was nominated for best picture
Really? I didn't know that
Yes, even before they started doing it specifically for animated movies.
I guess it didn't win.
No, I don't recall which one won that year. I believe it was 1992
Still, I enjoy watching it now. Still holds up.
Me too. I love Mrs. Potts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It seems to me like DIsney is out of good ideas for movies.
Why do you say that?
Because of all the remakes they're coming out with.
Oh, I see. I wondered about that too.
Do you like any of them?
Beauty and the Beast was OK if you ignore the music.
I haven't seen it yet. What's wrong with the music?
Lots and lots of auto tune.
Is Emma Watson a good singer?
No. If she were why would they auto tune her?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember when Disney made the Hercules movie?
The cartoon?  Yeah.
Did you like it?
I actually never saw the movie, but I loved the animated series.
Oh, I forgot they had the series.
Yeah, I watched it every day after school.
Didn't that come out in the late 90s?
Yeah.  I was in high school and watching it if that's what you mean.
Well, I guess Disney does have a universal appeal.
It was a good cartoon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?  Mine is The Lion King.
The Lion King is pretty good, but Mulan is by far the best.  It has the strongest protagonist.
No way, she's barely even a princess.
Exactly why I like Mulan so much.  Most girls watching aren't princesses.
Yeah, but Disney movies are often about escapism and fantasy for children.  Does Mulan provide that over, say, Cinderella?
How many female soldiers do you know that overcome prejudice to save the emperor of China?
Well, fair point, but Mulan's story still seems more grounded in reality.
It is!  And that's what is amazing about it.  It is so much more human than a story like The Lion King.
Now that might be going too far, The Lion King is largely the story of Hamlet, retold with talking animals.
Well, minus the talking ghosts.  Unless we count the Whoopi Goldberg's Hyena, since she was in Ghost!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I have a lot of them.
But you can only pick one?
I guess I would have to say the Jungle Book.
Why the Jungle Book?
I'm fascinated by the boy and his ability to speak with creatures.
Did you like the most recent Jungle Book?
Yes, very much so.
What was your favorite scene?
I liked when the giant Orangutan sang.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what the first Disney movie was?
Nope, sorry. Disney's been around for a long time, it could be any of a handful of the old ones.
Like which ones?
Well it'd have to be one of the movies that they made by drawing everything out.
So something like Cinderella then maybe?
Yea that's a good guess. I don't think that was the very first one though.
Which ones were you thinking of?
Maybe Dumbo, or Bambi. Those seemed to have the old school color look, where the colors aren't as vibrant.
Oh yea those are good choices. What year do you think those came out?
A long time ago, but not too long back that color didn't exist, so maybe the early 50's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I love the Lion King. Have you ever seen it?
Yes, I love that movie too. Who is your favorite character?
Simba, of course. I also loved Timone and Pumba.
Who doesn't? Those two are hilarious.
I was always so afraid of Mufasa. He is a scary character.
I know! He was very scary in the movie.
I always thought lions were scary like Mufasa but it was good to learn they can be nice like Nala and Simba.
Lions became my favorite animal after that movie.
I can understand why!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tomorrowland should have been a much better movie then it was.
I was so excited to catch it and then was so disappointed, I agree.
What problems did you have with Tomorrowland?
For me, I really liked the concept of turning what we know of Tomorrowland into a movie, but I thought the delivery of the storyline was a bit too much.
Do you mean the George Clooney relationship with the girl?
I actually liked that aspect eventhough people thought it was somewhat controversial. I thought it was heartwarming that he had a crush on her as a kid, but seeing as she was a robot she wasn't going to age while he would.
I didn't mind it either and I thought the dynamic of their relationship was really interesting. Overall the movie was fun but it lacked more coherence for me.
Britt Robertson was almost like a throw away character in there even though she was the billing lead name.
I know, her character was pretty disappointing. I didn't like the Hugh Laurie stuff either, that was weird.
Brad Bird directed it, director of the Incredibles, and while I think he did a good job directing the movie, the story could have improved it overall so much more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The Aristocats?
I did! It's my favorite cartoon.
I love the personalities of the kittens.
They are really cute, especially the white one.
Oh the white one. That's Marie, right?
Yeah, I think so. She's so funny.
The songs in that movie are so fun.
I always get "Everybody Wants to be a Cat" stuck in my head.
And don't they live in France or something like that?
I think so. The whole atmosphere is so fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Saddest movie of all time?
Old Yeller.
Yeah, why can't they leave the animals alone.
I cried like a baby the first time I saw that.
Me too.
I refuse to show it to my kids.
It's such a classic though.
Perhaps when they're a little older.
My parents showed it to me when I was pretty young.
I'm trying to avoid the trama!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Moana movie yet?
No. How is it?
It was really great. I tought my daughter was going to like it, instead it was was son who loved it.
Wow cool. Then it must not be very girly.
The characteres appeal to everyone. Especially Maui, the main male figure.
I heard something about a stow a way chicken. Is there one?
Yes! Hei hei is his name. Crazy chicken.
Looks like I will have to rent this movie.
Or Just buy it! There are a lot of great songs in the movie too.
Great! More music to get stuck in my head!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Disney's Maleficent?
It was beautifully shot, for one thing.  And you?
It had a lot of high points.
Who knew Maleficent started as a fairy?
I ended up feeling sorry for her.
I guess they borrowed aspects from the Sleeping Beauty film.
Like her appearance.
And the backstory.
I was glad they could provide a happy ending.
Most Disney movies end this way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard you say you are not a big Disney movie fan.
Yeah, I hate to say it. Disney movies are so corny!
Are there any you actually like? I think a lot of them aren't corny.
I do like Lady and the Tramp. The dogs won me over.
That's a good one. I don't know anyone who can resist its charm.
I guess I would also have to say that I liked The Sword and the Stone.
Oh, a classic! Merlin is so funny in that movie.
He cracked me up. It was a wonderful film.
I feel like you can't really say you hate Disney movies if there are some you really like.
Yes, but there are so many that I hate as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
DId you watch Disney's last Herbie movie?
The one with Lindsay Lohan?
Yeah, Herbie Fully Loaded. I watched it recently for the first time and although it wasn't a really good movie overall, I had a lot of fun watching it.
It did a decent job of paying homage to the original Herbie movies. I think some of the modern takes didn't really sit well with modern audiences that wanted more nostalgia from Disney for Herbie.
I thought the special effects they did for Herbie was really cool. I don't know what long time Herbie fans expected.
I can't speak for them but I remember wanting less of the teen drama and more Herbie!
More racing scenes would have been great, but I think they provided enough and the ones they did provide, were excellent!
Did you like Herbie's love interest? That other bug, the modern one.
I thought it was a little corny, but I didn't really mind it. I liked Lindsay in there too.
She did a good job, Michael Keaton was her father remember? Overall it was fun but not one of those legendary memorial Disney films.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you realize the very first Disney animations was probably Bambi?
yeah, it came out in 1942 and was considered to be an animated drama.
I know it's just a cartoon but it's so sad to me. Poor Bambi.
I know, but it's supposed to be kind of like the experiences of life. It's rough but it gets better.
He does make a lot of friends along the way.
Yeah, Thumper, Flower and Faline all become his friends.
I know. It's a good story. There were so many animators that worked on that movie too.
Yeah, that was when there was an art to the animation.
I have noticed in 80's the animation was looking sloppy. You tell it was 2 or more different artists drawing.
I know. Along with Snow White it was the golden age of animation, but the new digital technology is changing things fast...possibly bring us back to that original look and magic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney cartoon musical?
My favorite is Aladdin.
Why Aladdin?
I think Robin Williams did a really good job being the voice of the genie.
He was pretty funny.
I also liked the music.
What was your favorite song?
Friend Like Me. How about you?
I liked A Whole New World.
That's a really pretty song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I think Mulan is my favorite.
Really? I feel like Mulan wasn't that good. I prefer Tarzan.
I had forgotten about Tarzan. That was a really good movie.
Indeed! However, if you count the new Star Wars movies as Disney movies, I would chose those as my favorites.
Of course! Those have to be the best ones. Have you heard about the new episode coming on this year?
Yes! Episode 8 looks promisng.
I feel like I shouldn't have big expectations in case it is not that good.
Don't worry. It will be really good.
We will see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Monster INC was a cool movie.
I know that movie makes all kids fears real
I wonder if they made it to help kids
that is true, maybe make mosnters seem friendly
Boo was so cute with her pigtails
I know, I was worried they would get caught
Mike was funny I liked the way he talked
A place like that with all the doors is so weird
I know I wonder why they came up with that
Yes , I wonder who came up with a monster place with doors and scaring kids
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you seen the new Disney movies?
Only the 2016 ones, I haven't see any 2017 Disney movies.
So, which one did you see?
I saw Zootopia and Moana
I saw those two movies too, they were very popular.
What you think of them?
I only watched Moana for Dwayne Johnson...wasn't as magical as previous Disney movies, but not bad.
What about Zootopia?
Ehh, not as wonderful as I though it would be, but still a good quality movie.
I think there's a little propaganda in there. But that's everything nowadays.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like disney movies?
Definitely!
What is your favorite?
I love finding nemo!
Me too! That is a cute movie.
What is your favorite character from it?
I love Dory.
Same! Did you see Finding Dory?
Not yet!
You should definitely check it out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see "Cars 3"?
I did not, but I see that ticket sales are doing very well.
I remember being very young when the first "Cars" came out.
We both were. I am not sure i can stomach any more of the "Lightning McQueen" character.
Now, I can definitely get excited about the new "Pirates of the Caribbean" Disney movie.
I saw it. It was good if you are loyal to the franchise.
Did all the main characters return to film this one?
Many did and there are a few plot twists.
I want to see the new "Star Wars" movie that will be coming out.
Me too. "Rogue One" was surprisingly good and it helped to put pieces from the old franchise together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
oh yes I did! It was absolutely amazing, and the songs and the special effects were awesome.
Yes, I thought so too! I saw it in the theater when it first came out.
I think I will buy the DVD now that it's out. I really liked the part where Lumiere was singing "Be Our Guest".
Yes! That part of the movie was my absolute favorite also.
Belle's dress was beautiful too. If I ever have a little girl I would totally do a Beauty and the Beast theme nursery.
That would be nice. You could always do a Beauty and the Beast theme wedding?!
Hey good point, I never thought of that. That would make a really nice classy theme, I love everything about that Disney movie.
Okay, well when we meet the man of our dreams, lets have a double wedding. A Beauty and the Beast theme, in front of the Disney Castle.
I'd go for that. Yes I saw they do weddings now in front of the Disney Castle in Florida, and Beauty and the Beast would be a perfect theme!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty & the Beast movie?
No I haven't! It was my favorite growing up. Did you have a favorite Disney movie?
Yes! I can say, without a doubt, that it is Cinderella.
That is my daughters favorite also! I am also a huge fan of Sleeping Beauty.
We love that one around here too!
We have been trying to decide which Classic to pick up next for the kids. Any suggestions?
Maybe Bambi? Or Dumbo? Do they like movies that revolve around animals?
Yes they do! The animals ones are my youngest sons favorite. We have dumbo already and Bambi is definitely going on my list!
I'm glad I could help! Disney movies are my favorite.
Thank you so much! They are my favorite too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Tom Hanks voices Woody in the Disney movie Toy Story.
I did not. Wait I thought Toy Story was a Pixar movie?
It was a joint collaboration between Disney and Pixar.
Well, that is interesting. Are there any other famous actors in Toy Story.
Tim Allen voices Buzzlightyear.
I love Tim Allen, he's so funny.
Also, great bit of trivia here, Joss Whedon and Joel Cohen wrote the screenplay for the first Toy Story.
What Joss Whedon as in the director of Avengers! Wait isn't that also a Disney movie.
Yes it is, maybe they should have an Avengers and Toy Story cross over.
The toys would definitely win that fight, they've got a dinosaur for heaven's sake!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
My favorite Disney movie is 101 dalmatians, the original one.
Who is your favorite character in that movie?
Oddly enough it was Kuala Deville who is yours?
It's so funny she's evil witch.   I thought she was very very scary.  My favorite character was that little dog name patch.
All the Little  dogs were so cute in that movie they did such a good job on that movie.
What's your favorite scene in the movie.
My Favorite scene in the movie was when they were walking up the creek so they didn't leave footprints.   What is your favorite scene.
I really just like when they showed all the dogs on top of the hill at the end.
Oh yes I agree the ending was absolutely perfect!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Disney Movies have you seen recently?
I saw Princess Diaries 2.
Oh isn't Raven in that movie?
Yes she is.
How is she in it?
I think she does a great job but her character is so minor.
Is the Lily character in it?
Yes she is briefly in it for a short period of time.
Do you recommend the movie?
Oh for sure, definitely. It is totally amazing!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like Sleeping Beauty a lot.  Aurora is my favorite heroine of the Disney films.
She's drawn to look so pretty.
Do you like the fairies in the movie?
Yes, I do.  They are very charming.
I like that they are portrayed as older women.
That was something I liked, too.  They seemed like mother figures to Aurora.
Prince Phillip is my favorite prince of the Disney films.  He is so handsome.
I had such a crush on him when I was a kid.
I did, too.  I love that scene where Aurora meets him for the first time in the forest.
That's one of my favorite scenes, too.  I love the song they sing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey I went to see Cars 3 last night.
Really, was it any good?
Brilliant, so funny and cute.
Did it have the same cast as Cars 2?
Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy were the main guys again.
I love Owen Wilson in that role.
You planning on going to see it?
Well I would like to, but I got a lot on at the moment.
The soundtrack is super cool, you can probably find it on YouTube, or at least a trailer for the movie.
Good idea, I'm going to have a look right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My daughter is addicted to Finding Dory. She requests that movie every Friday for movie night.
I agree that it's a great movie. I love Hank. He is so funny!
At least she's gotten over her Frozen phase. I don't have to listen to "Let It Go" a billion times anymore.
I hear you. My daughter is now singing Moana songs instead. I guess it's still a refreshing change.
What's the new Disney animated movie that's coming out this year?
I think it's Coco. It's a Pixar film. I think Cars 3 is coming out this year too.
Man, I can't keep track of them anymore. It's nice that Pixar is doing some original stuff.
Yeah, I was getting a little worried that all they had left were sequels - Cars, Nemo, Monsters Inc.
Those are all great movies for both kids and adults. Some jokes just go right over the kids' heads but the adults laugh.
I think that's what makes those movies so popular. There's something for everyone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Tangled is the best Disney movie ever made.
Why do you think that?
I just love the plot and characters. The songs are pretty great too!
I almost forgot about that movie until you mentioned it.
How could you forget about it? It's so inspirational!
How is it inspirational?
It's about a woman who empowers herself to go explore the world!
I guess it is, but I never thought of it that way before.
You should watch it again.
I might, but I still don't know if I'll like it that much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Disney movies?
When I was a kid, I used to watch a lot of Disney movies.
And now?
Nowadays, I watch their movies sometimes.
Which Disney movie did you like in particular in recent years?
I loved Big Hero 6. It was a very funny and interesting movie. Baymax stole all the limelight.
Yes, I loved it too. They still produce some quality animated movies.
Which one is your favorite in recent years?
I loved Tangled.
Yes, even Tangled was an amazing movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite disney movie?
I really love Mulan.
Oh I love mulan. I love the music as well.
Me too.
Which is your favorite character in Mulan.
Mulan is my favorite because she is so brave and fierce.
That is very true.
I wish they made movies good like that today.
Yeah but there are still great movies nonetheless.
We should watch it together sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the live action of The Jungle Book?
I did. That movie was intense in some scenes but really good.
I found it interesting that they had Kaa as a female in this one verses the cartoon version.
Yes but 	Scarlett Johansson's version made Kaa's voice sound very scary as the snake was trying to eat Mowgli.
I was sad though when Shere Khan killed Akela.
I was too. Shere Khan was definitely fearsome and intimidating compared to the animated version.
King Louie was pretty entertaining.
I liked him a lot but I wasn't expecting him to be so huge.
I also really liked Baloo and Bagheera's banter a lot.
Yeah those two were really great in their performance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new beauty and the beast movie?
Yes, the live action version?
Yep, it was awesome wasn't it?
I loved the girl who played belle, she did a great job!
The beast was a bit odd though wasn't he?
Yes! He kind of creeped me out.
How about Gaston?!
Oh he was dreamy, and The guy who played LeFou was very entertaining!
Did you know that he was the guy who played olaf in frozen?
He did?? I guess I can see that now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes, I went and saw it when it was first released in the theaters. It was one of my favorite Disney movies growing up.
Mine too, I always liked Belle because she was smart and brave. She wasn't the typical damsel in distress.
Belle is a great character. I felt bad for her that she had to constantly reject Gaston and he would never get the hint.
He was an interesting character. What a narcissist! I liked Gaston's sidekick  LeFou too.
I think Emma Thompson did a terrific job as Belle. I didn't know she could sing so well.
I agree. The special effects were fantastic as well. I brought my niece to see the movie and she was nervous that the Best wouldn't find true love in time before the final petal fell from the rose.
That's so cute. Was she happy when Belle and the Beast ended up together at the end?
She was ecstatic and she liked seeing all the Beast's servants turn back into people after being objects for so long.
I love happy endings.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know if they are going to make another Peter Pan movie?
I'm not sure.  They have made so many versions already.
I don't know if all of the versions were Disney though.
It would be cool if they did another version like how Beauty and the Beast used real life actors.
They made Hook a while back.  That had real actors.
Never saw it.  But I don't think Disney made it.
Oh.  If Disney did decide to make a real-life Peter Pan movie, I hope they don't use too many computer graphics.L
Computer graphics for what?
Like to depict Neverland and the mermaids and Tinkerbell.  You know?
Oh right.  Very true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your top three Disney Movies?
Hmm  Three?  Is that all I get?
Yep, just three!
Ok, so I'll go with... Beauty and the Beast, Moana and Lion King
Ooo Oldies mixed with a brand new one!  You didn't like Frozen?
I liked it, but I liked Moana better.  And I've loved Beauty and the Beast and Lion King since I was a kid.
Ok, why do you like them all so much?
Definitely the music!   Circle of life, Tale as old as Time, and You're Welcome.  How can you go wrong with those?!
To true, but what about "Let it Go"??
That's a good one, I just love the others so much more!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the third lion king?
No I did not. Did you?
Yeah I saw it.
How was it?
I do not recommend it at all.
Yeah I figured it would not be that great of a movie.
It is no where near as good as the first.
I will make a note not to see it.
Have you seen the musical of the lion king?
Oh yeah it was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Disney Cars 3 movie that just came out it is really amazingly done?
No not yet but I want to I heard great things about it.
Yes the animation if so realistic it looks like real cars.
Yes I saw the paint jobs on some of the cars from the trailer and they look fantastic rich with detail.
Yes there done very well. The story is great as well & there's is a lot of familiar voice actors in the film.
Disney and Pixar are really doing some amazing work, they keep pushing the boundaries between reality and imagination.
Yeah I know at times in the film until you see the faces on the cars it looks like the real things in action.
Its great I know. With Disney you can never go wrong.
You really need to check it out when you get a chance nothing beats the big screen experience.
Definitely probably this weekend been seeing commercials for it and got great reviews.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Cars movie?
They made a new one?
Yes! Of course they did.
How many is that now?
It is Cars three.
I was not even aware they made a second, why so many.
It is a really successful film series.
I do not see how.
What? Mater was so funny.
They are just cars, there is no story line.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like disney movies?
I love them
Whats one of your favorites?
Hamds down Frozen.
Me too, thats one of the better ones
Yes it is, it has a great story
And great characters.
I love how they show you true love can be family too
Me too, its a great lesson
It was a great overall movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have this theory that kids in America are really defined by which Disney movies come out when they're young enough to like them.
What do you mean?
Well, like, The Lion King came out when I was five, and that was when I liked Disney the most. So I think of it as my favorite.
Hmm. I like One Hundred and One Dalmatians though, but it came out way before I was a kid.
Okay, but what came out when you were five.
Beauty and the Beast.
Okay. Do you like Beauty and the Beast?
I love it!
See what I mean?
I guess you might be right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the movie Mulan?
I think is really great to explore this young woman´s life and way of being.
Do you think that Mulan should had stayed home?
No, I think that as a woman she has rights and is good what she did.
Which is your favorite character other than Mulan.
I would have to say Mushu, he is very funny indeed.
What is your favorite song from the movie?
I would have to say Reflection, it touches your soul.
What is your favorite scene?
When they are dressing her up as a woman, I think the whole scenario is funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you recommend a good Disney movie for me?
Yes, Peter Pan.
I've never seen that one.
It is pretty old, but it is an iconic Disney movie.
What happens in it?
Peter takes Wendy and her family to Neverland.
What happens there?
Peter fights the wicked Captain Hook.
Oh, that sounds awesome.
Yeah, and there is an alligator that lives in the water. He is scary.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The new Descendants movie is coming out soon.
I heard. We liked the first one.
Not sure where they will go with this one.
Maybe there will be more focus on the Island of the Lost?
True, that was not the focus of the first movie.
I felt like it was really popular at my house but overall I am not sure how many people got into it.
Well, I know we will have to go and see it!
Us too.
I hope the music is just as good as it was in the first one.
Rotten to the Core was a great song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Up came out eight year ago?
Really, man time goes by quick.
Yeah, I watched the opening scene again yesterday and it still makes me cry.
Oh man don't remind me. I can't believe Ellie died that was too much.
Yeah I felt way too many feelings. Thought it was just going to be a fun adventure movie.
Boy, you were wrong. Although the rest of the film is really funny.
It's also so cute.
Yeah I love the dog. What's he called.
Dug.
Or is it Doug?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen frozen?
Yes, I love it.
Me too, what is your favorite song.
Do you want to build a snowman? Is my favorite
Yeah that one is cute, but my favorite is Let it Go.
That one is really good.
Which sister is your favorite
I love Anna, she is so approachable.
Well especially compared to her icy sister.
This is true, although later Elsa warms up, and I love how sisterly love prevailed in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I've only just found out that there were Pongo and Perdy only had like 20 dalmations in "101 Dalmations".
Yeah, so what?
Well, firstly why's it called "101 Dalmations" and secondly how is Cruella de Vil supposed to make a coat out of them.
Firstly, they meet 80 more Dalmations when Cruella kidnaps them hence the coat.
Oh, that makes sense.
Wait have you not seen it?
No, never got round to it.
Really, you're missing out on one of the all-time classics.
OK, well should we watch it this weekend.
Sorry no can do, making a Dalmation-skinned coat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
so what did you do last night?
Oh I just stayed in bed and watched Aladdin.
I love Aladdin! I haven't seen it in years.
Yea it had been a little while for me too. It still holds up.
Oh I'm sure. I remember I used to be able to quote all of the Genies lines.
Oh yea I can imagine. There's so many good ones.
I loved his cheerleader bit. "If he can't do it, Great!"
I laughed really hard at that last night. I forgot how much I loved that bit.
Yea, you know I'm going to have "A whole new world" stuck in my head all day.
Oh I'm right there with you. Its been in my head for the last four hours.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what's a good movie?  Lady and the Tramp.
Oh yeah!
I hope they don't remake it anytime soon.  Leave it how it was.
Seems like it would be hard to remake that into a live-action version.
It would be all CGI.
There's been enough talking dog movies.
Up had a talking dog.
Yeah, but that was animated.  This would be total-CGI.
Some things are better left never remade and that's one of them.
Agree 100% with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What movie do you wish they'd remake?
Robin Hood would be a good candidate.
I agree with you, but only kind of.
Don't get me wrong, the original musical stands out on its own.
It has a great hand-drawn quality to it.  It fits a movie that was made in the 70's in tone and substance.
It also had some great musical numbers that fit into that time period.
I recognize the guy who voiced the bear voicing the other bear in The Jungle Book.
Yeah, that's kind of a nice, interesting trivia question.
What was his name?
Phil Harris.  Aren't you impressed with my vast knowledge?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dad, what is your favorite Disney movie ever made?
I would have to say Aladdin.
Why Aladdin?
Well the way the movie was animated and made it had very good graphics.
I agree with you there, the graphics were awesome.
Plus, I love the genie in the bottle.
Oh that was my favorite character to.
What was your favorite scene with him?
It was when the genie helped Aladdin conquer Jaffar and save the castle.
My favorite part is when he was first introduced, he appeared scary but was a friendly person.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Cuba Gooding Jr. was great in the movie Snow Dogs.
I liked that movie.
Imagine being exchanged as a baby for dogs.
Those dogs were cute in that movie.
Beautiful.
I wouldn't want to live there though.
No, me either.
It must be a thrill though being pulled by a dog sled.
Yes, but in a warmer climate.
Fnny, but I don't think it works that way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Pinocchio for sure.
Why, what was so great about that movie?
Are you kidding me? It was a classic that demonstrated the struggles of a growing boy turning into an adolescent.
I heard the original was a lot darker.
Me too, I know Pinocchio kills Jepetto in the original story.
Yea but this is a Disney movie, they couldn't do that.
No way! Imagine the backlash, they are known for having happy endings.
I think that's why people watch Disney movies, to feel better about their lives.
I just find enjoyment in them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't tell you how many times I've seen 101 Dalmations.
Oh my gosh, Cruella de Vil was so scary to me! Especially in that scene where she's driving her car like a madwoman and her eyes get all wild and red.
I can see how that would have been scary for you, but all the puppies were so cute!
Okay I'll grant you that, the puppies were adorable.
One of my favorite scenes is when Perdy goes into labor and Pongo and Roger are out waiting and he just keeps getting more and more excited as more puppies are born.
Yeah, he was a pretty proud puppy Dad.
I mean, if you had 101 kids wouldn't you be pretty proud?
I think I'd be more worried in how I was going to feed all those kids actually.
That's a good point. Can you imagine how much Roger and Anita must have spent in dog food?
I'd think they'd have to get second jobs just for that purpose!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what are we watching tonight?
I thought we'd watch Beauty and the Beast.
The cartoon? Why?
Well, I've actually never seen it.
Are you serious??
Yep, never seen it. I thought we could watch it before we watch the one with Emma Watson
Sure thing!
You sure you don't mind?
Oh not at all.
Awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the movie Frozen that came out few years ago
yea, it feels like almost yesterday, cause that was such a guilty movie
why is that?
I think it has something to do with the main theme music, let it go
haha, it's so addictive right? I can't stop humming it after seeing the movie
exactly, and we are all adults now, so that automatically makes you feel guilty
but kids really love them, Disney really has the magic of making great animations
that I can't deny, can't wait to see the next Disney animation
me too
I heard there is a new one coming out in July
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch Disney movies when you were growing up?
Just a few. Not all of them.
Which ones have you seen?
I've seen 101 Dalmatians, Bambi, and the Lion King. Toy Story is my favorite.
Do you like the Disney/Pixar movies better than the Disney classics?
Probably. I think they are more modern.
So you don't like the Disney movies that retell old fairy tales?
No, not really.
That's crazy. I like them all. I can't think of one Disney movie I don't like.
Well, I can think of a lot!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Cars three is here, are you going?
I wouldn't miss it, I loved the last movies.
Who are you taking?
I will grab a kid, or even my teenager. He used to love the Cars movies.
What is his favorite character?
There are so many great characters it's hard to choose.
I think I like Mater the best, he is always so lovable.
yeah, he is always getting himself into predicaments.
Lighting McQueen saves the day for him a lot.
Yes, he does, but isn't that what friends are for?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
The Little Mermaid.
I love that one, what is your favorite song from the soundtrack?
Part of that World is best to sing, Under the sea for dancing.
I love the tropical feel of that one.
Yes, all of Sebastian's bits are gold.
Who is your favorite Disney princess?
Ariel, of course
I thought so but had to ask.
I also like Cinderella.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana?
Yes, Moana is my son's favorite movie!
I thought it was fun to watch with my son.
My son loves the songs in the movie.
I found myself singing along, too!
Do you think that Disney will make a Moana 2?
As successful as the first Moana was, I would not be surprised.
My son certainly would watch it. He has seen the first Moana at least 20 times.
He hasn't gotten tired of it yet?
No, not even close! He loves the movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember watching Lilo & Stitch as a kid?
Yes! It made me want to go to Hawaii!
It made me want to have a cute pet alien.
Stitch was so destructive, though!
I know, but it would be worth it for how cute he was.
I'm not sure about that... Maybe I'd like to have him around once he's settled down a lot.
I liked how Lilo fed that fish a sandwich all the time.
And she couldn't feed him a tuna sandwich!
Of course, it did make her late to her dance class.
I think she ended up better once she got her destructive alien friend after all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really miss John Candy.
Me too.
Which of his films did you like most?
Cool Runnings.
I totally forgot about that movie.
Although, seemed a little large to be in a bobsled.
Well he could have gained weight.
Obviously, but he was a pretty statuesque guy anyway.
You have to suspend disbelife.
I know. I know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to watching Spider-Man: Homecoming?
Absolutely! I really like the addition of spider-man to the marvel universe!
Right?! I can't wait to see Spidey fighting side-by-side with Iron-Man!
There could not have been a better choice for Iron-Man than Robert Downey Jr.
I'm very curious as to how Spider-man will influence the rest of the Marvel movies.
Not to mention the roster of exciting villains that Spider-man will also add.
Speaking of Villains who is the main villain this time?
The Vulture! He is a lesser known villain,but I'm sure Michael Keaton will make the character shine.
Sounds so exciting! Did you get your tickets already?
Tickets and some souvenirs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney film?
Mary Poppins for sure.
That was a good one.
I heard they're going to do a remake.
Oh, yeah? I wonder who they'll get to play Bert.
They certainly can't top Dick VanDyke.
That's for sure.
Or Julie Andrews for that matter.
Everyone in the original was great.
I hope they don't foul it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Aladdin?
Yes and I absolutely love that movie.
My kids just say it the other day and have been singing the songs ever since.
I does have a lot of great songs in it.
Jasmine and Aladdin were great in it, but I think the Genie stole the show.
I'd have to agree with you.
Robin Williams did such an awesome job in that part.
I know! I don't think anyone else could have pulled it off like he did.
I never saw the sequel, Return of Jafar, but I can't imagine it being that good.
I didn't see it either. I didn't really want to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really want to watch Wall-E again.
Why?
I remember that it had a big emotional impact on me, but I don't remember too much of the plot.
I love Wall-E--it had two settings.
The "dump" where Wall-E lived was one, right?
Yep--the other was a spaceship full of humans.
Oh yeah! The people couldn't move on their own--let's hope that's not prophetic!
I know, right?
I also remeber there was a romance...
Yeah, with Eva! How could you forget her?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Brave was a good movie.
I liked that the main character was strong.
It had some scary parts with the bear that scared my kids.
Oh really? I guess that could be scary for kids.
It had some funny parts also like the boys.
Yes, her brothers were funny. They were adorable also with their red hair.
It was funny when they turned into bears.
The relationship of Merida with her mom was really believable.
Yes how many mother daughter relationships are similar to that one.
Many of them. Many daughters think their mothers are too bossy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was on the bus early and the guy next to me was singing "Deception, Disgrace" from Lion King 2.
The one about Scar's son? What was he called again?
Kovu, I think.
Yeah that's the one. Such a good tune.
Indeed. It's one of the few sequels to be as good as the original.
I think it's actually better.
For real.
Yeah for a start there's no Timon and Pumba.
What? They're such key parts of the film. Without them there'd be no Hakuna Matata.
What does "Hakuna Matata" even me?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can Disney make one movie that isn't awesome?
I know! I feel like everything they make is good.
I used to think they could not replicate their old films, but then Frozen came out.
I know. The Little Mermaid was my favorite.
Those old movies were great! They defined my childhood!
Me too - now I am still watching the new ones because they are so good!
Agreed - our kinds have it really good with the new Disney films.
I wonder if they would make a more mature film.
They could, but no need with the success they have in the children's genre.
I can't wait to see what they come up with next!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Frozen was such a good movie, it became really popular
I liked Olaf the most, he was so cute
He was cute, I liked the cute little song he sang
I liked Elsa also, she was fun
I liked the part where they sang the song "Do you want to build a snowman?"
That part was good, I also liked it
It was sad that their parents both died though
I know and it was sad when Elsea's hair was cute
I know then she lost her power
I am glad things worked out for them I am looking forward to the next Frozen movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the movie Snow White.
Me too, aren't the dwarfs adorable?
yes they are, my favorite is Doc.
I really like Grumpy.
And the old witch with the apple is great!
Yes she is. Take a bite of my apple dearie!
Snow White was so pretty even though she is animated!
Yes, and the house they all lived in was so cute
Yes. The music was great as well.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if Brave is getting a sequel?
I don't know it has been a while.
Yea, 5 years, can you believe it?
Not at all, man.
Yea, but I do hope it gets a sequel.
What's left to say?
I would love to see Merida as Queen!
That would be awesome.
All the elegance of her mother, Elinor but the toughness of her father, Fergus.
Agreed, but you know, Elinor was pretty tough herself, taking on Mordu...
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what I always thought was a really cool movie?
No what was that?
The Sword in the Stone. The Disney movie, do you remember it?
Yes I remember it. It's Arthur when he was a kid.
Yes and he befriends Merlin. Who comes off as a strange magician really.
In his weird way Merlin taught Arthur a lot of important life lessons that he used one he became king.
That's true. Hey do you remember the scene where Merlin fought with that other witch, Madam Mim?
Yeah, do you remember how he defeated her by turning into a bacteria?
Yes! Another lesson for Arthur! Brain over brawn.
Merlin had to think his way out of the situation while Mim just tried to use her strength!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Frozen is a really good disney movie.
It sure is.
My kids have watched it over and over again.
Mine too.
I am actually getting a little tired of it.
Yes and all they talk about and want are Anna and Elsa toys.
Yes I know. Disney makes a fortune off their movies.
They do.
My other favorites are Cinderella and Snow White.
Yes they are timeless classics!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What cartoon should I take my nephew to?
Cars 3!
Oh, is that out?
Yeah, it just came out last weekend. It's really fun!
I think he was too young for the first one, so I don't know if he knows about it.
He doesn't have to have seen the first one. He will love it!
He does like race cars a lot.
The music is fun and the voices are good, too.
Ok, this sounds like a hit!
Let me know how he likes it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what new Disney movies are coming out?
Um, I can't remember. I remember Frozen was an OK one, but I was never a big fan of singing in movies.
Hmm, that's probably why we haven't ever talked about Disney movies before.
Oh, there's The Good Dinosaur! That one got good reviews. Is there singing, though?
If there's only one song, would you still see it? We could go see it this weekend!
I guess I could suffer through it, just because you're my friend!
What do you want to see if that one is sold out? My only rule is that it has to be a Disney movie.
What about Zootopia? I'm up for animated animals in a big city any day!
I think that one is a couple of months old. What about Finding Dory?
Yes! I loved Finding Nemo, I think I'd love Finding Dory too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Zootopia?
Yes. I thought it was very cute.
Is it a newer movie?
Yes. it came out a recently.
What did you like about it?
The plot and the characters
Was there a fox in it?
Yes. He was one of the main characters
Cool
I love that movie a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie Bolt?
Yes, it's one of my favourites!
The storyline is so different, with Bolt thinking he's a super hero.
He gets a reality check though!
I know. I really like Mittens also.
I felt sorry for her since her family left her behind and she had to learn to fend for herself.
The character of Rhino was funny too.
He certainly had a case of hero worship for Bolt.
Did you know that Miley Cyrus and John Travolta sang the theme song?
Yes, I saw the video.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the live action Cinderella?
It was just ok.  The dress was nice.
I love the cartoon!
Oh, it's my favorite! Sing sweeet nightingale, sing sweet night -in - gale!!
It is my favorite version of Cinderella.
At least the new one had magic.
Unlike Ever After.
But, I still like the birds and the friendly mice in the cartoon.
I do too.  And the pumpkin tranformation.
Oh, the best!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's the best Disney princess?
The best, or my favorite?
Isn't that the same thing?
No way. The best is Mulan, objectively. She saves China!
But she's not your favorite?
No, my favorite is Elsa.
Seriously?
I just love Let It Go so much!
That's such a silly reason to pick her.
Hey, you asked!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey , do you like Disney movies?
Yeah, of course , I have been watching them since I was a kid. I still do.
So , who is your favorite Disney Princess?
Easy , That would be Jasmine
Jasmine ? Why so ?
Let's see , She is beautiful , smart and adventurous, a princess who doesn't need saving.
I agree , she got the goods . What's the best thing about her though?
She has a kickass tiger for her pet!
Oh! I totally forgot about it , that is pretty rad!
I know right! A freaking tiger as a pet , I don't know anyone who wouldn't be impressed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the name of the stepsisters in the movie Cinderella?
Not sure, I think Drusilda and Esmerelda.
They sure were ugly.
And mean too.
The stepmother was cruel.
I am glad Cinderella got to go to the ball.
Me too. And lost her shoe.
Yea, without that the prince would not have found her.
That is true. And then the got married.
And lived happily ever after.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Disney did a version of Peter Pan too, right?
Yeah, that was a good one.
Agreed. Though being a kid forever doesn't sound as good as it once did.
No, the immortality thing is maybe a bit frightening. That's why Wendy ultimately has to return home.
Maybe Peter should have taken a page from her book.
Yeah maybe. But I think his role was to be a foil for Hook.
Someone had to keep him in check.
Right, and that wasn't going to be Smee! Or the Lost Boys for that matter.
You'd think that Tinkerbell could hold her own - fairy dust and all.
I'm still very unclear on what fairies can and can't do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Lady and the Tramp good?
Yes, it is very good.
Did you like the dogs?
Yes, they were cute and funny
Were there cats in it?Yes. Siamese cats.
What is the main character's name?
Lady
Oh yeah. I have not seen it in a long time.
It's one of the best classic Disney films.
I wanna buy it on Blu Ray
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched The Little Mermaid?
No. I told you I haven't seen many Disney movies.
You're so uncivilised!
Yeah, my mom didn't let me watch a lot of Disney movies growing up.
How come?
She was against the magic in them she said.
Aw, that's too bad. I think there are plenty of Disney movies that don't have magic in them though.
Like which ones?
A lot of the older ones I think. There were some ones about famour historical figures, and wasn't there one about some animals trying to find their way home?
That sounds familiar!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana yet?
No, what is it about?
What? Its about a hawaiian princess!
Does she have a prince.
No she really doesn't, but there is a demi-god she searches after named Maui.
Does she find him?
Yes she does, he seems very arrogant when she meets him!
What a jerk!
Yes, but he eventually seems to learn some compassion.
Thats good, sounds like a great movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was the movie "Tangled" about Rapunzel?
Well, yes and no.  It was a loose interpretation of it.
Right because her hair was special, and very long.
Just like Rapunzel.
And who played the voice of Rapunzel.
Mandy Moore.
Ah yes.  She did a good job.
Yes she sings in the movie too.
Oh really?  On the soundtrack?
Yes she sang "I See the Light".  It was nominated for an Oscar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved watching Bambi as a child.
Yes, it was a fun and cute movie.
Which was your favorite character in the movie?
As much as I liked Bambi, Thumper impressed me much.
Do you know Donny Dunagan did the voice over for young Bambi?
Are you a fan of Donny?
I just love his voice as young Bambi.
I liked the voice of Bambi in all its phases, be it a baby, young or youngish adult Bambi.
How did you like Faline?
She seemed bit shy but cute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Disney movie princess has the prettiest dress?
I liked Rapunzel from the movie Tangled.
Are you sure that's a Disney movie.
Yes, it is - I liked her purple dress.
Ok, yeah you're right.  I think my favorite is Belle's yellow dress.
I wore that for Halloween once, it was really pretty.
Merida's dress from Brave looked cool.
Yeah, but I think it would be really hot to wear, it had a lot of layers.
Then you could wear Ariel's dress, since the top is only a bikini.
Yeah, she did get a different dress to wear on land though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know movie Lady and the Tramp?
Oh yes! It was one of my favorites growing up.
I had a mutt that looked like Tramp when I was a kid. We called him Scoundrel, almost the same meaning.
I liked Lady because of her curly haired ears and big eyes. I think she was based off of some kind of spaniel.
Do you remember the cats in that movie?
Si and Am? They were siamese... if you please! That song was awesome!
They were horribly sneaky weren't they?
Aren't most cats?
Yes but these two gave new meaning to sneaky.
I don't think they ever got the deserved recognition as a Disney villain that they deserved.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My kids broke their Frozen DVD today.
Oh no!
Yeah, it created a mini-meltdown in the house.  My daughter was in tears.
What are you going to do about it.
We bought the DVD/Bluray combo so we have a backup.
Crisis averted.
Problem is it's really scratched up.  Any ideas?
You should clean it with a wet towel to see if that helps.
You don't think it will make it worse, do you?
No worse than Elsa freezing it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was thinking I should give Frozen another chance.
You didn't like it?
I just couldn't really focus. I was on a plane and the kid behind me kept kicking my chair.
That sounds really unpleasant!
It was! And now I can only remember the songs, really.
Well, the songs were the important part.
Yeah, but I always like the story of Disney movies.
I can understand that.
Want to watch it together?
Sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Maleficent? With Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning?
I haven't, how was it?
It was a great movie, awesome graphics. Scary at times, but good.
The classic Sleeping Beauty I love.
That is a great film. It came out in 1959!
Wow, I didn't realize it was that old. I love the song, "Once Upon a Dream"
Great song. I love Aurora, she's such a sweet character. Mary Costa did the voice for her.
I didn't know that. Who voiced Maleficent?
Eleanor Audley. She made a great Maleficent. So dark and scary.
I like the eery music when Aurora is being drawn to the spinning wheel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen the new Cars 3 movie?
I have , I hated that he crashed though.
I know. but he did get a nice new paint job in the end !
His coach really did help him though.
she did, it was due time for him to retire though I think.
Mater is my favorite character in this movie.
I know, he has bog teeth , I wonder why they made his teeth so bog
lol I know that is so funny, he is so rusty
I wish I had a friend like Mater and McQueen!
haha I wish I had a car like Mcqueen as well!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Disney movie from the last couple of years?
I like a lot of them. Maybe, I would go with The Finest Hours.
That was a Disney movie?
Yes, it was. It wasn't animated, but it was Disney all the same.
Why did you like it?
I liked it because it showed a man who cared about rescuing these other men that were stuck out on a sinking ship in the middle of a storm.
Does it have a happy ending?
Yes it actually does. It's based on a true story also.
I do like to see movies that are based on a true story.
Yeah, it makes it seem more real because you know this sort of thing really happened and isn't just totally made up for dramatics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Sky High?
Yeah that was almost foreshadowing by Disney
What do you mean?
Well they are behind the Marvel franchises right now
Oh so you think the movie was about high school kids learning how to be super heroes?
Yeah it almost like it imitated life.
I think thats a great connection.
I thought the movie was a little light
I liked Kurt Russell in it
Yeah he always does a good job for the studio.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the new Cars movie?
Oh yeah. What number is this one?
It's the third one in the series.
Oh, that's right. Yeah, I loved the other two.
Who was your favorite character?
Definetly Mater.
Who was he played by?
Larry the Cable guy. He is so funny.
I know, that whole cast is full of funny people.
Oh I agree, Owen Wilson is one of my favorite actors and comedians.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you seen any good Disney movies lately?
Naw.  I'm not a fan of cartoon movies.
You mean animated movies.  They are a lot better then cartoons.  I love em.
Well, all the same I prefer real people to animation that's all.
All right.  You know Disney doesn't just do animation though.
Good point.  I really like the Chronicles of Naria series.
Excellent fantasy series, agreed.  How about serious movies like Remember the Titans.
Great movie. Or I guess, some of those old comedy's like Parent trap.
They actually did a remake of that not too long ago.
That was back in the late 90's with Lindsay Lohan.  I remember that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the most memorable Disney musical?
The one I remember most of the songs from is Mary Poppins.
Did you listen to those songs when you were a kid?
Yeah, I sang those song too quite a bit. It's very memorable for me.
Did Mary Poppins have a lot of songs?
Yeah, I remember Supercalifragilistic...You know what I mean.
I know, that's a lot to say. I actually remember Let's Go Fly a Kite and Just a Spoonful of Sugar.
See? There are a lot of memorable songs, aren't there?
Yeah, and Feed the Birds with the old lady in the park.
Yeah, I know there's a lot more songs I can't remember off the top of my head too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What year did Bambi come out?
I think it was around 1940.
Really? That long ago?
Yes, it was the second Disney movie after Snow White.
Wow, I didn't realize it was that long ago.
Yes, it still holds up though.
Yes, good characters.
I liked Thumper the rabbit.
Yes, he was a fun character
Especially when he would thump his foot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Donald is Funny
Donald Who?
Donald Duck
I like him
He is just hilarious in the cartoons
I think goofy is better though
No way not at all
Why not
Because he lacks the nuances of the duck
How though
XXXXXXXXXXX
You think Disney see girls, women or princesses as second rate citzens?
No, Disney is actually quite diverse with leading cartoon women.
How so and what Disney princesses do you mean?
There was Pocahantas who was a princess and Native American as well.
That's true but can you think of any other Disney princesses that shows their diversity?
Milan, she was the Asian princess right?
I didn't see that Disney movie. Who else you got?
Disney's first Black princess was named Tiana and played by Anika Rose.
I guess Disney movies have come a long way from their early stereotypical Jungle Book days.
Have you see the Disney movie that shows their first gay kiss?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Bambi was the saddest Disney movie ever.
Saddest?  I don't know about that.
What movie was sadder than that?
I thought Up was pretty sad.
The difference there is Bambi's mom was murdered.  In Up, she just of being old.
That doesn't decrease the heartache.
I'm just saying, one is unexpected, the other is not necessarily so.
Both deaths were not expected.
Well, you have your opinion and I have mine.
I guess so.  Mine is the right one by the way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of that actor in the pirate movie we saw?
Which pirate movie? The one we saw at the theatre or at home?
The one that has a Disney ride named after it and the actor was surprising guests on the ride?
Oh Pirates of the Caribbean.
Yea that one! What is the main pirates name?
Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp
Yes, Johnny Depp! He was good in that Disney picture and has managed to make a long successful career with that role.
He sure does a good job. He says he emulated his character after some rockstar musician.
Really? Who behaves like that in real life?
Keith Richards.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Disney princess?
Hmm...that's a tough one.  I like a lot of them.
But if you had to pick a favorite?  Who would it be?
I guess Jasmine.
Why Jasmine?
I don't know.  She's different from the other princesses.  She's more exotic.
Yeah, she's pretty.  Aladdin is a good movie.
I agree.  I like the magic carpet.
The carpet is cool, but I loved the genie.  Robin Williams did his voice.
That's right!  The genie was awesome!  So funny!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new beauty and the beast?
I have, I loved it. Have you?
I started watching online. I did not like it much and stopped it part way in.
Really what did you not like?
It was almost the same in some ways as the animated but then not. I thought emma watson's voice was weak.
I had heard some critiques of using a non singer such as Emma. But I enjoyed it.
Maybe I will give it another try.. don't know why I disliked it so much.
Did you like the animated version?
Yes, I loved it when I was younger.
Maybe that is partly why you did not care for the real life version. I sometimes find it hard to enjoy remakes of favorite films of mine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite recent disney movie?
For animated recent I would say zootopia.
I forgot they did that. the sloth character is so funny.
Ya he is, so true of  government workers... slow.
I liked frozen more though.
I think most people preferred Frozen.
Ya, it may have been disney most popular movie in a long time.
Well what about the Star wars films?
I mean animated film.
Fair enough, I think you may be right. It was crazy popular.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When is Disney going to release "Song of the South"?
You mean on DVD? I don't know - it might make people angry.
How can it make you angry? It is such a beautiful film.
Don't get me wrong - I'm a fan. But it comes off as pretty racist.
Disney has released other movies that can come off as racist as well. Just look at Peter Pan.
I guess in their mind acceptability of racism depends on race.
I am partly a fan of the movie because Splash Mountain is my favorite ride.
I would bet there are people out there riding that ride who don't even know it's based on a movie.
I think you are right. In fact, I think most people don't know.
That's sad to me. "Zipadeedoodah" is so much fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like animals and Disney movies?
I don't, but my children do.
Have they seen Bambi?
Yes, my daughter especially loves that film.
It is my daughters favorite movie too!
I think next time our daughters have a play date, Bambi is to film to play!
Do you have a Blue Ray player?
No, unfortunately not.
I will bring my Blue Ray player with a copy of Bambi on Blue Ray next time our children get together.
Thank you so much, they would really love that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that trailer for the upcoming Disney movie Coco?
I think so. Is that the Mexican one?
Yes! I think that's a new category for Disney.
I'm glad to see Disney making more diverse films.
Yeah, even if I don't understand everything about the Mexican culture, I find it interesting to watch.
So do I. It's always interesting to get a different perspective on things.
Do you know who the actors will be?
You mean the voice actors?
Of course, I know it's an animated film!
I don't remember most of the names, but I know Benjamin Bratt is one of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like that new Hawaiian movie
Which one
The one made by disney
Oh that one is cute
I like the CG
it fits well
They always do good CG though
Nah
Why
Toy story 1 was bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
What was the last disney movie that you saw?
I saw the aristocats recently.
Where did you see that?
We have the vhs of it.
You watched it on vhs?
Yeah sure did.
Man I haven't watched anything on vhs in years.
We still watch ours all the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you think of that Disney movie snow white?
I loved snow white, everything from the songs to the animation.
Hey do you remember Elsa from Frozen, do you think she was evil with her ice powers?
Not at all she just simply did not under stand how to control it.
That song Let it Go from Frozen its really catchy isn't it.
Yea I found it catchy but it gets stuck in my head so I hate it now.
Did you find the Lion King to be a sad movie ?
overall I did not find it sad but that part where Simba's dad died made me cry.
Do you like happy endings such as Beauty and the Beast?
Yup I really do love the warm feelings of a happy ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like movies?
Yes
What about disney movies
Love them
Me too
I made the mistake of buying frozen though
Why was it a mistske?
My kods have watched it so many times
That makes sense
I know the whole thing by heart
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Fantasia on Netfix last night.
I remember that my Aunt Catherine took me to that when I was around 4 years old.
Did you like it?
I remember being really afraid when the brooms came to life and were putting buckets of water all over the place.
That scared you?
Hey, I was a little kid. Yes it scared me.
Did you tell your Auntie you were scared?
No, I didn't want her to feel bad for taking me to the movie.
That was nice of you.
She recently died so I now look back at it as a good experience because she and I were together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is one of your favorite Disney movies?
I love The Lion King.
Me too! What's your favorite part?
When one of the Hyena's says Mufasa and the other hyena starts cracking up laughing.
Oh I love that part!
I also love when Timon and Pumbaa do the distraction with the song and dance. So funny!
I love Pumbaa. That's my favorite character.
My favorite character is Rafiki.
The Lion King is defenitly one of my favorites.
I agree!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the first Avengers movie?
I thought it was awesome!
Yea it was probably my favorite Marvel movie thus far.
Yea, same here. Who was your favorite character in the movie?
I really liked Spiderman.
Yes! Tom Holland is such a good fit for that role.
I can't wait for his standalone Spiderman movie to come out.
It's next up on their release list, so it won't be too much longer of a wait.
Do you want to go see it together when it comes out?
Sure, that sounds great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what did you think of Frozen?
Oh, I liked it, especially from an artistic point of  view
What do you mean?
Well, I'm a bit of  CG buff myself, so I thought all the effects and animations was terrific!
Hey, neat fact, did you know in the original script Elsa was supposed to be the villain?
Yeah, I heard that.  I think it was because it was originally based on The Snow Queen story for Hans Christian Andersen, and the Queen's the villain in that one as well.
Now, as much as I liked the film there were a few things I would have changed.
Like what?
Well, I thought the Trolls were pretty pointless... they could replaced them with the characters getting info from a magic book and nothing would be different.
Ahhh.. but they were so funny!  "I grew a mushroom!"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh my gosh, I just saw the Disney movie Moana!
What did you think? Wasn't it great?
Yeah, I loved the intense scenes and colors.
Totally, I really liked that it was a female-led culture.
That's true. It's nice to see Disney moving away from girls being "little princesses" who need help from "big princes"
I completely agree. It used to be that Disney was all about the princesses who needed saving.
Yeah, now it seems that, especially with Moana and other movies that have come out recently the girls are in charge of themselves
I think it's important for the little girls to see strong female leads in Disney movies
I totally agree. And the songs in Moana were amazing!
Yeah they were! It was definitely a movie I, and my kids enjoyed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the movie 'Pocahontas' from the 1990's?
I enjoyed it when it came out.
I just saw it, and I was a little disappointed.
Why, what was the disappointment for you?
Well I thought that it was disrespectful to Native Americans.
Oh, I didn't catch that when I was a child watching it.
Plus it got a lot of the history and facts wrong from that colonization period.
Well that's to be expected of a kid's movie.
I guess you're right, because they don't want to be too gritty or realistic for the kid's sake.
Yes, they need to keep a softer tone for the young ones until they can understand the complexities of history.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Dumbo?
Yes, many years ago
Did you like it?
Yes, I remember watching it a bunch as a kid.
I loved the theme of a magic feather and flying.
Oh right, the feather from the crows.
Yes, but it really was a farce
And Dumbo figure it's out in the end.
Yes, and he shows those clowns who's boss
Yes, with peanuts and all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved the new Beauty and The Beast movie. Have you seen it?
Eww, absolutley not. Nothing could be better than the original. And tell me how will the clock and candle holder be real?
They get it done, i promise. Emma Watson is a perfect Belle.
I wish they would make a remake of Lion King, and not in the musical way. But a real actor play.
I dont know if i could take that in real life. I love the cartoon movie, and a dead Simba's dad would make me cry. I am a softie.
Haha, it would be fake though. I would love to see someone play Timon and Pumba. "Akauna Matata"
"It means no worries for the rest of your days!" That was one of the best parts of the whole movie.
That, and when Rakifi holds up baby Simba and it goes, aaaaaayaaaananenenenenam
Nice spelling singing there. I guess a new Nala and Simba could come to town and I would go watch it.
I would be the first one there, hoping JTT still plays Simba. Nineties crush forever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Greatest  Disney movie of all time for me would be Cinderella! What would be your favorite?
I would have to say my favorite Disney movie of all is The Lion King, the story line itself was classic . Broke my heart when Simba lost his father.
Yeah Lion King was great Disney  classic, It's rated the seventh- highest-grossing animated film of all time.
If I am not mistaken Cinderella was acknowledged as the 9th greatest  film in the animation genre.
Disney has managed to evolve very well, even their new Movies in 2017 are spectacular, like Moana .
Moana is so cute and a great story line , I mean a dangerous teen out to sea exploring, all but to save her people!
Yes I surely agree flawless, what about her dad trying to teach her about her duties as this young queen, but withhold  her family secret.
Wondrous ending with her newly found friend and side kick Maui (Dwayne Johnson).
We can Agree Disney corporation  has made some really good movies, and turned into classics through out time.
Definitely agreed !
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know it is not a big one, but I always loved Oliver and Company.
The one with Billie Joel as the dog?
Yep, that's the one.  It's based on the show Oliver and has all these cute animals.
Yeah, I know there was the chihuahua, and the little cat is Oliver.
Fagan is in it too, as the leader of the gang.
It sounds just like the original Oliver, then
The music is so good in the movie too.
I would hope so, with Billie Joel involved.
I wonder why the movie was not as successful as some of the others.
Well like you, I am sure there are many die hard fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really liked the movie Moana.
I saw that one. Dwayne Johnson does the voice of Maui.
Yeah, he is a pretty entertaining character.
I liked the song he sings called, "Your Welcome"
That is a really good song. I like Moana's song though called How Far I'll Go.
I love that song. I also liked Moana's Grandmother in the movie.
Yeah her grandmother was very endearing and funny.
It's sad though in some parts involving her grandma.
Some people don't like Moana much but others do.
It does seem to be one of Disney's more popular films lately.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've never gotten around to seeing Zootopia. You've seen it before, right?
Oh, yes. That is one of my favorite movies.
I guess I better go see it soon.
You definitely should, especially because I heard a sequel is in the works.
Really? It seems like the first one just came out.
I know, but it really was a great movie. The voice acting by Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin was great.
I didn't know that they were in the movie.
Oh, yeah. They play the main characters Nick and Judy.
Cool. Is there anyone else I should listen for when I get around to watching it?
Well, you probably weren't expecting this, but Shakira's in the movie too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Aladdin, you?
Mine too! What was your favorite part?
When they take the magic carpet ride.
yea that was awesome, it had some great voice actors too.
It sure did, Robin Williams was my favorite.
I agree, but it Gilber Godfrey as Iago comes as a close second.
What an annoying voice, he was perfect for that role.
Yea, and so was Robin Williams as the genie.
He really sold that role.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Star Wars is now owned by Disney, right?
Yeah, Disney bought it from George Lucas I think two or three years ago now.
But are they really "Disney" movies? I mean, there's no songs or anything...
Well, there is the cantina scene in the new one. Not like the original, but still cantina-like.
You're being difficult. You know what I mean. Singing.
Sorry, I know what you mean. Yeah, I guess they are different in that way. But Disney also did live action movies without songs in the past.
Yeah, like The Black Hole, I used to love that movie. Especially the robots.
There was another one that scared the heck outta me, Watcher in the Woods I think it was called.
Yeah! I totally remember that. Well, I remember really liking it, but can't actually remember anything other than it was scary.
They need to make a reboot of that. Maybe in the Star Wars universe. I'd watch that for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have your kids seen Blank Check?
No they have not seen it yet but I have
when I was a kid I thought getting a blank check would be so cool
but when you are an adult you realize how illegal that was!
I know, kids in movies always have some drama
it can be so unrealistic though, his parents would have known!
he also had that female teacher coming over, I think she was a teacher
That part was also crazy, now that I think about it that stuff would never happen
I know, but I think that movie is underrated
it is, it was so fun to imagine what would happen
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Toy Story movies?
I have, but I don't remember the most recent ones as well.
I've been rewatching them with my neices and nephews. They're entranced.
I remember being like that when it first came out. I used to love Jessie, but what was Woody's horse named?
Bullseye. I remember being like that too! And being afraid of Sid. I don't remember the more recent ones as well.
Maybe we've just gotten too old.
I don't think so, Andy's grown up with us, and I love that it's something I can share with the younger generations.
I do still love the first few movies. Maybe I'll give the more recent one's another shot.
Let's watch them together! Have a marathon.
I'm in.

We just saw the new Cars movie the other night, Cars 3. It was really good.
I love the Cars movies. Cars 2 wasn't as good as the first, but I was pretty excited about this third one.
Yeah, Cars 2 seemed more like it was about Mater than anything, but it was still fun.
Mater is a great character, but my kids' favorite is Lightning McQueen.
I think they'd really enjoy the new movie then. I'm sure you will too.
Well, Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors, so I'm looking forward to hearing him put one of the characters to life in only the way he could.
I know he's been in a lot of shows, but wasn't there some big movie he was supposed to make an appearance in recently?
He filmed a scene for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but it was cut.
I remember you telling me about that. Man, speaking of great movies...
Definitely! Only movie I've seen more than once in the theater.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the movie Mary Poppins?
Is very old, but I think is amazing! Is still very popular.
Did you hear that there is going to be a new one?
Yes I did! But it´s not a substitute for the first one, is like a one where she returns.
I think is going to be awesome. What is your favorite scene from the original?
When they are tidying up the room with the help of Mary Poppins.
What other things did you find interesting in the movie?
I think Mary Poppins was awesome, how she had a millions things in her bag.
Lastly, what was your favorite song of the movie?
It has to be "A spoon full of sugar", is the best one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch Pete's Dragon?
No. What's that about?
It is an animated Disney film.
I have to check it out.
They are playing it at the local theatre. Would you like to go?
Sure. Lets go.
I think we should see the 3-D version.
I agree! It will enhance the experience.
The first time I saw it was not in 3-D.
Really? I guess it's time for you to relive the experience in 3-D!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Disney Princess?
Hm, I'd say it's a close call between Mulan and Pocahontas.
Neither of those are princesses!
Pocahontas was a chief's daughter and Mulan can be a princess if she wanted to because she saved all of China.
I guess that's true.
I think I'm going to say Mulan, since most of Pocahontas' story isn't historically accurate.
We're talking about historical accuracy in Disney Princesses?
Mulan was based off a Chinese poem, Pocahontas is an important historical character. There's more leeway for fiction than actual historic events!
Fine, fine, I almost regret I asked. My favorite is Rapunzel.
Haha, is that because you're blonde like lizards?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I finally saw Milan today.
For the first time in forever!
Wrong movie, dude.
I know, I was joking around.
Anyway, it was okay.  I think it's the last time I remember Eddie Murphy in anything.
Yeah, he hasn't exactly done much lately, has he?
I thought the movie was pretty good, a bit violent in parts.
Oh, I disagree.  It wasn't violent at all.
We just have different tastes, I guess.
Or you're just over-reacting to a cartoon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Little Mermaid
No, never saw that one
Really? It was a good one back in the day.
I've heard that it was the one that relaunched all the Disney Animated movies
Yes, it had all the good elements and characters like the classic Disney movies
What are some of the examples?
Sebastian the singing crab, Flounder the side kick fish.
Hmm, not sure if that's my cup of tea
I think you'd like the songs. One is called Kiss the Girl.
Okay, maybe I'll check that one out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Frozen is one of the best Disney movies ever produced. The princesses actually solve the problem for themselves and it promotes sisterhood.
I like Frozen, but Tangled in still one of my favorites, Rapunzel's sassy attitude and independence makes the movie for me.
I like Tangled but I don't like how it doesn't really end, is that tear she cried her last bit of magic, or was it not all in her hair?
Oh I know what you mean. I like to think she doens't need the magic anymore and that was her last drop.
I never did really enjoy Princess and the Frog, I find it boring.
I can relate to that as well. Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast live action movie?
I haven't! I can't wait to see it. I hope that it's as good as the reviews said.
I thought it was amazing, and even though I'm not a big fan of Emma Watson, she did a great job.
I still enjoy the classics though, I watched Sleeping Beauty the other day.
It will always be a favorite of mine. I did enjoy Maleficent too, I liked the spin they put on the story, making the prince the enemy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can we imagine a marvel and star wars movie together now
Nah i think even if they own both it will not happen
Why not
because it sounds out there
But it sounds a dream come true
Way to clustery
Do not kill my dreams man
well keep them dreams
But i want them real
Very unlikely man
XXXXXXXXXXX
I will show you the world!
Did you just watch Aladdin again?
Yes. You know it is my favorite movie.
Why??
Jasmine is the greatest Disney princess.
She is pretty cool.
She wasn't just going to marry anyone, and then she met Aladdin and it was love!
I really like that she has a tiger.
And the flying carpet!
Well who wouldn't want a flying carpet?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of The Little Mermaid, now that you've read the original?
I'm surprised they made it so happy! The original story is so sad.
Yeah, but Disney has a magic way of making things feel better.
I know what you mean. Snow White could also be a lot worse.
Right. But they both got happier endings than the original.
Fairy tales can be intense sometimes.
Are there any others that are based on fairy tales?
I think Aladdin is?
That makes sense! It totally has that feeling.
I wonder if the original is also sad?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No I was not a fan of any of them.
Wow thats a shocker.
I mean it was a ride what more can you do.
Its an easy tale to tell.
That doesnt sound promising.
The movie was so good.
Well I can tell.
Though I think the last one did poorly at the Box Office.
Disney needs to kick out more animated films.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Wall-E?
You mean that CGI movie Disney did with the blocky looking robot who loves old musicals?
Yes, that's the movie! Have you seen it?
No, I haven't.
But if you haven't seen it, how do you know so much about it?
I watched a few trailers for the movie. It looks interesting, especially that other robot -- the rounded white one that floats around.
Oh, you must be talking about EVE. Yes, she's amazing as well!
So, you obviously liked it a lot, I'm assuming.
Yes. You would never guess that robots could be so expressive and emotionally endearing as characters.
Well, I definitely need to go see it now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember that movie about the bed that could take you anywhere?
Bed Knobs and Broomsticks?
Yes, that's it... what a crazy movie that was.
Why would you decide to make a magic flying bed, I mean it's not exactly inconspicuous.
No, I agree.   When they travel to Portobello Road and end up in the middle of the market, surely someone would notice.
Is that the scene where they find part of the book?
Yes, and then realise it's only half of it.  They need to travel to the Isle of Naboombu to get the other park from King Leonidas.
I wouldn't like to have a game of that football match.
No, nor me.  I like my legs in one piece!
What a classic, Treguna, Mekoides, Trecorum, Satis, Dee!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, Did you watched the recent movie Beauty and the beast?
Yes, I watched that movie. The animations were excellent
what about you think about the character of Emma Stone?
Yeah, her performance is more obvious and genuine with respect to characterization.
How about the animation and the special VX effects in that movie
Wow! It's great with latest VFX Special Effects Technologies with state-of-the-art entertainment.
what is your notion about the plot and storyline of the movie?
Incredible storyline with just like the fairy-tale stories.
How would you justify about the character of Dan Stevens taking Emma Watson in abduction?
Yes, this is very significant part of the movie in which it's the major screenplay of that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of 'Brave'?
Are you kidding? It's my favorite movie!
Really?
Yea, I love how Merida is strong and doesn't marry anyone in the end.
Yea, that's cool. It teaches girls that they don't have to fall in love so quickly.
Yup and she looks pretty awesome.
Yea, I think the animators actually studied celtic paintings and animated her based on that.
Sweet, loving the historical element!
Yea, that's why I like the movie so much. I love celtic art.
Same!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Pinocchio?
Yea of course, its a classic.
It had a nice blend of comedy and moral lessons
Yea, it would suck if my nose grew every time I lied
It would be an pretty annoying trying to walk
I really liked jiminey cricket
Yea he was voiced by Dickie Jones
His little umbrella was awesome
I love Disney movies
They are my favorite animated movies
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Disney movie?
I really enjoyed the movie Bambi.
Oh, yes, I thought the scenery in Bambi was so pretty.
Not only was the scenery beautiful, but the characters are so endearing.
Yes, my favorite creature was Thumper the rabbit. What was yours?
My favorite was Flower, the skunk! He was so bashful and sweet.
I was a big fan of The Incredibles because of the whole family, each with their own special talent.
I generally like super hero movies but the one was different because Disney storylines don't usually go there.
The endearing characters whose challenging situations tug at the heartstrings are what makes Disney movies great.
I know I can depend on a Disney movie to entertain my whole family.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's pretty cool that Disney is making live action versions of their classic movies.
I know, I can't wait to see what they come out with next.
I looked it up online awhile back, it looks like they are making pretty much all of the animations into live action over the next ten years or so.
Wow, really? Even the Little Mermaid?
Yes, that was on the list.
Yay! I can't wait to see it, it's my favorite.
Haha. It was my favorite when I was younger. I think it's the defiant teenage daughter aspect.
What's your favorite one now?
Beauty and the Beast.
That's a good one too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know if theres going to be an Ant-Man sequel? I really liked that movie.
I heard there is, actually is coming out in 2018.
Thats great news. I think thats a hero that was underated in the Marvel universe.
Yeah but in the last Captain America movie he gained more fame.
Do you like the actor that plays Ant Man.
Yes I do. I think t¿hes a pretty decent actor.
I like that hes funny and fits perfectly into the role.
Yeah he does. He has the acting skills needed for the job.
What do you liked most about the first Ant man movie?
I liked the costume and cast.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Lion Kind was such a classic
I think it was one of the most popular movies
the part when his dad died made my dad cry
it made me cry also ! It was so sad
The hyenia's really scared me, they were so gross
they were, I liked the pig though he was funny
the music was also really good, what was your favorite song ?
The Circle Of Life was the best song in there
It was one of the best, it made you feel like anything was possible
it did and when he grew up he was the king and he had a son, a happy ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana yet?
No, I haven't had a chance to. Should I?
Yes! You would love Moana and Maui. Heihei and Pua are cute, too.
I have heard some of the music, and I like the songs.
"How Far I'll Go" is one of my favorite Disney songs now.
I like that one, too, as well as "You're Welcome."
It's a really pretty movie, too, the water and the beach are amazing looking.
Well, I always like Disney movies with pretty scenes and good music.
I think you'll love it, then.
I will definitely watch it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what sequel, I want?
Which one?
A Treasure Planet 2!
I don't know if they will make one of those.
I can dream.
What would be the plot?
Maybe Jim meets up with Silver sometime later in life.
Like after Jim graduates from the galactic navy or something?
Yes, and they can go on another adventure too.
If we are thinking of the same Long John Silver, the adventure may be to bail him out of trouble or find treasure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the 1950 cinderella movie
Yes but I am afraid I little forgotten, could you please recall the character
Oh my goodness how can you forgot this movie characters, did you remember who is the leading actor in this movie
Yes I know, she is Helene Stanley but I doubt on the story line
Ok let me help you, In beginning Cinderella lives a miserable life as she lost her parents in her early age. Now did you catch something
Yes I know she was a very kind and gentle young woman but her stepsister were jealous I guess from her
Yes the stepsister were jealous because of her beauty but the Cinderella loves a prince you know?
Yes something I know that they wants to marry each other but there both are facing some difficulty, please tell me the climax
In the end both are happily married to each other
Yes now I remember how Cinderella fought and get the good results in the end.Thank you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new beauty in the beast?
Oh with Emma Watson?
Yeah.
No I did not yet. Did you?
Yes I saw it.
It was alright. Emma Watson had an alright voice.
Was it like the original?
Yeah it was very similar.
Do you recommend it?
Yeah give it a try to see if you will like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever think Disney will ever make a new Aladdin movie?
I think so, it's a classic.
I wonder who would star in it as the main characters.
I think Jake Gyllenhaal would play a great Aladdin.
Who do you think would play a good princess Jasmine?
I think Vanessa Hudgens has the right look to play the part.
Wow. That would make quite the cast.
Agreed. I think Disney would deliver if they decided to remake a modern Aladdin.
I think the scenery would be especially great if they shot the movie in the deserts of the Middle East.
It would be fantastic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Moana yet?
We did!  We saw it in the theater when it first came out.
Was it good? We haven't seen it yet!
Oh yes!  We love it.  We own it now.
Oh great!  I saw that it's out on Netflix.
Yes i definitely think it's worth seeing.
We will have to watch it. My kids loved Tangled.
That's another great one.
I enjoy the movies too.
Me too!  I would love to go to Disneyland.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite movie from the nineties?
A goofy movie.
Wow that was a quick answer.
Well yea, it's amazing.
Yea I actually can't believe how many people have seen it.
I think it's getting a big cult following, which makes sense because it's amazing.
Yea. I wanted to go to the possum show when I was a kid. I was heartbroken when my parents told me it wasn't real.
Haha I wanted to buy a power line cd.
Oh man I loved the Powerline songs in that movie.
Yea they were so catchy! I loved goofy's fishing dance at the end too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?
No I haven't seen it but I don't think it's going to be as good as the original.
The remakes never are. Plus it's live action so there's only so much they can do.
That's true. I love Emma Watson though, ever since Harry Potter.
Oh everyone loved her as Hermione. But she's done a pretty good job of getting awa y from that typecast.
You're right, have you seen her in This is the End?
The one with Seth Rogen and James Franco? Yeah that was funny.
I guess I'll take my kids to see Beauty and the Beast. I'm waiting for The Little Mermaid live action.
I think it's coming out next year if I'm not mistaken.
Now that's my personal favorite Disney movie of all time. Part of Your World is a beautiful song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are your favorite characters in the movie Frozen?
One of my favorites is Sven.
Why is the reindeer one of your favorites?
Because he's funny, he has funny facial expressions and is sassy.
So do you have any other favorites?
Yeah I also like Kristoff. He's like a real Prince Charming, without being a prince.
So he saves the girl?
Not really. He realizes he cares for Anna, but thinks she loves another man.
So who saves Anna?
Well, Anna sees Hans try to kill Elsa, so she jumps in front of him before he can kill her and her heart freezes and she turns to ice, and that act of true love is what saves her. Then she unfreezes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think of frozen?
it was great when I first watched it
what do you think now
so overrated
I didn't know it would get so popular
now you still see plushes of them everywhere
backpacks and merchandise are in Walmart
it got oversaturated
it definitely did
it wasn't a bad movie though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to watch the Little Mermaid?
I love that movie! Ariel is the epitome of the Disney princesses.
She was born royal and married royalty.
It always bothered me a little that she gave up who she was for a man she barely knew.
It's the ultimate gesture, though, the willingness to change for love.
She gets to keep her relationship with her family, I guess. She seemed to really want to be human, in any event.
Ever notice how her hair never seems wet?
That's a mermaid trick.mermaid hair always looks flawless.
Ursula was always a scary character when I was young. She is so evil.
If you think about it, though, she is scorned. She lost her power to Tritan, she is just trying to get even.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Disney movie version of The Sword in the Stone?
I think I did, but it's been years since I saw it.
I was just thinking about it the other day and how crazy it was.
I really don't remember much about it other than a scene where the characters turn into fish and sing a song.
I remember that! Do you remember the part where the characters are fighting and the witch turns into different animals?
I think so. It was such a fun movie from my recollection.
I think we should watch it soon. There aren't too many other movies like it out there.
I guess you're right. Not many movies have singing fish scenes these days.
I can't wait to see if it holds up to my childhood expectations!
We'll find out soon enough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard that a live action Mulan movie is being made?
Yeah I'm excited, Mulan is one of my favorite movies.
Mine too I used to watch it all the time as a kid.
I still know all the lyrics to I'll Make a Man Out of You.
That's my favorite song! And the training montage during that song is great.
I really love the dramatic sequence where Mulan cuts her hair and takes her father armor to go war for him.
Also that awesome scene where she takes out the Hun army with an avalanche.
And there's so much humor in that movie too. Mushu had great jokes.
Eddie Murphy as Mushu is hilarious.
Cri-Kee and Mulan's horse were funny too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
