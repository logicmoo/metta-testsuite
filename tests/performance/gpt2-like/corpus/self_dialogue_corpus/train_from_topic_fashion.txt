Why is it that every-time I turn around someone on TV is wearing a blouse with the shoulders cut out?
It is the new in trend, you know.
Why? It is not all that appealing to me.
Really? I think it is sexy. Showing a little skin, it looks good.
Not to me it doesn't.  Some of these hosts already show too much skin as it is if you ask me.
You aren't kidding with that one.
Last night while I was watching the news with my five year old son, the female host dress showed too much cleavage.
This morning, while I was watching the daily news talk shows, one of the hosts was wearing what looked like a halter top.
You're kidding? On national TV?
I sent them an email telling them how I was appalled by her attire.
They probably disregarded your email.
I don't think they did. Because after they returned from there next commercial break, she was wearing blazer over it.
I hate to ask this but did the blazer match her outfit?
No. No it did not. Her halter top was red, her pants were black and the blazer was lime green.
Lime green? I can't imagine how humiliated she must have felt.
I sure she was but when you go on live TV at the time of day when children are watching  and you are dressed like that, then oh well.
You're right. I understand where you are coming from.
Even though she was dressed inappropriately, I actually liked the earrings she was wearing.
What did they look like?
They were circular dangles with what look like blue gemstones going down the middle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm making my baby's clothes instead of buying them.
That's an interesting idea. It seems like no one does that anymore.
I like having control over fabric and style.
Are you good at it? I've never seen you sew.
I sew pretty well. I learned years ago.
Maybe you could design something for me to wear to my wedding then.
I surely could. Let's start now.
OK. First of all I like white for a wedding dress.
Good choice. Any particular style?
I like it to be tight at the top with a bell shaped skirt.
That sounds lovely.
And I'd like beading on the skirt.
Maybe pearls?
Maybe.
Or crystals?
I'm sure either would be fine.
Maybe you could have both.
That's what I'd like.
This is going to be a beautiful dress.
Thanks for helping with it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, where did you get those shoes from?
I got these from Ross.
How much did they cost?
I believe I paid less than 20 dollars for them.
That's a great deal. Do you always get your shoes from Ross?
No, I just saw that these were on sale, so I took advantage.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what do you think about this summers fashion?
Oh, i really like the fact that they're bringing back the off the shoulder looks.
Have you seen any of the new sandal trends?
No, i haven't seen any of them yet.  What are the styles this year?
Well, from what I've seen, they're bringing back the gladiator styles.
Really?  Like the small ankle high ones?
Yeah, I've seen the small ankle ones plus the calf length.
Oh, i don't like those at all.  They look too busy when you're wearing them.
Yeah, if you're not careful with what you pair them with, you could really have a massive train wreck ensemble.
I prefer my Birkenstocks over any designer shoe anywhere.
Oh, don't you like the fact that the department stores are using actual plus sized models now?
Yes!  Its beyond amazing that people in the upper echelons finally figured out that hardly anyone is a size zero.
I'm just glad that they're actually using a plus sized model, like she's a size 14-16.
Yeah, usually they call a gal who is a size 8-12 "plus size".  This is hardly the case.
I really appreciate the fashion commercial spots that Target has out there.  They were the first company to use a real woman in their spot.
Kinda changes the way I see Target now.  They're doing very well for women nowadays.
Want to know what I miss the most?  The long flowing full pesant skirts.
Well, you can still wear them! Be your own fashon statement!
Oh i plan on it, I'm just annoyed that I can't purchase any new ones.
Well, this summer hopefully will be full of awesome surprises with fun things to wear!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Those sunglasses the rapper Pitbull made famous are still popular. It's amazing.
It sure is, I see them everywhere I go. But I saw them on Amber Heard first.
Did you really? Everybody calls them "Pitbulls."
I  know that. That's because he wore them first?
Yeah, and at one time he endorsed them.
You mean he doesn't any more?
No, he definitely doesn't. He's fighting with the company that produces them.
So he's wearing some other kind?
I guess so.
I wonder if people will wear the ones he used to wear because of the publicity, or his new pick.
Because of that publicity, you mean.
Well, people always want to wear the newest thing.
That's true. The latest style is what they want.
So you're supposed to constantly update your look.
Sure. To show that you know what's going on in the world.
Well, I guess I don't. I wouldn't even recognize Pitbull.
But you'd recognize his sunglasses.
Yep. And I'd wear them, too.
Well, that's fashion.
Yes it is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the pictures from fashion week of the Balenciaga catwalk?
Some of them, why?
Those jackets with the huge 1980s shoulder pads are too much.
I know! Sometimes I wonder who wears some of the fashion from the runway.
The jackets were so boxy and the shoulder pads were huge.
There were a lot of sheer pieces during spring fashion week too.
I saw a pair of sheer trousers that looked like clear plastic trash bags.
I know, right?
I did like the sheer lace dresses that Dolce and Gabanna were showing.
I did too but I didn't like the lace ruffle at the bottom.
I thought the ruffle at the bottom was actually kind of cute.
Speaking of sheer and showing it off, there were a ton of bralettes shown.
The one that Kendall Jenner wore was kind of cute. The black scrappy one that went around her neck and crisscrossed in the front.
That was cute. It was just really basic. There were some beautiful ones that weren't as basic. There were florals and even some velvet bralettes.
I must have missed those. I'm not sure about bralettes as a fashion piece for wearing in public anyway.
I think they can be really pretty with high waisted pants or skirts.
I actually really like that look. That way a smaller portion of the stomach shows.
Exactly.
Maybe I will look for a bralette/high waisted skirt combo next time I'm shopping.
Yes, you should. See if anyone makes that in a floral.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the top fashion trend on 2017?
I think it would be the fact that everyone is wearing knitted and tight fitting clothing.
Really? I thought for sure it was all the bright stripes and colors that everyone seems to be wearing.
You know, that is a really good one too. I think there are a few new fashion trends this year.
A lot of girls are also wearing their bras out now.
Yeah, that is true. Though I'm not sure I am a big fan of that trend.
Personally, I will always be a big fan of the florals. They always seem to come back.
Yes! Florals reminds me of the 80's trend that is slowly coming back.
You're right. It seems more and more that people are dressing like they used to in the 80's and 90's.
Very true. A lot of times clothes don't even match anymore and everyone still seems to love it.
I do see that a lot. They wear colors like orange and purple and everyone thinks that it looks good.
I think that mismatched colors can look good, but sometimes people get a little carried away with the combinations.
I've noticed that a lot of the stars like to really follow the newest fashion trends.
I've noticed that too. They wear this stuff even if it does not look good on them.
Then again, sometimes the stars start the fashion trends.
Especially like the Kardashians. They seem to always be starting some new trend.
Yeah, like the trend with the clear boots.
Those things looked so uncomfortable. I dont understand why anyone would want to wear them.
I guess we can both agree that a lot of the new fashion trends are a little crazy and uncomfortable.
Yes they are, and still people love to wear these things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the best dressed at the Dior Fashion show?
Rihanna for sure, did you see her dress?
I loved her cowboy hat and her furry dress.
Did you see Charlize Theron's outfit?
I did! It was to die for.
Her head to toe black ensemble was stunning.
I liked her shades!
I know! I want to steal them for me!
What about Demi Moore?
She also wore black with a long skirt.
She did! She had the country vibe going for her.
I also liked Brie Larson's outfit!
She is a blonde bombshell!
Her black suit jacket was sleek.
And her patterned skirt! That was one of my favorites.
Let's talk about Kiernan Shipka and her dress!
I am in LOVE with her black velvety dress!
Me too! So sophisticated.
And that choker!
It completes the outfit entirely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your must have items for summer this year?
I really want a shorts jumper, I saw Kim Kardashian wearing it, so trendy!
Yes, I think I saw her in that too, looks very cute dressed up or down!
I saw in Vogue Magazine that stripes and bold prints were all over the runway, and also the jumpsuits like you mentioned.
I've also been noticing a lot of people dressing up sportswear lately.
So true!! Kate Hudson made her own line of fashionable sportswear I keep seeing the commercial for it.
I have a pair of matching leggings and tank from her, its called Fabletics, super cute and not too expensive.
I like the whole idea of being comfortable enough to get all my daily things done but not looking dumpy in sweats. Im going to check it out online tonight.
I feel like every store I walk into at the mall has their own line of sports wear now, everything looks very feminine and tailored.
What is the one trend this year that you refuse to wear?
Chunky shoes!! These were popular when I was a teenager but I just feel they are too clunky, especially since I am tall and full figured.
That make sense, chunky shoes are not for everyone! What shoes do you like then?
I love a pretty jeweled sandal. I can wear them with a fancy dress or with jeans, I like a shoe that can take me from day to night. Plus then I feel like I get my moneys worth.
What do you think of Melanie Trumps fashion? Money is no object there!
Honestly, I think her fashion sense is amazing! She went from Victoria Secrets Angel to a stunning first lady!
She recently wore a white eyelet dress by Giambattista Valli, it was so simple and elegant.
She really picks the right wardrobe for the occasion, never misses a beat!
Now with summer coming, Im curious to see how she will still dress appropriate in the heat. She is tasteful though, so I have no doubt.
Another celebrity whose fashion I adore is Miley Cyrus. I know she is not typically an icon, but she is just so different than everyone else.
I'm going to check out a photo gallery of her online, because I don't think Ive seen too much of her fashion style, and I love getting new ideas.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi!  What are you doing today?
I'm not sure.  I have a bit of free time today.
Do you want to go shopping?
Sure.  Where do you want to meet up?
Let's meet at the mall.  I need a new dress.
Ok.  I'll see you there in about 20 minutes.
I'm glad you were able to meet me.
No problem.  I have nothing else to do.
Good, you can help me pick out a dress to wear to my cousin's wedding.
Oh, I love weddings.
Me too! This wedding should be much fun, but I feel I need a new fashionable dress to wear to the event.
I totally understand.
Let's go into this store.  I see some cute dresses.
How about this dress.  I like the soft material and it's strapless.  It will be perfect for the wedding.
I like the color and style, but I'm not fond of strapless dresses. Do you see anything that is cute, sleeveless, but not strapless.
Oh, this one is totally cute.  Do you like the stripes?
I love the stripes!  This is it and they have my size.
Try it on!
Too cute.  I'm getting this one, what do you think?
I love it.  You'll be the best dressed at the wedding-besides the bride of course!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Now, Naomie Harris really had a stunning dress!
That white Calvin Klein? Gorgeous!
Speaking of stunning in white, Priyanka Chopra's geometrical gown was absolutely beautiful.
I agree, it fit her to a 'T'. Ralph & Russo should be proud.
There was plenty of gold on this red carpet!
Emma Stone giving flapper chic in Givenchy and Halle Berry also went with some gold fringe with her gown. Both were sparkling!
There certainly were some sparkling gems on the carpet!
Yes,  that gorgeous Bvulgari necklace draped around Alicia Vikander's neck!
There were a lot of great suits this year as well.
Dev Patel looked bright and chic in his white Burberry jacket and Justin Timberlake's Tom Ford couldn't have fit better!
It was so great to see Jessica Biel step out of her box and wear that to-die-for gold gown.
She always looks great on the red carpet but I agree this is one of her better dresses!
Lots of my favorite gals are sporting super short hair cuts right now which I love!
I wish I could pull off Ginnifer Goodwin's look, that short hair and the red gown.
Pharrell looked relatively tame this year.
He still found a way to add a little flair though with that long jacket and simplified frill-shirt, I can appreciate that.
There were some pretty fun colors on this red carpet too! That brighter navy blue suit that Riz Ahmed wore was so spring-y!
He would have looked great standing next to Leslie Mann in her yellow gown. She looked like Belle from Beauty and the Beast!
I think one of my absolute favorite dresses was that silver and creme fringe dream that Sofia Boutella wore!
I think we can both agree, you can never go wrong with wearing Chanel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the pictures from the MET gala?
Yes I did. There were some great outfits this year?
Who do you think had the most creative dress?
Rihanna's dress was really artistic and captured the theme.
I think Traci Ellis Ross had a dress by the same designer.
Yeah I think her dress was great too.
Who do you think was the worst dressed?
Well Selena Gomez's dress was really simple and boring. It looked very off-the-rack.
I agree. I don't think any of the men's outfits were very interesting either.
Do you think high-water pants are appropriate for a tuxedo?
You're right. I saw a lot of ill-fitting pants. With men's pants, tailoring is really important.
I know. Did you see Joe Jonas' outfit?
Was he wearing corduroy?
I think it was corduroy or velvet.
Well either way, it looked really silly.
He looked like a red carpet.
Ha ha ha. You're too funny. His brother's tuxedo was nice though.
I agree. Some of the designers dressed multiple people, but some celebrities looked better than others.
Like Zac Posen?
Yes! I can't believe the dress he made for Amy Schumer. She looked like a trash bag. Meanwhile Katie Holmes looked stunning.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Met gala last week?
The Met gala no. What's that?
It's an event in New York where people wear crazy fashion.
No. I didn't. I love red carpet apparel.
I do too. I like it when the celebrities tell who they are wearing. Oscar de la renta
Vera wang or what about Christian Seriano.
Didnt he dress Leslie Jones from SNL when no one else wanted to because of her size?
Yes. Christian won me over fter than. Fat and fashipn shaming is wrong.
I agree. More designers should cater to all body types. What about the plus size model who is out now.
Yes. I love her. She looks good in everything. i saw her in a Versace dress the other day.
That has to be made to fit her because Versace is normally for the 0-4 range.
I also like to look fashionalbe on a budget. I found so many websites that have nice clothes cheap.
I love a bargin. my aunt goes to the salvation army every weekend. She finds so many designer fashions.
Lijke what? i can never find anything good.
She finds Coach and Cold water Creek. Cashe and black house white market all the time.
Is the fashion she finds gently used?
Yes. You would never know it was hand-me-down.
Sweet. I find a lot of high fshion on eBay. Kenneth Cole is my husbands favorite.
Yes. You can get some good deals online.
I agree. High dollar fashion and cheap rates.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you wearing those earrings to your brother's wedding?
The skull ones? Yes.
It's a wedding, not a funeral. Wear something appropriate.
Okay. I'll wear my black rose earrings.
That's not much better. What else are you wearing?
My gothic cyber retro dress.
You're not serious are you?
What? My brother knows what I like to wear.
That's not important. It's a wedding, wear something nice.
What do you suggest then?
I'm glad you asked. I bought you this lovely teal dress with matching heels.
Teal? Really?
It came with a lovely handbag and lace gloves.
Teal isn't my color, you know that.
Too bad. You're wearing it.
Maybe I can mix it up with something in my wardrobe.
With what? All you have is black.
That's not true.
Isn't it?
No. I wear blood red colors too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember when Calvin Klein was the big designer to buy years ago?
Yes but now it's Gucci, AG and J Brand jeans that are popular.
True Religion are some of the most expensive jeans you can buy today.
Yes, those and Miss Me is what all the young people are wearing.
Funny thing, older people seem to like NYDJ.
What does NYDJ stand for?
It means "Not Your Daughter's Jeans."
I have never heard of those. I remember Levis was the only jeans anyone would wear.
i remember there was a company that put your own name on your jeans.
So I could become an instant designer?
Yeah, and Amazon Merch allows you create and sell your own T shirt designs.
I bet you and I could make a lot of money cerating and selling T Shirts on Amazon.
You got any ideas.
Yeah, what about "Dump The Trump?"
Hey, that 's pretty good and I bet it will sell.
I don't know I just thought of that.
That's how people become millionares in this country.
How do I get a copyright for my idea?
Go online, Google Copyright office and download the forms.
I think I will. Look Amazon here I come!
XXXXXXXXXXX
And Jessica Lange's gold earrings and necklace accented her Vera Wang little black cocktail dress greatly.
Yes! Correct it was a stunning dress and appropriate for her age, makes her look beautiful.
Now lets see oh! There's Denzel Washington standing by Chris Rock in their Versace tailored black suits with gold  suit cufflinks.
Oh! yes but Denzel Washington did look very sexy in that fitted Versace tailored black suit.
Who was the best dressed in Red at this year Oscars for the ladies?
I am not sure but I love Emma Watson flowing Red gown by Prada she looked hot.
And there's another actress whom we haven't seen on the red carpet in years.
Yes! I see its a blast from the past the lovely Linda Carter who played wonder woman and in her shimmering gold strapless dress.
Love Linda Carter's gold dress and its by designer Oscar de la Renta.
Do you see Matt Damon now on the red carpet talking with Linda Carter in a fine silk gray suit by Ralph Lauren with black silk tie.
Yes! I see Matt and with his wife in a stunning classic sky blue evening gown by Vera Wang with beautiful diamond earrings.
Look fashion alert!  its katie Perry in that horrible green dress and it looks like green vomit a fashion No No.
I agree and did Katie truly looked in the mirror before coming here.
I guest not and on now the red carpet its Taylor Swift in a sexy silver strapless two-piece design by Prada and she always looked great.
I agree you can't go wrong with Prada and that diamond necklace Taylor wearing is lovely as well.
I see Tom Cruise coming up on the red carpet talking to Ms. Swift in a silk dark forest suit with a silk black tie by designer Versace.
Oh! to me Tom Cruise does look great in everything he wears no matter the designer.
Well I saw Tom Cruise ex-wife Katie Holmes a while ago and she also looks stunning in Ralph Lauren simple black evening gown.
Its almost close to starting time for the Oscar awards and there's a bad fashion alert!
I see what you mean its that ugly floral garden print Goldie Hawn is wearing. We say goodbye and enjoy the Oscars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is in style this season?
I've been seeing a lot of shoulder baring tops lately!
Ah, kind of an 80s throwback?
Definitetly. I'm feeling those Flashdance vibes. I've also seen a lot of bright colorful stripes.
I love that color is in right now, I was so ready for it! I've also seen a lot of large bags on the runways.
YES, that is so great for those of us who carry around everything but the kitchen sink. Do you like the utilitarian trend?
Honestly, I don't like anything khaki.
Oh, me either. It's so boring. There are some interesting shapes, though.
I really love the statement t-shirts I've been seeing.
I do too, what a great way to show personality! It also helps that they are comfortable. And the big earrings!
I love a good statement piece. I can't believe platform shoes are back, though.
I know, it feels very 90s. Not my favorite style decade.
I agree - give me 70s inspired fashion anyday!
I'm more of an 80s gal myself. Those colors! I'm also really loving the exposed bra trend.
Me too! We spend so much on bras, it's time to show them off!
I'm not sure how I feel about the athletic wear trend, though.
I don't care for it - it definitely doesn't suit me. I think it would take an athletic person to look natural in those clothes.
It's definitely not for everyone, that's for sure. I'm just glad there are so many different things going on in fashion right now!
Me too, there's something for everyone. I'm going to be rocking the bare shoulders all summer.
I'll join you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the photos of everyone's outfits from the Met Gala?
Yes! Rihanna definitely stole the show there.
I agree. Did you see the exchange she had with Zendaya?
No, what happened?
She posted a photo of Zendaya's beautiful dress and called her a goddess.
Aw, that's so sweet. What other dresses did you like?
So many of them. I didn't like any of the Kardashian's though.
I agree. I wasn't a huge fan.
I think it's interesting to see the lengths to which female celebrities dress up, and  the men just wear standard suits.
Yeah. But that's society for you.
Do you remember Taylor swift's look from the last met gala?
The metallic dress with the lace up shows, platinum blonde hair and lipstick?
Yeah, that one. I can't decide if I liked it or hated it.
She coordinated well with Zayn, even though they weren't there together.
Yeah. With his bionic arm. I think the Hadid sisters had diamonds in their manicure.
Of course they did.
I am really a fan of long, flowy dresses that are simple and timeless.
I think anything can look good as long as the person is happy in it.
Selena and The Weeknd looked interesting.
Her outfit made her look very young,
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what is the color of the year 2017, Deon?
Yeah. They are calling it greenery.
Greenery?
They says greenery is symbolic of new beginnings.
Because of spring and grass growing and stuff like that, right?
Yeah, but why did you say it like that?
Like what?
Like you don't like the color of green.
Because I don't like green.
How can you not like green? Greenery is nature’s neutral.
True but I like reds and pink.
Greenery is also emblematic of the pursuit of personal passions and vitality. Green is life.
I hear you but nah, I don't like it.
Pair a green button up shirt with a pair of black jeans and green bow in your hair and you will be stunning.
Do you think so? You aren't just saying that?
Green is a good color. It goes with just about anything.
Why aren't you wearing green ?
I am. Look at my peridot bracelet.
Wow! That is a gorgeous piece of jewelry.
Thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the red carpet fashion at the Met Gala this year?
There were so many beautiful gowns. It's hard to choose which one I liked the best.
I thought Kate Hudson looked gorgeous as always in her long white Stella McCartney gown.
I agree, I loved that it was simple and clean.
I liked that it was sleeveless on one side.
Giselle Bundchen stunned in Stella McCartney as well!
Definitely, her pewter embroidered Stella McCartney gown was to die for.
My favorite part of that gown was the very low cut of the back.
That was my favorite part too.
The glass bead embroidery on that dress was amazing. It must have taken forever to create.
I thought the grey Tom Ford tuxedo that Tom Brady wore to match was beautiful as well.
The color and cut of that tuxedo jacket were impeccable. It was a perfect match.
They did a good job keeping her makeup subtle so that it didn't overpower her gown.
The whole outfit was a home run.
It was, and the high pony was a great choice.
I loved that she paired the high pony with diamond drop earrings.
I wish I could find out who makes the marble print box clutch that Giselle was carrying.
I'm not sure who made it either.
There were a lot of people on the red carpet who pushed boundaries and went with some very risky fashion choices.
I know, oftentimes red carpet fashion is better when it's simple elegance rather than when it looks like someone is trying to hard to push the envelope.
XXXXXXXXXXX
1990s fashion is really making a comeback right now.
I know, it's really popular and shows no signs of slowing down.
I'm seeing a lot of neon accents and slip dresses.
Me too, Michelle Williams just recently wore a lace Louis Vuitton slip dress.
Remember Courtney Love used to always wear them with tiaras?
Yes, she really grunged it up.
A bob haircut with bangs is popular again too.
Drew Barrymore had the coolest bob and bangs combo in the 90s.
Taylor Swift has the bob and bangs combo hairstyle now.
I read that track pants are coming back into fashion as well.
Like the ones that Sporty Spice used to wear?
Yes, Rihanna just released similar track pants for her Fenty collection.
I'm definitely not attached to the track pants style.
I could take it or leave it.
I love the cuffed jeans style that is back now though.
Me too, I love a nice fitting pair of boyfriend jeans with a cuff at the bottom.
Yes, with a tank top and button down shirt.
Or a sweater, something that hangs nicely. Nothing too fitted.
That's one of my favorite outfits.
Me too, through on a pair of converse sneakers and you're good to go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I read that bell bottom jeans are coming back in style. What do you think about it?
I'm not sure I would wear them, but seems like everything that has gone out of style eventually come back.
I think I would wear them, or at least try some on. I like that whole hippie, bohemian look.
I've noticed neon colors are coming back as well.
I won't wear neon, it's just too bright. I have seen some really pretty choker necklaces though.
I would totally wear those, I've seen them too in so many different styles and colors.
Have you seen Betsy Johnson's new line?
No,not yet, looks like I will have to google it and take a look.
She's got so many cute shirts, purses and pajamas.
That she does. Seems like I can't get enough of her stuff.
I love her stuff too, not many people like her stuff though.
Everyone's tastes in clothing, etc is different.
Guess that's what makes us unique then.
I suppose so.
Another brand I like is the Lucky brand, I love the jewelry and clothes.
Me too, it's just so hard to find at a decent price.
Well, you know we both have excellent taste, although it may be a tad to expensive for our small salaries.
Yes, I know.
All this talk about clothing has made me want to go shopping. You want to go see if T.J. Maxx has any new Betsy Johnson stuff in ?
Sure, let's go check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite part of Awards Season is the fashion!
I love the intresting looks that stars wear to the Met Gala.
Yes! This years Gala was full of designs by Kawakubo.
And every year since Anna Wintour's first year as Met Gala chair in 1995, the event has featured honorary hosts from the worlds of entertainment and fashion.
Did you know that this year's co-chairs are Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen?
No, but I loved Katy Perry's outfit in May's Vogue in honor of the upcoming gala.
Kawakubo, is a 74-year-old Japanese designer who founded Comme des Garçons in 1969, is only the second living designer honored by the Costume Institute, along with Saint Laurent.
She has defined the aesthetics of our time, by inviting us to rethink fashion as a site of constant creation, recreation, and hybridity,
A-listers and top designers bring out their most impressive, over-the-top and memorable outfits for the red carpet.
I loved Sarah Jessica Parkers look!
Sarah Jessica Parker has been a top fashionista ever since her role as Carrie Bradshaw on Sex in the City.
Yes, without her influence, I might never have known how great Manolo Blahnik shoes were!
President Trump proposed to Melania during the Met Gala in 2004.
Yes, it is definitely a high profile event. I loved Melania's dress that night.
Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston's romance was borne of their Met Gala dance-off in 2016. She looked spectacular.
Yes, and his suit was so dapper.
Historically, guests are also supposed to dress in the fashions of the gala's honored designer, a tradition that often turns controversial.
The Kardashian sisters love to stir up controversy at the Gala. Especially Kim!
Did you see the Olsen twins outfits?
Yes, straight vintage! I'm not a fan of vintage, but they definitely pulled it off!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see her shoes?
Who, Emma's shoes?
Yes!
They looked like Valentino's, with the red soles, just perfect!
Yesssss, it would be a dream to own a pair of those.
Yes, it would! Did you see their make up too?!
It looks like they used either MakeUp Forever or it could have been Nars, or maybe MAC
And the eyelash extensions! They really help open up their eyes.
I hear that man buns are really in now too. The thing where guys pull their hair back on top into a mini bun thing. Have you seen that?
Yes! I kinda like how it looks, it has to be the right kind of guy to pull of the look.
Who has the the look to pull it off? Hmmm maybe Jared Leto?
Yeah, definitely. What other fashion trends did you see at the Oscars that you liked?
A lot of people had neat highlights, the new ombre thing from dark to light is a pretty cool new look.
Yeah! I would do that look if I had the money to support it, haha.
Same here! Did you see that all the celebrities wore jewelry by Baccarat? It also looked like they had Swarovski diamonds on their shoes, and dresses.
Bling is super in right now, so is rose gold metallic.
True. Did you like seeing Kim Kardashian's sister's new revenge body? I couldn't believe how good she looked in that Oscar de la Renta dress.
She looked awesome! Must be nice to have so much help in having a personal trainer and private chefs.
Yeah agreed.. I love seeing the fashion, it's so fun! The Oscars is like prom for celebrities.
Totally. It's always fun to see who wore what best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i also dig cooper 's outfit
oh really,i thought it was too colorful for a guy like cooper.
i wouldn't think so,as the jacket had patches of black
true though.
do you think will smith was too casual ?
oh not at all, i just felt he wanted to keep it simple and just do the white long sleeve and black pant,
i felt its a terrible way to dress for an event like the oscar.
that's how you see it,but what you'd call casual is well worth $6000
nah it can be that expensive,i would say $2000
oh no way,do you think will smith will rock a sleeve,black pant,a Paul smith shoe and Hermes belt for a piety $2000,it should be way more than that.
if what will smith wore you think would cost $6000 then what would you say of Daniel Craig who was just so stunning and stole the red carpet.
oyeah Daniel was actually the man on the red carpet , that jacket was way too cool,his stylist must have put a great deal in making him look that way.
stylist?i heard he styles himself.
if he does then he could make some extra more money being a stylist.lol
oyeah. so about the purse you want to buy which have you decided to purchase.
am still  indecisive
why don't you check out the CHANNEL  purse Jenifer Lawrence had on for the Oscars i think it was lovely
yeah i love that purse jenny had, would have been a good choice but then i reckon it would be  too expensive.
true though but you should check for the price first as CHANNEL purses are not that all expensive
OK i would check to see if i can afford it.

Who is your favorite fashion designer?
I really love Alexander McQueen.
What do you like about McQueen's designs?
I love the imaginative creativity of his designs.
They are very original and organic, aren't they.
Yes. Very lovely, and very well thought out.
I imagine in is difficult for the current head designer, Sarah, to match his design capabilities?
Yes, I a sure. I believe they are using a mix of his older designs that were never made public.
That is a good idea.
Yes. It keeps the essence of his fashion house alive even though he is gone.
It was nice to see the Duchess of Cambridge have his house design her wedding gowns for the Royal Wedding, wasn't it.
Absolutely gorgeous.
It was classic McQueen, but not over the top.
Right. Both of her gowns had a nice touch of delicacy to them.
Yes. A bit less costume, and bit more elegance.
Are you enjoying McQueen's current season?
Yes. The lace and yarn dresses are very nice
I agree. I am enjoying the rustic colored color palette.
Yes. The colors, fabrics, and leather goods have a bit of a western feel.
I agree. Very relaxed, but still very Alexander McQueen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Look at this awesome scarf! It's leopard print and supr soft.
That is cute. You should buy it.
I love the scarf look. I wear them all the time.
I don't but I've noticed how good they look on you.
Here's another one. Which is better?
Get both. They're on sale.
This one has clovers on it and I love that. I think I will get both.
Do you ever wear them on your hair?
No, but do you think I'd look good.
I do actually but it has to be the right kind of scarf.
True. Do you see any that would work.
I think maybe this red one. It's the right kind anyway.
How about this orange one?
Yes and it's a better color. Get it.
I already have the other two.
You'll look so cute, though.
OK. How can I resist that?
You can't. Now let's go before we find even more.
We should. I love buying accessories.
Me too. I have so many.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about this summer's fashion?
I love the air flow and festival vibe.
I love the way skirts are long and airy.
I like the incorporation of bralettes.
Bralettes are nice and make throwing on a cute shirt easy.
I love throwing on a cool tank top over one.
Leggings are too hot to wear during summer.
Leggings can be sweaty and appear lazy.
They are on the way out except as pajamas.
I like shorts at night.
I have new linen shorts for this season.
I have a pair of pale blue ones.
Pale but colorful pieces are going to be a summer trend.
I have a pair of yoga mat sandlas to wear with my new shorts.
Comfortable sandals are a must.
They match my shorts also a must.
Platform sandals look good but make it hard to walk.
I agree. Good old flip flops for me. The most comfortable.
I can't wait to be walking around tanning my legs with my new anklet.
Foot jewelry will dress up flip flops, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I went to the mall last night and saw that forever 21 started to sell men's cloths.
Really? What are they selling?
I just saw men's watches.
Really,I wonder why?
I heard they want to see if men would shop their. I may consider it.
What wetter you ding in there already?
I was with my girlfriend, what do you think?
Sorry man, just playing with you.
Thanks, but the watches they had looked really nice and not that expensive.
What was the price range?
I saw some $25 to $60
Not bad.
I know, but how long will they last?
No kidding.
They had a few with leather bands and metal bands.
Did the leather lot real?
It did.
What color? Brown and black
Want to check them out later?
Sure
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to help me design a dress for a competition I'm going to be in?
Sure. Any special criteria?
No. It can be any dress.
How about doing something with these cool watermelon shaped buttons I have?
Those are so cool? Where did they come from?
I saw them at a craft shop but never used them after I bought them. You may have them.
Thanks so much. They're so cute.
You're welcome. Let's do a red dress with some kind of black trim and those buttons.
That sounds amazing.
Do you actually sew it or just design it?
You actually make it.
Let's use something summery then, a light fabric.
I agree. Watermelon is a summer thing.
Yes. Want to go to the store for the materials together?
Yes. The deadline is in 30 days.
I can go whenever.
We need material and something for the black trim.
Not lace.
No, maybe just another kind of material.
This is going to be the cutest dress.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the new fashion for men?
No, do tell
You won't believe it!
Try me.
It's a romper for men.
A romper, like a one-piece?
Yes, like a onesie, but shorter.
Are they wearing it here?
Maybe not yet, but wait for summer.
Who it selling them?
I'm not sure
Have you seen it in person yet?
Not yet, just seen it on TV.
Hopefully I won't see it anywhere else.
I bet you really want one.
Not hardly, this fad will pass quickly.
Don't be so sure, this one has legs.
Legs, I get it.
I might get one.
I hope not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh hey its forever 21, lets go inside!
Oh my god look at those cheap spaghetti tank top, heck yah lets go in!
Oh wow those tank tops look so cute.
So should I buy all the colors?
I mean if you don't have any of the colors, I say go ahead! Oh look there's two different styles!
Oh you're right! One has an adjustable strap while the other one is just stretchy.
I like them both. I'm grabbing them all, hahaha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What were some of your favorite looks at the Met gala this year?
I loved Rhianna's dress, she really followed the theme this year.
Oh, that's right, the theme was about the fashion of Comme des Garçons.
Caroline Kennedy wore Comme des Garçons and looked amazing.
I thought Madonna looked interesting, I think Jeremy Scott designed her dress.
I remember her dress, it was a military theme, and she wore gloves.
Who else wore Comme des Garçons to the Met gala?
I'm not sure, I think Anna Wintour actually wore Chanel.
Lena Dunham wore a really pretty dress to the gala.
I recall her outfit, it was really elegant and had a very long train.
The men didn't really stand out at the gala, fashion wise.
No, but Roger Federer wore a Gucci jacket that was interesting.
A lot of ladies wore gloves this year, maybe that's a new trend.
It could be, I like long gloves as an accessory to bring out the colors in an ensemble.
I'm not sure if I would have followed the theme either this year, Rei Karakubo's clothes are very eccentric.
Yes, her runway shows are far out, but her ready to wear is far more down to earth.
I just remembered that the girlfriend of someone famous wore a nice Comme des Garçons dress, it was oddly shaped.
I think odd shapes are a nice signature of Rei Karakubo's work for Comme des Garçons, it's hard to pull that off, but she does.
Shoes did not really seem to garner much attention at the gala this year.
No, but I saw a rapper wearing Louboutins, I didn't know they made those for men!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the outfits at the Met Gala this year?
Yes, wasn't Rihanna's outfit crazy?
It looked like it was made of old wallpaper. But Halle Berry's dress was great.
I loved that it looked like record albums.
I loved Chrissy Teigen's dress, too.
I know, and John Legend in his white dinner jacket was a nice accessory.
Speaking of men, Kanye's starburst jacket was pretty cool.
Yeah, but Kim's dress was awful.
Not as awful as Pharrell Williams' wife, though.
She looked like an inflatable Gumby doll.
You know who looked surprisingly good, though? Janelle Monae.
Yes, she wasn't as crazy as she is sometimes. I liked the feather skirt.
Jennifer Lopez was pretty toned-down, too.
Her dress was a pretty color, but really blah style.
Serena Williams, too: great color, bland style.
Oh, I didn't see her. What was it like?
Gorgeous green, full skirt, vee neck. It showed off her baby bump nicely.
Maternity red carpet looks are always a mixed bag.
Agreed. Chrissy Teigen always wore great maternity clothes.
Yup. And Jenna Tatum, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that patterns will work well this summer?
No. It's 2017.
They're light.
They're too busy on the eyes.
Then what will work?
That's a good question. Black. White.
You like simple?
Yes I like simple.
Then how about colors like yellow?
A pale yellow with sheer material...?
No.
Alright. No.
How about silver?
Silver could work though likely bronze or gold...?
A short pants leg?
Maybe.
What about summer dresses?
I like flowy material somewhat.
Then what about floral prints on a dark background?
Solid. With a touch of silver. Too much?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the fashion at the 2017 MTV Movie Awards? What did you think?
I did! I thought Zendaya and Hailee Steinfield looked beautiful.
They were both named best dressed!
I didn't know that. That's awesome. I didn't like Noah Cyrus' outfit. Too baggy and too black.
I agree. She looked like she was in her pajamas. Didn't seem appropriate.
Katherine Langford from "13 Reasons Why" looked beautiful in the red dress she was wearing.
She did. I thought the entire cast of "13 reasons why" looked great. Almost like they blended well together.
Did you see Kendall Jenner's outfit? What did you think?
I did. I thought it was a mess. I didn't like the strings that were all over her legs. Looked cheap to me.
Agreed. She's so beautiful, she could've worn something more tasteful.
Rebel Wilson looked great at the MTV Movie Awards. She looks like she's lost weight, too.
I thought she looked like she lost weight, too. I didn't care for her dress though. It was cut weird around her arm.
I hated Emma Watson's outfit. I thought she looked like a gladiator. It was weird to me.
Yes, the sequins were way too much. I didn't get that look at all.
Amber Rose looked hot in the red dress. That color looked awesome on her.
She did look good, but her chest is too big. It looked like it was popping out of the dress.
Farrah Abraham from "Teen Mom" looked like a disaster. She is a trainwreck.
I completely agree! She looked like she was ready to pop out of a bottle and grant wishes. Yuck.
Zac Efron looked very handsome. His outfit reminded me of a 50s type style.
I didn't think I would like all the white on him, but you're right, it did look nice!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the 8 Most Wearable Spring 2017 Fashion Trends?
No. You know I don't let my style be guided by stuff like that.
I know but one can plan their style for the season with those trends.
How?
For instance, the slogan tees.
What about them?
We can be political, feminists or be our own heroes with those tees while looking like we are on trend.
Oh, please. I don't need fashion gurus to tell me I need to wear a t-shirt with a slogan on it to be cool.
I hear you and yes you are right. But with those tees you can spread your message without saying a word at all.
I already do that. Look at the shirt I am wearing now.
Cool slogan "I am the boss of me." Why did you wear that today?
My crazy boss seems to think he owns me just because I work for him.
Wait. You wore that shirt to your job?
Yes, I did. He got the message and I was fired.
Awwh. I'm sorry to hear that but now we can see what is on trend for interview attire.
You never stop do you?
No. Now pink is in this year and it is an empowering color.
I thought they said red was empowering.
Pink is too.
Next thing you know they will be saying lemonade yellow is the empowering color of the year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the movie and tv music awards?
Yes they were good
Who's outfit did you like?
Zendaya looked amazing.
She did I loved her hair and that green dress was so cute.
I liked how it was covering and went all the way down to her ankles, but was still sheer and hot
And the plunging neckline, loved it
I also love Allison Williams sequined dress
Oh yea, I really liked that one too, and it wasn't too revealing either.
I think Allison Williams was my favorite, that dress was so beautiful.
My favorite was Zendaya and her green dress.
Did you see the leather jacket and red joggers?
Yes that was not cute at all
No it shouldn't have been worn to an awards show.
Sometimes people express themselves too much when it comes to clothes
And there was the girl wearing that plain white dress and white cowboy boots.
That was too plain. There is a fine line between too much and not enough
Exactly. I hated that all white dress.
It was not worthy of an awards show either.
No it wasn't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see any of the gowns from the Golden Globes?
Yes, I thought Nicole Kidman looked amazing.
I agree, she always makes great fashion choices.
She does!
With a figure like hers, it's hard to go wrong.
Did you see Julia Louis-Dreyfuss's dress?
Yes, I thought it was kind of bland.
Yes, she's not usually one to take chances.
Yes, speaking of taking chances, did you see Halle Berry?
Yes, I thought that was a little over the top. Too much skin showing.
Yes, but again, if you have that kind of figure, it doesn't look terrible.
Yes, I just didn't think it was very tasteful.
I agree, but I really do like that blush color that is becoming so popular.
Yes, I find that flattering on most skin tones.
Unless you are really pale.
Yes, then I think it could leave you looking washed out.
Yes, also that forest green seemed popular again this year.
Yes, I notice two or three people dressing in an emerald green of some sort.
Yes, I think that can also be a flattering color on most.
Yes, especially if you have dark features I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think will be the big hit for this summer as far as clothes?
For Men or Women?
I guess for men
I dont know hopefully not cut off denim shorts again
I dont know this seems like its trending everywhere
I dont get it, dont people call them "jorts?"
Yeah, but hipsters love irony
They do, but they cant keep it up
What do they do with their jeans
Buy new ones each year.
How about for women?
I don't know I am not an aficiondao
Well every year its something new
Could be sun dresses again
Maybe, but I feel like that was overdone
Nah, they can hide their bodies
Dont do that! I think its a mistake
People want to feel comfortable in the heat
Speaking of, does every guy wear the same Ray Ban sunglasses?
Seems like it if you lived on Instagram
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever find yourself wearing the same thing celebrities wear?
I don't really have the money to keep up with their lifestyles
I'm not looking at the lifestyles and talking specifically about what they wear
I gotcha yeah I try to wear what they have but I don't think that they are trendsetters
Wow that's crazy I think they know what they're doing
What do you think is the best magazine for fashion
I would probably say Vogue
I would probably say Vogue
I'm not a big fan of that publication to be honest with you
I'm not a big fan of that publication to be honest with you
They do post a lot of different styles which I like to get inspiration from
What would you rather wear clothes the celebrity endorsers or nothing at all
To be honest with you I choose my own fashion I don't need a celebrity tell me what to wear
Ouch it seems like you're throwing shade
No I'm not doing that I'm just saying I think each individual has their own likes and dislikes
But you do need some sort of direction to head in
Not necessarily you can go online and get a lot of ideas for a wardrobe
What sites do you use for that
I think Pinterest does a good job
Yeah I'm not a fan of that at all
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of shoes would you wear with this dress?
Probably silver or white flats or a low heel.
Maybe my silver ones with the straps?
That would be fine, or you could borrow my white ones.
I don't know which I like more.
I'd say the siler ones but it's up to you.
OK. I'll wear those then.
Also wear that pretty watermelon tourmaline necklace with it.
That's a great idea.
It looks good on you too and will match perfectly.
You always know so much about fashion. You have a great style.
Thanks. I just wear what I like.
How about these earrings?
They look nice with it.
I love these. I got them at Walmart believe it or not.
Walmart has great jewelry and it's pretty cheap.
I don't shop there often but I have noticed that too.
I have a few pieces from there. That blue necklace you like came from there.
Maybe I'll see if they have more of those so I can get one.
They had it in pink too. I'll help you find them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new jewelry I made?
Yes. It's great.
I am selling it now.
Are you making money at it?
Not much but it's a hobby I really enjoy?
Where do you get all those pretty charms and stuff?
Fire Mountain is one place.
I'll have to check that out.
They have a website.
Do you enjoy making jewelry?
I really do.
That's great.
I especially like doing necklaces with chai links.
Those are great. I love this one you made today.
Thanks. Those take a lot of time but are fun to do.
Could you teach me to do it?
Sure. Let's start now.
What do you need?
The rings and clasps.
Thanks. I will get some.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess what may be back in fashion this spring and summer, Sue.
I don't know.
It's a trend of the eighties that no one really fought to keep.
Which one is that? There were so many back then.
Shoulder pads. They are back in style.
Shoulder pads. Give me a break.
I'm serious but these are the boxy long kind.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
Look at this article in the Cosmopolitan. See for yourself.
The boxy shapes seen on the Balenciaga catwalk are likely to be too extreme for us mere muggles but more relaxed shapes at Chanel and Marni gave an insight into how we could take on the trend, too.
What did I tell you?
Just because some fashion designer had models walking the catwalk with these huge, boxy shoulders, that does not mean that is what is in.
You never know.
Look at the part about the sheer fabrics. Who is going to walk around in public with sheer pants on?
Won't be me.
Me neither.
I think these designers are just throwing things up in the air and waiting to see which one catches on.
You think?
I do would love to have that boxy shoulder jacket in the picture.
If I saw you walking down the street dressed like that, I would go the other way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the best dressed James Bond?
Wow, that's a tough one.  However, I would go with Thunderball the midnight blue dinner jacket he wore was a very classic look.
Fine, any other favorite Bond outfits?
In Skyfall Daniel Craig wore a shawl collar jacket that while stylish worked well with the darker tones of the movie.
There have also been some pretty badly dressed characters in the movies though.
Yes indeed, at least every film set in warm weather seems to feature someone with a mismatched tropical outfit of some kind.
Bond sure has evolved his style over the years.
It's been interesting he's worn everything from ivory jackets to tweed.
I feel like a lot of men like to sometimes copy his style don't you think?
Definitely would agree with that, many of my friends have worn a peacoat or in the summer tried the shorter swim trunks popular after Casino Royale.
I must say some of the villains have had some interesting style choices as well.
Hugo Drax in moonraker had an intresting style with the all caramel colored jacket.
Fashion usually says a lot about the villains, I usually can tell what their motives are by their outfit.
Not necessarily true, a lot of them of been disguised in everything from spacesuits to old 1940's ear maid outfits.
What would you tell someone who wanted to copy just a single item form Bond's style?
The black tuxedo in any cut that's modern really goes a long way.
Bond also often wears a bow tie and not a tie I always wondered why not a tie?
Probably because the tie would clash with the outfit a lot and the bow tie is a subtle and unique fashion statement.
I also really like the outfits the ladies of Bond wear which one is your favorite?
The original bond girl of course! Ursula Andress, and her white bikini she looks beautiful!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was watching a catwalk, and some of them were rubbish.
Was it in USA/?
nO IT WAS IN PARIS.
What kind of dresses were they?
They were like short women dresses, and selection was haphazard.
Actually, fashion can not be generalized.
what do you mean?
Everyone is different, and people prefer and choose according to their job or occasion.
What is your favorites?
I long evening gowns.
They are very reasonable in some stores.
Is there any in jcpenney?
May be, but I saw some on online. very pretty. You can check it out.
I actually prefer with embroidery and colorful.
You should check online for sure, specially from china.
I do not trust so much as sometime chinese material are not good.
Yes, that is the negeative point about online.
I am thinking to get some in this week.
You should buy from top rated business.
good idea
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the list of The Best and Worst Dressed at the People's Choice Awards 2017?
I haven't seen the list, but I did see the show. Who were the best dressed?
Jennifer Lopez, Yara Shahidi and Priyanka Chopra were among them. They all looked modern, and very gorgeous.
Oh, yeah! Jennifer Lopez was wearing a gown with an embellished illusion bodice. She looked breathtaking.
Priyanka Chopra looked comfortable yet stylish wearing that peach, fringed dress.
Yeah, it looked really good on her. I bet it would look bad if I wore that.
The Disney star was on the list, too... I can't recall her name. She wore a blush cocktail dress with floral things attached to it...
Oh, the short dress with the black floral sequin-like things? I think you mean Peyton List.
Did you see what Ruby Rose was wearing?
The matching orange suit and pants?
Haha, yes! That's what. With of course, a low-cut, an matching heels.
She looked like  a prisoner. I think that was the goal.
One of the worst dressed were Gwen Stefani.
Oh, yeah. Yikes! What was that? It looked like a curtain threw up on her...
It's apparently a clown-inspired ruffled blue dress with a cut-out panel on the tummy.
And that's not all, she even wore fishnet tights. Talk about topping the list of the worst.
Jodie Sweetin's on the list, too, but I beg to differ. I think she looked amazing!
Yeah, I agree. I guess it's just quite unorthodox to wear a floral ball gown with a leather jacket.
And, of course, Chris Sullivan definitely made heads turn and eyes bulge out of their sockets with his look.
My eyes hurt to look at his pants... paint-splattered pants... I hope he chooses better next year! If he's still invited, that is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love going to Claire's.
Me too. I'm going today.
What do you buy there?
I love the headbands and earrings.
They have a great deal with now where you get three items when you buy three.
That's great. I'll take advantage of that.
I got cute earrings last time with cupcakes on them.
I got turtle ones myself.
Those sound cute.
They were blue and green turtles.
The cupcakes were silver and pink.
Did you get those earrings you're wearing now there?
No, those came from a thrift store. They're Celtic knots.
They're really nice. They go great with your outfit.
I like silger. It matches everything I think.
I agree about that.
I wear more silver than gold.
I like both but you're right about silver matching.
Gold dos too.
I suppose but I prefer silver a tiny bit I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the 2017 Oscars best dresses?
Yes I really think Emma Stone was the best!
What? I totally though Scarlet Johansan's dress was perfect fit her perfectly!
No way Emma's beaded golden 20's style gown was amazing.
Well Scarlet's was way more unique!
How so? Didn't really look like it belonged at the Oscars if you ask me.
What do you mean by that?
The dress looked way to casual and the style was dull!
Yeah well Emma's was  not unique at all.
How's that?
Just a copy of a millon dresses from the 20s.
I don't know about that.
It totally was just look up dresses from the 20s you'll see what I mean.
Either way I still think Emma looked classy.
I also think her shoes were ugly.
I didn't much like the shoes either.
They were too plain and similar to her dress.
Yeah I agree. I gotta say though I think Leslie Man's dress was a total disater.
Yes! It was so gaudy and looked like mustard.
Yeah like a bad prom dress from the 80s.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love watching women's beautiful dresses on any red carpet.
Yes, most of the women wear beautiful gowns.
Though some of them seem like they came from another planet, or they were still living in the 40's.
Yes, I think Hillary Swank was one of the worst dressed during Oscars 2016.
Did you see Jessica Alba wore this glittering gold Versace gown to the 78th Annual Academy Awards of, in think, 2006.
Yes, I loved her fawn or beige like long dress.
She was wearing the halter neck, the open back and the flower details make this look sophisticated.
She was looking sexy.
What about Jessica Chastain?  She looked exquisite at the 84th Annual Academy Awards.
I remember she was wearing strapless Alexander McQueen gown with $2 million worth of Harry Winston jewelry.
Her dress was black and gold, I think??
Yes, it was.  I remember she even made into the best-dressed lists.
What about Gwyneth Paltrow?  I really like her sense of dress.
I love her acting and her style.  She wears clothes, whether fashionable or not, with grace and dignity.  Don't you think?
Taraji Hanson was looking very nice in black figure hugging long dress.
Yes, I loved her necklace which went so well with her dress.
Talking 2017 Oscars I think Jessica Biel also looked nice.
Yes.  I loved her figure hugging golden dress.
What do you think of the always stylish Emma Stone's Tiffany & Co. jewels and a gold Givenchy Haute Couture gown?
I think it was overrated.  I didn't like the laying of her long dress, though media raved about how it matched the oscar statuette.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Taylor Swift's dress at the Grammy's?
Yes, she looked absolutely stunning.
I'm trying to remember the name of the designer but it has slipped my mind.
I think her name is Versace.
Right, yes, that's it!
She has such a great eye for fashion, doesn't she?
Yeah, the way she created the dress with big and bold blocks of color was so unique.
I agree, it's simple yet dramatic at the same time.
Yep, I love when designers play with color for their red carpet dresses like she does.
True, but Adele looked amazing too, and her's was just a long black dress.
Sometimes the simple classic styles can be the most beautiful, can't they?
Yes!  Although the complex beading on her dress made it much more unique and sophisticated than your average black dress.
True, but then you have people like Lady Gaga in her extremely bold Mark Jacob's outfit who really steal the show when it comes to fashion.
I must have missed that, what did it look like?
It was an almost electric blue dress, with a suit-like structure.
Oh, that's right, and she had on those huge crimson heels!
Yep, she definitely had the most unique outfit of anyone.
Lady Gaga is always wearing the most unique fashion of anyone!
I really can't argue with that!
Her fashion sense is just too bold to be contained.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I love your shoes. Where did you get them?
I got these from Ross.
How much did they cost?
I believe I paid less than 20 dollars for them.
That's a great deal. Do you always get your shoes from Ross?
No, I just saw that these were on sale, so I took advantage.
Where do you buy your shoes from?
I really love this online store called "Just Fab." They have great deals.
What type of shoes do they have?
They have all kinds, but they definitely have a great selection for heels.
I'm looking for some that have straps that go up to my knee. Do you think they have some?
Yes, I'm sure they do. I just purchased some thigh high boots from them last week.
How much did you pay for those?
I got a great deal, two for 35 dollars.
What kind did you get?
I got the thigh high boots, and I got some clear pumps to go with my all white dress that I also purchased from them.
Clear pumps with a white dress, that sounds like it would look great together.
Yeah, the white dress comes to my knees, and its tight fitting, I love it.
Did you get that from Just Fab too?
Yes, their dresses are just as great as their shoes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It looks like all the clothes are going to have holes in them again this summer.
Oh you mean all the eyelet. There's eyelet every summer.
Yes and I hate it. I always think people are evaluating my underwear.
It's meant to be cooling. In fact it is cooling.
Not if you wear a camisole and slip underneath, it's not.
So don't.
Pardon me if I'm shy.
Marcie, nobody wants to see our stuff, we're old. Besides, everybody else will be in shorts and crop tops.
That's true, Elise. Don't mind me.
Get yourself a nice eyelet blouse, and let the breezes blow.
Hmm. Maybe a little eyelet around the top or bottom. Just to be airy.
That's the spirit. Summer is for breezy fashions.
Okay. Come shopping with me?
What do you mean? You're supposed to shop from your computer.
Oh. I never have.
It's great. Your big airy bedroom is your dressing room, and they usually pay for shippping whatever you return.
Really?
Really. It's the greatest fashion advance since eyelet.
Maybe I'll try it.
Do that. It's so cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I see you're wearing Gymshark's women's workout leggings and gym tights, Jan.
Yep. They came in the mail yesterday.
Just in time for today's workout.
Exactly.
How do they fit?
They fit really well on me. I did some lunges, squats and dead lifts and they held up.
I've been thinking about ordering myself a pair.
You should. They are worth every penny.
Which one are those?
They are the Neon Tropical Legging.
Do have a hidden pocket?
Yeah. It's concealed along the waistband.
I think I will order a pair when I get home.
You won't regret ordering them. These figure sculpting and high waisted, are very supportive.
They look like they are pretty comfortable.
You wouldn't believe how comfortable they are.
I'm not fan of the color though. I would have to pick something less loud.
You know they have a selection of colors.
I think I will get the blueberry marl colored ones.
Those are so cute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think has been the most outrageous fashion statement in popular culture?
Lady Gaga's meat dress was pretty ridiculous.
True, but she was trying too hard with that one.
Remember J-Lo's double sided tape dress holding up her boobs in the late 90s?
Yeah, funny how people made a big deal of it at the time.
Same with Madonna and her cone-shaped bra back in the day.
It seems like you don't see as many fashion statements by men that resonate so deeply with the public.
Well, Dennis Rodman sort of did in his time.
Sure, but part of it was dressing up in women's clothes, like the wedding dress publicity stunt.
Justin Bieber started a trend of wearing pants that looked like they had a diaper in them, right?
Don't remind me.
What are some fashion trends that you can't stand right now?
Skinny jeans - I'm all for clothes that have a tailored fit, but some of those jeans are too tight.
Sure, but depending on the person wearing them, they can be attractive.
True, but not the general wearer.
Another one for me is torn pants. It seems like they come and go, but never look good.
There are some things that you should only wear if you are a performer, I suppose.
I've never been a fan of v-neck sweaters.
Agreed, there is something strange about them. Maybe if you wear a tie underneath them.
I suppose that could be okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where did you get those shades?
Well I actually just found them at a gas station but they fit my face so well.
I know they go perfectly with your cheek bones. Plus the shades aren't too dark.
Wow so how did you get those to match?
Well I found two fabrics with the same style and made it into this skirt.
Wow did you do the pleading yourself?
Hes your would be surprised how difficult it is. I had to look in so many fashion magazines to get an idea.
Well that is intense, how did you come across the fabric?
Well it was at a fashion school
Was it used or were you able to find it for free? I thought there was no free in fashion
well that is true and not true. The black doesn't really match the grey.
Does the pattern match the solid?
Well it may but you will need to find some matching shoes and accessories
I was think of wearing this watch, I know it makes a statement but what do you think?
It's sort of beautiful but has too big of a face for my taste
What about these shoes, will they go with the rest of the outfit?
They may but I am not sure, why don't you try it on?
Okay it just I don't think it fits. I will need to get it himmed
Well can we go to a seamstress?
I don't know one in this area but we could always call the fashion police. LOL
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who did you think was the best dressed at the 2017 Grammy's red carpet ?
Well I really liked the golden outfit that Cee Lo Green had on.
I noticed that Solange Knowles also was wearing gold.
Yeah there were a few celebrities that wore gold this year but which golden dressed celebrity was your favorite ?
I really liked the golden top that Katy Perry wore on the red carpet.
Yeah that was really tight on her body but who was your favorite dress male at the Grammys ?
Definitely James Corden with his silky jacket and did you see who he was standing with ?
Yes Julia Carey in that golden, form fitting mini dress she looked gorgeous as well.
I really liked the dress that Kat Graham wore with he different striped colors.
You know who really looked cool though ?
Who are you talking about ?
Nick Jonas with his black metal studded outfit I thought it was very stylish.
I though Halsey was even more fashionable with her bare breast nearly hanging out in that blue silk outfit.
What it a blue silk dress ?
No it was a silk blouse and silk pants with the blouse unbuttoned and her breast nearly hanging out.
Yeah that was really provocative.
What did you think of Mya's red silk pant suit ?
I thought it was gorgeous but really safe I think she could have pushed the limits more.
What did you think about Camila Cabello in her gray satin style dress ?
I thought she looked adorable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see what Kimmy was wearing?
Yes, I can't believe so put that shirt with those biker shorts.
Exactly, her pink tunic with her silver jewelry would of been a better combination.
Her pink shirt, it's has too many ruffles. Ruffles are so ugly.
Hey I wear shirts with ruffles.  You said you liked them
Your tall, you can pull off ruffles unlike Kimmy whose short.
I guess that's true
Did you see my new shoes.  They are black heels
Are they leather
It's fake leather and they have 3 inch heel. I'm wearing
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ooh, I like your blouse. It's so soft and flowy. And that color is gorgeous on you.
Thank you. The blouse is polyester, and the color is Millennial pink.
Millennial pink? I think I've heard of that. But we're hardly Millenials, dear.
Anyone can wear it, darling. Even you.
Thanks, I guess. But it's not really a pink-y pink, is it? It's almost a beige.
But not quite. For your information, there are a whole range of Millennial pinks.
From sugar sweet to sticky?
No, none  of them is sticky. And each is sweet in its own way.
Like you. Why is it called Milennial?
Supposedly because the Millennials, those rising young twerps, prefer this pink to all other shades.
All others. Why?
Because, my dear, it's all their own. Also it's grown-up, assertive, and unafraid of its own nature.
This color is unafraid?
Well, perhaps those who wear it are. Or perhaps the color itself inspires audacity.
But you, sweetheart, are no Millennial. Why are you  wearing this subtle but engaging color?
To show I know that's-what by keeping up with the times. In short, to be in fashion.
Being in fashion shows you know what's what?
Yep. how else could I demonstrate that to a total stranger?
Amazing. What a woman you are.
Yes I am. But I think this pink is fading. I'm going to get you a beautiful green tie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love that girl's dress.
I made one like that once.
I can't believe you can make clothes.
I have to practice for a long time to get good at it.
I'll bet. I wish I could do it.
I could show you. We could make you a dress like hers.
I'd love that. Should we go get materials today?
Sure. Let's go to the craft store.
I'd like it in a soft pink or maybe a light lavender color.
That would be pretty. You have good taste.
Thanks. I'd also like some lace on it. Do they sell lace?
They have lace, yes.
This is going to be so much fun.
Making a dress is kind of tricky. I hope you know that.
I do. I'll help as much as I can though.
I know. It will be fun but ot super easy for you on your first time.
I don't expect it to be. I hope some day I can do it myself.
You'll get there.
Making my own clothes has always been a dream of mine.
I'm glad I can help you do it then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best dressed actor in Hollwood?
Does it matter? Men wear the same thing.
Yeah but some guys dress like theyre poor
True, I guess I would say George Clooney.
I dont know if I could say that anymore, how about Ryan Gosseling?
Again I guess it all goes back to men wearing the same thing all the time.
OK turn to women then.
Hmm....Maybe Emma Stone?
I dont know that much about what she wears
She keeps it plain and normal, nothing too extravagant
You mean like Lady Gaga?
Sometimes I think she does it on purpose.
She is trying to look too much like Madonna did.
Yeah some of the outfits, I dont get it.
Kendall Jenner dresses nice.
Well shes a model so she has to wear all those weird outfits.
Does anyone actually buy them?
I think for the unique factor, yes.
Where do you start when designing those clothes?
I dont know I guess the trash can then you go from there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think are some new fashion trends this spring?
I think rompers and bright paisley patterns are in style this season!
I have just the perfect paisley dress sitting in my closet. What about skirts?
Maxi skirts, especially in dark colors, are all the rage!
What should I pair a maxi skirt with?
For the best look, a maxi skirt should be paired with a shorter, well-fitting top.
Which style of shoes are in this season? I love my Louboutins to death!
Stilettos will always be popular. But chunky heels are making a come back.
Thank goodness! What about accessories? I've got this lovely gold chain.
Gold chains aren't as popular, but chokers are. Usually they're made out of plastic or leather.
I've never worn a choker before. I'll have to go buy one!
I own a few chokers. They're all beautiful. Now onto bags!
Yes! I love purses of any and every kind. What's couture this season?
This year, big, oversized bags are all the rage!
Thank god, I have so much stuff to carry with me I usually end up using a tote anyway!
Yep. Now let's talk about the backbone of a wardrobe: jeans.
Are skinny jeans still in style?
They always are. This season we recommend a high-waisted, dark wash jean.
What about tops?
Some popular tops are crop tops and the classic white tee.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Jennifer Lopez's dress at the Met Gala?
Yes, I thought it looked familiar.
Yes, it looked like something she had worn to the Oscars I thought.
It was fabulous though.
Yes, I really like that aquamarine color on her.
Yes, me too.
That color is flattering to a lot of different skin types.
Yes, unless you are super pale!
Yes, I agree.
I could not wear that color.
Yes, I think fair skin looks best in bolder colors.
Yes, otherwise we tend to look washed out.
Her boyfriend was wearing a really nice suit with a tie that matched her dress.
I noticed that, very sharp.
Diana Ross had on a really beautiful Oscar de la Renta gown too.
I did not see that. What did it look like.
It was super poofy and full of volume.
Sounds like Diana Ross.
Yes, it was dramatic and beautiful.
Just like her!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need help choosing a dress for the wedding next weekend. Can you go shopping with me on Friday?
Yeah, sure! I love shopping for dresses! What time do you want to go?
Around five. I'll pick you up.
Sounds great! So, are you thinking about using a long dress or short dress?
Well, I'm not quite sure but I think a long dress will look more elegant, considering the occasion. Don't you think?
True. Long dresses do look more elegant but a short dress will draw more attention from the single bachelors!
Oh yeah! I didn't think about that! Maybe I should buy a short dress instead.
Do you have a nice high heel pair of shoes?
Uhm, I have a pair of shoes with heels but they're not very high.
Oh no, you'd better pick me up at three. We're going to have to go shoe shopping too!
But I wasn't planning on buying shoes too!
You cannot wear a short sexy dress with low heels! Short dresses draw attention to your legs!
This wedding invitation is becoming expensive. Maybe I just won't go...
No, no, no. Relax! I know a great store for dresses that always has good sales.
Don't you have a dress or a pair of shoes I can borrow? You go out a lot.
Actually, yeah, I do! Now that I think about it, I have the perfect dress for you!
What color is it?
It's a sassy red! It'll look great on you!
Are you sure? Sassy red? That sounds a bit extravagant for me, don't you think?
Don't worry. Leave it to me. Come on over tonight after work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you think will be on the Met Gala worst dressed list
I am definitely putting my vote in for Solange and her dress coat
The designer of her dress was Calvin Klein
I think the dress is a miss this year.
Although I somewhat admire her fashion bravery
She does take a stand, especially with this black Patent leather dress.
I also have to say that Jennifer Lopez' dress did not live up to expectation
I kind of agree but the color of the Oscar De Larenta dress was beautiful
I just thought the cut of the dress was unflattering
I like the fullness of it and how it fluttered in the wind
It was refreshing to see her go in opposite direction of what she typical wears
I loved the Moroccan inspired vibe it gave.
With her hair in that high pony tail and the dress it seemed like she was a genie.
Her jewelry was just right.
On the other hand I really loved Zendayas Marchesa gown.
The floral pattern was gorgeous.
Especially against the red bright red silk background
The background really made the dress pop
The fullness of the dress, without any slits was so chic.
She really has a chic, edgy way with fashion
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Sheryl have you seen my new Dooney & Bourke  hand bag?
New one?
The one I am holding.
Girl, that is cute. What is the name of it?
It's the Dooney & Bourke Patent Leather Trina Satchel.
That is such a pretty shade of yellow.
Isn't it? They call this shade dandelion.
What other colors does it come in?
Black, key lime and white.
Are all of the colors glossy like yours.
You know it.
I like the tassel on it. It makes the bag look fun.
I bought the dandelion color to wear with my spring outfits.
I'm not a big purse fan as I lean more towards cross body bags. They are easy and convenient.
Then this one would be a good one for you, too.   It is the perfect size, easy access -not too deep, not too wide.
I just love their bags but I hate their prices.
Dooney & Bourke can be and are usually pricey.
They are expensive.
But that bag is to die for. I may get me one.
I think every woman should  own at least one designer handbag in her lifetime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see what she was wearing yesterday?
Yeah, it was really tacky, who wears a skirt with shoes like those?
I know, I would never in a million years expect her to wear something like that.
I think she believes she is setting some type of trend.
It is only a trend if others think it looks good or it starts to become popular.
Yeah, It at least as to have something that pops.
I know, her stuff was just all over the place.  Nothing matched and it just didn't make sense.
Yeah, I was really confused, I thought she was wearing an outfit for a play or something, I didn't realize it was suppose to be an every outfit.
Maybe we should go up and ask her what she was thinking?
No that would be really rude.
I don't mean just coming out and asking, I mean like saying hey I like your shoes and skirt and see what she says.
You mean like hoping she will talk about why she was wearing that combination or something like that?
Yeah, plus it will be an ice breaker and maybe we can ask her about it more.
Yeah good point, maybe she will explain why she was wearing it and then it would make sense.
Yeah, plus I liked her shoes.  I think they were Lou Vitton's.
Yeah they were nice, just not with that skirt.
I mean her clothes are generally really pretty, but the hot pink and dark green combo, just do not work.
Yeah, I think the color choice was extremely poor taste.
Maybe if the skirt was a bluish color it would have brought them all together?
Yeah, but I also think the shoes should have been a neutral or bright color, instead of the dark color.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard eighties fashion is making a come back for the summer in 2017.
Really? I have to go check out some vintage clothing stores.
Exactly, ruffle skirts with wide buckle belts are a must to have for your closet, the Carrie Bradshaw look.
Another must is those wide power shoulder blouses, I think my mom has some thrown way back in her closet somewhere.
Bralettes too, which can be worn by themselves or with some sheer sparkly tops, the way MaDonna use too.
French bikinis are sure to bring attention at the beach as well, the ones with stripes and bright colors.
Yes, bright colors, sparkles, the more bling, the better this summer.
I remember Tom Cruise in Top Gun with those wayfarers which will definitely be a beach accessory.
I am a sucker for the eighties hair bands too, I love the spandex and larger than life hair.
the bigger the hair the better, and off the shoulder crop tops, mini skirt and thigh high boots.
The vintage concert shirts will certainly be a blast from the past.
I bet we could go on ebay and find some of those vintage concert t-shirts.
I bet we could, or the demnim jackets with all the concert buttons on them so retro chic.
The leather studded pants and jackets will definitely be a hit with the big leather studded hobo bags.
We will have to go find some desinger eighties inspired handbags as well.
Kate Spades new small striped Maya tote is influenced by the love of stripes in the eighties.
I know I love Michael Kors Saffiano black/metallic stud large tote bag, very eighties inspired.
Michael Kors was heavily inspired by Valentino and his Astor Uptown shoulder tote shows the flair of the eighties with the rivets.
I can't wait to look like Julia Roberts from Pretty Women in my spandex dress and thigh high boots and rock the eighties.
I prefer to look like Julia Roberts from Pretty Women in the red flowing silk gown and show my eighties elagance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could have only one outfit, what would it be?
What do you mean?
I mean if you threw out all your clothes, but could only keep one outfit, what would you keep?
Ahh, right. That's a challenge. I need a moment to think about it.
No problem. For me, though, I think I'd keep my shirt, jeans, and also one coat.
Which coat?
Probably my trench coat. I think I can get away with wearing that in any weather.
Ahhh, right. Outerwear is often more flexible.
For shoes, I think I'd have to pick boots. You can also wear those in any weather.
But is it really a good idea to walk around in boots all the time?
No. But you CAN walk around in boots all the time. That's the point.
Ahh right. For me, I'd probably choose this shirt, jeans, and a coat.
What coat?
Well, probably a peacoat.
But wouldn't you get hot?
Huh? I don't have to wear the this outfit all the time, do I?
Ahhh, you're right. You don't.
For shoes, I feel like normal tennis shoes are pretty flexible.
Really?
Yeah, I wear those during the winter even. They're great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the best dressed in the MTV Movie Awards this year?
I'm not quite sure there are alot of options! I liked Mary Eizabeth Winstead's denim dress
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't like the way younger people dress these days?
Why do you say that?
I think they are immodest and show too much skin.
Do you really think they're that different than the previous generation?
They probably are only slightly more immodest in the way they dress than the previous generation,
I think the previous generation showed just as much skin. Our culture is constantly pushing us to dress sexy.
That's true. Teens are taught to glamorize the way celebrities dress without realizing that the average person dressing that way could be harassed or get into trouble.
I don't think all current fashion is bad. I really like the uneven hemline trend in tops, dresses and skirts.
I do too. And I think the cold shoulder trend is cute without being overly sexy or exposing too much skin.
I never thought skinny jeans would come back into style! They're unflattering and uncomfortable for most people.
A different trand that I dislike is the trend of wearing sweats, scrubs, yoga pant, leggings or even pajamas constantly. A lot of people don't take any effort to make themselves look nice.
I sort of agree. We should take pride in our appearance, but overall we need to focus less on appearance and more on the content of the character of the person.
You know what trend I think is funny? In ads for men's clothes, they're starting to make the men pose in more and more ridiculous ways, the way they do women.
It is funny to see a guy advertising a suit, standing in the rain with an unopened umbrella, or laying on the floor in a warehouse.
But the same pressure women have felt to be as thin as fashion models is also starting to effect men, they think they're supposed to look like fashion models.
People don't understand that fashion advertisements use a lot of tricks: camera angles, photoshop, lighting, makeup, all just to get the perfect shot.
It's unfair that now they photoshop almost every fashion model's picture or celebrities' pictures. They take attractive people and impose impossible standards on them like tiny waists.
I'd like to see a more healthy look in fashion advertising. It would be nice to see models that aren't so impossibly perfect and unrelateable.
I know, I really like the trend of using plus sized models.
EVen though plus sized is really just the size of the average American woman! It should be called real sized.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you tried any of the fashion subscription services?
What do you mean?
I subscribe to a fashion subscription service and they send me clothes to wear every month.
What have they sent you?
This month I got two of the most beautiful black leggings.
That's so cool! Did they fit well?
Yes, they did. One pair had leather on the front so they are gorgeous for daytime or night.
I love the sound of those.
I also got the best sweater from French Connection.
I love the way French Connection fits. They cut their clothes beautifully.
I know. The one I have is grey and the sleeves are striped black and white.
Oh, so they go perfectly with the black legging you have?
Yes, they do. I actually wore them with the leggings with the leather fronts and a black jacket.
I bet that looked awesome.
It did, and it was very comfortable too.
I used to have the most beautiful sweater from French connection.
What did it look like?
It was blue and soft and has an owl wearing glasses on the front.
I think I know which one you mean. It was fitted?
Yes, I loved it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So why do you think all these retailers are failing?
Fashion is different these days
Dont you think its all cyclical?
Sure but theres a point where people will not pay X when they cant get it for Y
So what are you saying
Brands like Abercrombie who market higher end items are not going to keep up with other retailers
Who do you think is their main competition?
I would say H&M
They make alot of products
They do and they make them affordable for everyone
So does Abercrombie need to change their model?
No because they cant afford to sell items at the price point H&M does.
So you think we see them stop creating fashion?
In a sense, yes.
You can get the same clothes from H&M?
Not the same quality. They wont last as long
But they look the same, just need to replace them more often?
Yes but most of the clothes end up only lasting a season anyway before the next trend comes out.
I get where you are going
Yeah so as long as they keep up selling how they do, theyll meet their end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow, did you see what Jenna was wearing this morning?
I did! I can't believe she would wear that! I think I was 2 the last time I put on overalls...
I'm surprised you ever wore overalls at all, actually.
I did, my mom even has a picture of me wearing them.. ugh.
Haha, I've got to see that! But still, I bet you wore them better than Jenna did.
Yeah, my diaper really filled out the tush! Haha.
Better than no tush! I wish I had more of a back end, I don't look good in most jeans because I need to tone up.
Oh, I don't know, I think the jeans you're wearing now are fine.
Well, they're better than Jenna's overalls. Maybe we should say something to her?
Like what? She's just going to get mad if we try to act like the hosts on "What not to wear"...
I don't know, she might be grateful. Who knows, maybe this is the begining of a career in fashon!
No way, I have style, but I could never make it as a designer.
Honey, if you can pull off overalls, you can be a fashon guru. Just go talk to her! She needs your advice!
Well, maybe after lunch I could grab some magazines and look through them with her. Point out some nice new trends...
That's the spirit! I just hate to see fashon disasters walking around.. in overalls...
Haha, yeah me too, I guess it would be doing the world a favor.
Totally, not to mention you would be doing Jenna a huge favor!
Yeah, I suppose you're right. I'll give it a try.
I can go with you too, I've been meaning to ask her if she wants to go shopping this weekend for some new tops.
Oh, that would be perfect, we can all go and help her out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of fashion are you into?
I'm into minimalist fashion.
Oh, what's that?
You just own a couple pieces of clothing and make a lot of outfits.
Oh that's cool. How small is your closet then?
It's normal size, just not very full. I have like 5 shirts, 2 pairs of pants, and 2 pairs of shoes.
I could try minimalist for a while, but I really like owning a lot of clothes.
Yeah that's cool. What kind of fashion do you like?
I like avant garde fashion. No rules!
What is the heck is that?
It's like the frontier of something. I like to explore and be adventerous.
So what do you wear?
I try to break norms with my fashion, mismatch and try new things.
What else do you do for that?
I make a lot of my own clothes or alter my old ones.
Like cut them up or sew stuff on them?
Exactly, that's very avant garde!
Who are your favorite designers?
I like Alexander Mcqueen pretty much.
I"ve never heard of him but I'll look him up later!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need to dress business casual for work tomorrow. I'm not sure what that means.
Business casual definitely means different things in different places.
I don't want to wear jeans. Even if they're nice I don't think they're dressy enough.
I agree. What about slacks or some relaxed trousers?
I have a beautiful pair of navy blue trousers.
What about a top that is made out of a nice fabric?
I'm not sure. What fabrics are you thinking of?
Well, I think cashmere and jersey are inherently classier. Don't you think?
I agree. I have some solid short sleeve cashmere sweater tops.
What colors?
Well, I have a dark grey, a black and a brown.
I think that dark grey would be the best color to wear with navy blue pants.
I do too. I love that color combination.
What about a jacket?
I'm going to wear a blazer.
Ok, will you wear jewelry?
Yes, I'm going to wear something classic like pearls or diamond studs.
Classic is always a good choice!
True, but I may actually go with jewelry that makes a bit more of a statement since its casual Friday.
I would go with a statement necklace.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need to buy some new jeans, but I'm not sure which style to get.
Try on some boyfriend jeans and some skinny jeans. Those are two great styles.
I know, but I haven't been finding jeans that are cut well lately. What brands do you like?
Levis makes a great pair of boyfriend jeans. They are relaxed fit but not so baggy that they're sloppy looking.
Great, I think I'll try to find a low cut pair. Maybe something destroyed in a medium wash.
I bet they'll look great on you. Grab a statement tshirt and some aviators and your outfit is set.
I think I'm going to buy some RayBans. I love the look of them.
I have some they're the coolest glasses and very high quality.
I want to style my jeans with an oversize button down shirt.
A chambray button down shirt would look so cool.
Or even a casual white v neck tshirt.
Plain white is great and if you want something bolder slogan Tshirts are big this season.
I saw that. I saw some feminist slogan Tshirts that were very cool from Christian Dior and Stella McCartney.
I like to wear a statement t like that tucked with a maxi skirt.
I like that. That look is very edgy.
I do it sometimes with a ball skirt as well.
That would look great with a leather jacket over it for evening.
Yes, or a jean jacket for earlier in the day if it's cool out.
I can't wait until it's warm and we can wear all the spring trends.
Yes, and pair them with our classic pieces.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Victoria Beckham's new line at Target.
Yes, but I don't like it.
Why I think her line is cute and affordable.
To me it looks cheap and it doesn't look like she put much thought into the line.
Who is your favorite desinger
I love Tom Ford, but I can't afford his clothes.
Yeah, Tom Ford is ok, Jay-Z seems to love him, but I'm not into Tom Ford's clothes.
He make nice things, I also love Micheal Kors, I love his bags!
Who dresses better Rhianna or Beyonce?
Rhianna, because she takes more risks. She changes up her style all the time. Beyonce is hit or miss for me.
Who is your style Icon?
I like the way Michelle Obama dressed. She become my icon of the years she has so much style and class and she has nice skin to go with her outfits.
Do you shop at H&M?
Sometimes, but I am not crazy about their fashion, I actually like shopping at True Religion.
True Religion, jeans are not worth it in my opinion.
Why, I love their clothes True Religion is a cult fave!
DO you watch fashion shows? Does Project Runway still come on? Of love Tim Gunn!
I'm not sure, I do not watch fashion shows.
What are you wearing now, where did you get your outfit from?
I'm wearing a dress from Torrid, I like to shop there sometimes.

Last night a pregnant Beyonce was out wearing the new Gucci duster.
Yes it apart of the 2017 spring line
The duster was paisley, silk and on a green background
She paired it with jeans and a white tee
Beyonce style staple it the white tee, jeans, and heels.
Even while pregnant she does not stray away from this style statement
Her daughter Blue was also seen wearing a spring Gucci dress
It was green and matched her mothers perfectly
They have both been spotted wearing a lot of Gucci lately
They even have custom Gucci tour jackets that match
It is good to see that pregnancy has not deterred her from having great style
It hasn't deterred her from wearing her statement high heels either.
Her Ferragamo dress from her latest date was simple chic
It was the ultimate little black dress.
She paired is with thigh high boots
It really tied the outfit together
There is something so classic about the little black dress
It is a piece that will never go out of style
She paired her dress with a pair of Tom Ford glasses.
The Tom Ford were the perfect pair with little black dress

So what did you think of Kanye West season 1 fashion line ?
Well there were a lot of green pieces of clothing.
What did you think of the male pants he created for Season 1 ?
A lot of the men's pants looked like women's Capri pants.
Why do you think Kanye west used so much green at his Season 1 fashion show ?
It's hard to say I think he used green to symbolize money.
Do you think Kanye West season 1 was a tribute to inexperience ?
Most of his clothing from his Season 1 fashion seemed uninspired.
What do you really feel about Kanye West Season 1 fashion line ?
Honestly it seemed like it was some sort of practical joke ?
What do you mean by Practical joke ?
His fashions were embarrassingly amateur it was like a 10 year old was allowed to design clothing.
What do you think about Kanye West Season 2 fashion line ?
It's even more horrible, all of his clothing at the Season Two fashion show was brown.
Why do you think he made all the clothing brown for the fashion show ?
Maybe he was paying tribute to communism ?
Do you think Kanye West's Season Two clothing line is practical everyday wear ?
Maybe for a worker in a Communist forced labor camp ?
Overall what do you think about Kanye West clothing designs ?
They are just awful.

I was watching this show that showcased an Italian man carving a cameo.
What was he making?
He was making a jewelry set. He said it takes him three days to carve one piece.
Really? What gemstone was using?
I think it was called agate.
I have quite a few cameos myself. Would you like to see them sometime?
I would love to see them.
You do know that cameos are back in style? Right?
No. This was my first time hearing of such a thing.
Well. Jewelry designers are making more and more cameos today.
It looked like hard work and tedious work.
It is. Ancient and Renaissance cameos were made from semi-precious gemstones.
It's been said that  glass cameo vessels were also developed by the Romans.
Sounds to me like you have been doing your homework.
I find cameos interesting. They can be made into rings, necklaces, pendants and earrings.
Yes. Many women love to wear them as jewelry.
In ancient times were mainly used for signet rings and large earrings.
But did you know that many modern cameos are carved into layered agates?  The layers are dyed to create strong color contrasts.
I need to add some cameos to my wardrobe.
They are a fascinating piece of jewelry.

I absolutely loved Celine Dion's dress at the Met Gala.
Yes. I really think choosing a black and white dress suited her.
Definitely! I didn't really like Kiko Mizuhara's outfit, though.
Agreed. I just didn't like the shirt.
Exactly! I didn't like how it was see-through.
Yeah, and I didn't like the way she wore the blazer off her shoulders, too.
I feel like she could've gone with a much better outfit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How would you describe your style?
Umm, I don't think I fit into a category haha.
But if you had to chose one...
Maybe I'm a hipster? I just wear what I like.
What kinda stuff do you like?
It's gotta be unique and original. And better if it's vintage.
Where do you shop?
Mostly just thrift stores. I like to find stuff there and make it my own.
What do you mean?
I like to sew on things, add patches, cut pants into shorts... whatever strikes my fancy!
Do you have a favorite piece of clothing?
Probably some old cutoff bleached men's levis. I think they've been around since 1990!
You'll have to show me the ropes of the thrift shop.
Totally. There's lots of great finds, no matter what your style.
As long as I can find something other than 20 year old shorts! haha
Definitely. But I hope they have some more for me!
What are you up to this weekend? My friend's and I are having a fashion swap!
Cool! I do have a bunch of stuff I never wear.
There's gonna be a ton of people, and we all have different styles, so you'll be able to find whatever!
Sweet! I'm in!

Have you seen this new Instagram store that sells fashionable clothes for cheap?
Maybe.  Do you know what the account is called?
I think it might be called @Fashionforless.
That sounds interesting.  Let me go check their account.
You should!
Oh, its a private account.  Are you already following them?
Yes, i am.  Let me show you the clothes they sell.
Great!  Thanks!  Have you bought anything from them?
Yes, I have!  It is this dress right here.  I got it for less than $30, planning on wearing it to an upcoming wedding.
Oh my!  That looks really nice!  And that price is pretty good!  How is the quality?
It is fairly decent quality.  Definitely looks and feels like a dress in the hundred something dollar range.
How does it fit you?
It fits me exactly to a tee.
How did you figure out your size?
There are measurements right here on each post.  So I jut measured myself for comparison.
Sounds easy enough!
It is.
Have you bought anything else from them?
I just ordered this pair of distressed jeans but it hasnt come yet.
Ohhhhh.  Tell me how it fits when you get it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish I had more money so I could be more fashionable.
I don't think you need money to be fashionable.
Really? But all the best brands cost so much!
Yeah, but haven't you seen people combine cheap clothes in interesting ways before?
Yeah, but -
And there are people who actually alter their own clothes. And even make their own from scratch.
I can't do that.
Well, have you ever tried?
No, I guess not. And if nothing else, I can try to do more with what I have.
That's the spirit!
But do you think I can ever look fashionable considering I'm a little overweight?
Of course! Anyone of any race, gender, weight, whatever can be fashionable if they have confidence in what thy're wearing and choose interesting outfits.
Do you really think so?
Definitely. And there's no one type of fashion.
What do you mean?
Everyone has different ideas about what's fashionable.
But aren't some people right and some people wrong?
Not necessarily. Think about Project Runway. Sometimes the judges legitimately disagree.
Oh, you're right.
I think what matters most is that YOU like what you wear.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who had the best dress at the Met Ball?
I wouldn't say it was the best, but I think Rhianna had the most interesting outfit. The texture and color was pretty and crazy at the same time!
What about Cara Delevigne Chanel outfit? All that shiny silvery material. What was it made of?
No idea, but what was the thing on head, was it sprayed in her hair or like a skullcap? I don't know what she was thinking.
Did you see Katy Perry in Maison Margiela? The red was totally shocking because the was so much of it.
Yeah, she almost looked like a ghost and flamigo dancer had a baby. I'm not sure that was winner but I did  like the boldness of the red.
I really liked Laura Dern in Gabriela Hearst. It was a beautiful navy gown with cut-outs, very slimming!
Yes, navy is such a good rich classic color. It was great color for her too.
I would not normally say a bird print would be a good idea, but I loved Zendaya in Dolce & Gabbana's off the shoulder, full trained dress was gorgeous!
I would just love to have a dress like that once! You're right, though who would have thought a bird pattern? Parrots at that!
What did you think of the trench coat dress on Priyanka Chopra? Can you believe it was Ralph Lauren? Really dramatic but I kind of liked it.
Yeah, me too. Who would have thought a British khaki at the Met Ball? The collar is what really does it for me.
I also liked the black dress Dakota Johnson was in. Gucci always has something worth mentioning.
Yeah, I liked it too. Cut out seems to big this year. It was a very dramatic dress and probably one of my favorites.
Laura Osnes reminded of that beautiful blue grey dress that Kerry wore in Sex In The City towards the end. The skirt with all that texture that looks like flowers is so beautiful.
I know, right? I even like the shade of pink matched with the black. Normally not a fan, too 80's but this looked really good to me too.
What was Claire Danes thinking? I did not like the weirdly dramatic white top with laced black pants.
Yeah, that outfit was a bust but even worst was her make up. Where did her eyebrows go? Normally she looks great, but I guess she was going for "artsy" being at the Met.
It reminded me of Tracee Ellis Ross in Comme des Garcons thing. What was it a bag or a dress or coat?
Yeah that was totally weird and unflattering but I did like the color. It was almost electric!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I love your dress!
Thanks! Guess where I got it?
Where did you get it from, it is so cute!
I got it from the boutique right in town.
Something Else? I love that place!
Yes! They have super cute things in there all the time!
They really do!
I love all their clothes.
I have bought so much stuff from them, i also got a floral shirt, a pair of flip flops, and a skirt.
I go there all the time!
My favorite part about their clothes is that they only get a few of each item in.
Yes, I love that. Then you wont ever see someone with your shirt on!
That is the worst! I hate seeing people with the same shirt or dress on as me!
Ugh! I know, that's why I love shopping there!
Kristin the owner is alway so helpful too! She has such a great sense of style.
She always has the best outfits!
Oh I know! If I owned that shop I would too!
Benefits of being the owner!
Well maybe we can go there together one time! But I gotta run! It was good talking to you! Bye!
Ya that would be nice! See ya!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I absolutely love that dress.
So do I. I got it on sale too.
Do they have any more?
They had a whole rack.
I think I want one.
I'll take you to get it right now if you wan.
OK. Do they have other colors?
They had it in pink. You'll look better in that.
I love how I look in pink.
It does look great on you.
Really? How about blue?
Maybe a light blue.
Did they have any blue ones?
Only really small sizes.
Darn. So let's go get it then.
It's at Fashion Central.
I love that store. Everything there is so cute.
Great prices too.
Even when things aren't on sale I can afford something.
Yes, and that's why I shop there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Levi's re-cut the 501 again?
Yeah, hopefully it fixes the stitching issues on the inseam.
Here's to hoping! Have you seen their other offerings?
Yes, I absolutely love their jackets. For both genders!
I just recently got a denim jacket from them on sale.
Is their construction similar to their other denim?
Yes! Speaking of jackets, what are your thoughts on old military jackets?
They can look nice, but only when it's over-sized and bulky.
Kind of like a grunge look?
Yes, but be careful that's going out for the new Bohemian look.
If I get a military jacket, what boots could go well with it?
I believe I've seen Liam Hemsworth wearing Red Wings and it looked really good.
I love those! It seems old mining boots go well for men and combat boots for women.
Absolutely, Krysten Ritter looks great in combat boots!
Yes! Especially paired with a nice leather jacket.
Too bad leather is prohibitively expense and unethical by some perspectives.
Yeah that's why I elected to choose a faux leather jacket and it's worked surprisingly well.
I have one of those too, it's held out quite well provided the stereotype that it won't hold out as long as real leather.
I want to get one similar to the one Bradley Cooper's been spotted wearing!
With the brown leather? I love it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what's your opinion on J Crew's new spring catalog?
Well, I did see a few things I liked, but I haven't shopped at J Crew for awhile now.
Oh really?  Where have you been buying all your clothes lately?
Mainly from John Varvatos and Barneys.
Wow.  I love both of those places, but they are always so expensive.
I defintely agree, but the clothes aren't too much more expensive than J Crews and I never shop at there main stores.
Where do you get their clothes then?
There is a outlet for both stores at Sawgrass Mills.  Great way to save money and the selection is usually great.
I will definitely have to check both out.
You should.  I've actually saved a considerable amount of money compared to retail J Crew.
Do you only shop at the oulets for these clothes?
No.  I actually look on eBay quite often as well.
I never even considered using eBay for buying clothes.  How is the selection?
The selection is great, and the price is nearly half of that in store.
Yah, but what about the condition of the clothes?  I'm looking to look good and fashionable.
There are ways to search for only new clothes on eBay, and trust me you will look good in Varvatos clothes.
Thank you for the heads up.  I think I will look tonight.  I'm trying to impress my new girlfriend.
No problem at all and let me know if you need any help.  Your girlfriend will probably want to marry you after you become more fashionable.
I would hope so.  I look like a bum now.
Yes you do, but not for long!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like my tie?
No it has too much going on.
How do you like my tie? It's azul
Blue is a nice colour on you it compliments your eyes
I think complimenting my eyes is important.
How else do you like to express your dress?
Well that is a funny way to say fashion
Suits and ties are not always fashionable.
Have you read the latest issue of vouge?
No I haven't
They have an excerpt on ties and how to successfully dress.
What did they say about complementing the eyes?
They said it was a very hot thing to do.
Well I am not sure if I would use the word hot
Right me niether
So what is the rest of the issue about?
Oh, you now ca-tour dresses from Spain and the latest happenings in paris
Wasn't it fashion week last week
I don't think so, I think fashion week is in the fall.
Oh that's right where is my sense for fashion
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the last episode of Keeping up with the Kardashians?
I did! I thought Khloe looked so hot in her body suit and skin tight jeans.
I know! With her sexy little outfits she always wears, she has an endless line of guys trying to get with her.
Yeah, it's just too bad most of them are black though.
Well, black guys actually have a great sense of fashion!
I'll agree with you there... Some colors just look so much better on them than on white people!
Yes, especially a fresh white T shirt that is a couple of sizes too big.
Yeah, no way a white guy can pull that off.
True that. But I will say, plaid shorts look excellent on a white man.
Mhm. Especially with a light grey t-T-shirt.
But not plaid shirts. Save those for the mexicans.
Haha! Yeah that sounds about right.
Know what is really hot?
No, What?
When a girl who has a perfect badonkadonk wheres some tight yoga pants.
Oh I know! I see those everywhere these days. They had that whole body shameing scandel over them at the high schools...
What do you mean?
Well, as nice as a girls butt is to look at in those pants, people where claiming they were a distraction to male students and teachers.
Oh thats not fair, they should be able to control themselves over a womens fashion choice.
I agree!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Sharon,I have been watching the fashion shows and you would not believe what the models have been wearing on their feet.
What could it be other than heels, Lexa?
Yes but I have seen them in breathable boots in monochromatic colors at Salvatore Ferragamo.
So you think monochromatic colored boots are a hot fashion trend to follow.
No, but Erdem’s snakeskin combination with ankle lacing and gorgeous platform heels certainly would make a statement if I ever wore them
Platform heels? Out of the question.
You can dress up the plainest of outfits and dresses with a good pair of platform heels.
Not with the ones I have seen. Those things are not for me.
How do you feel about the flat versions of the platform heels?
Flat version? I have not heard about them.
The flat version are a platform and flats combined.
So, it's a flat shoe on a platform. Is that what you are telling me?
Yes.
Flat shoes are not good for your feet.  I don't wear flat shoes.
But they were so cute. There was one that was red and white.
You can be cute all the way to the podiatrist if you want.
You don't have to wear them all of the time.
And you don't have to wear them at all.
There's just no winning with you on these shoes is there?
Nope.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the stunning dresses at the MET Gala this year?
Yes, I Absolutely adored Selena Gomez's white long gown with the knee slit, absolutely gorgeous!
I agree. My favorite had to be Katy Perry, though. She shocked everyone in that red dreary veil and custom crimson Galliano coat.
Yes, that outfit was definitely inspiring. What also caught my eye was Bella Hadid in a tight black crystal embellished jumpsuit custom made by Alexander Wang.
Yes! Her body looked amazing in the skin tight jumpsuit and the black high heels to match were to die for!
Absolutely, although I was also not impressed by someone who I look forward to seeing every year, Kate Hudson. She is a vision in the white flowing gown she wore by Stella McCartney but she has done this look before.
I agree. I feel that every time I see her on a carpet she is wearing a white gown. How about the men? I thought Donald Glover's Burberry suit was both elegant and sophisticated.
Yes, it was. Burberry was a popular choice that night. Matt Smith also wore a Burberry suit with an eccentric tie that looked Victorian-like but impressive.
Another one of my least favorites was Gwyneth Paltrow who wore a simple and tight one shoulder pill dress by Calvin Klein.
I agree, it was a boring choice. Her black shoes definitely clashed with the tight pink and non-flattering dress she wore.
How about Joe Jonas in custom H&M? He looked debonair as he posed in the red and black stripe finely fitted suit.
Yes, he definitely dressed to impress! I loved how him and Lena Dunham matched since they both wore red!
I saw the picture they took together, it was hilarious. Her long red strapless gown was the exact same red as his suit. It was meant to be.
Someone who also wowed me was Kendall Jenner who showed up in a barely there gown with a black sash on the front and see-through back.
Yes, it was very risqué but what we expected. Her sister Kylie Jenner stunned in custom Versace in the platinum colored gown she wore.
Yes, even matching with Donatella Versace herself. They both wore metallic gowns.
Yes, I was not expecting that duo. We have to talk about Rihanna's gown which was  a pure piece of art.
Yes, she was a vision. I was surprised that small balls attached to her did not fall off as she was walking, I do not know how she kept it on the entire night!
Yes, Rihanna's gown looked extremely uncomfortable and unwearable.
I agree, but I saw pictures of her at her after party where she changed into a more comfortable jeans and white t-shirt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to Fashion week this year?
Yes, I think I'm going to see the fall collections in New York this Fall.
What will you wear?
Well, it depends on the shows I will see but something beautiful of course.
I've been really into stuff from Kenzo and Balenciaga lately.
Me too.
What do you think about this seasons trends?
I don't like getting involved with the newest fashion trends all that much.
I know what you mean. I like a lot of classics fashion pieces.
Absolutely, you can never go wrong with classic fashion pieces from the times or Audrey Hepburn or even Marilyn Monroe.
Definitely. Sometimes I like a newer print but for the most part I like neutrals and black.
You can never go wrong in basic black.
That's for sure!
Where are you heading now? Shopping?
Yes, actually I am headed over to H&M. They always have the best designer collaborations and they're inexpensive.
So true. I loved their collection with Isabel Marant.
Target also does some great collaborations.
Yes, for sure. They are great especially for fashion for younger girls.
Yes, they have great basic pieces like solid tank tops and classic t shirts.
I agree!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like those fashions, that minic years past?
Not at all bell bottoms should stay in the seventies.
Not even the eighties? it was an awesome decade.
Are you joking?, shoulder pads and neon colors, no thank you.
So you would perfer somthing more today.
I just want something new.
What do you mean, like futurisic?
Maybe, i'm just tired of the same old things.
Ok, tin foil hat's and space helmets then.
Ha, Ha, no nothing that far out.
You know what i like, movie costumes when they predict the future.
exactly, if it's so easy for costume designers to be creative why can't fashion designers?
Well tha't true, fashion does seem to be in a rut.
A several year, long rut.
I'm optomistic, fashion will evole soon.
And if it doesn't it can  do what it always does, come out with bell bottoms again and act like it's new.
Sometimes fashion designers put on.. way out there shows.
But none of them ever really translate to the every day people.
Oh well, I for one like bell bottoms.
You can keep them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like wearing dresses in the summer time?
Absolutely. I love chiffon dresses. Anything yellow or blue from Forever 21 is beautiful.
I'm not a big fan of Forever 21 anymore. I think their clothing is cheaply made. Plus I heard they don't pay their employees well.
Well, that doesn't bother me. I love cheap clothing. I just bought a red A-line dress from them.
I actually prefer Ann Taylor. I think their clothing is more sophisticated. I'm going there this weekend to get a lovely sheath dress for work.
Oooh that does sound lovely. I love sheath dresses because they always look so professional!
Yes, anything classic cut or with a collar and buttons looks professional. Did you know Forever 21 does have professional-looking button ups for sale?
Haha, you're really trying to convince me to shop there huh? It's quite alright, I do go there sometimes for basics. Like I get my tank tops from there.
See! I knew you would give in eventually. Hey when do you plan to go shopping this weekend? I would love to go with you.
I'm planning to go on Saturday morning. I have other things going on later in the day. Will you be able to come with? You can give me feedback on the sheath dress?
I think I should be able to make a Saturday morning shopping trip. Gosh, sometimes I wish I made more money so I can shop at more expensive stores - like Coach or something.
I thought you like cheap fashion?
I do! It's just that sometimes it might be nice to spoil myself with a beautiful Chanel dress or something.
Right?! I would love a Chanel suit. I sure do admire the classic Chanel jacket look.
And since we can't afford those labels, we will just stick to mall labels. I'm fine with that. As long as I have clothes on my body.
Maybe if we start saving money slowly we can each treat ourselves to a lovely designer label dress or outfit. I've always admired runway labels like Zuhair Murad.
I know! His designer gowns are soooo dreamy and whimsical. Wedding dress caliber!
I would love a bespoke Zuhair Murad gown. If I were a rich celebrity, I would support him 100%.
You can try to marry a rich celebrity and then grow your wardrobe?
Haha, yes and you can do that too so you can move away from the cheap fashion!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, Leslie, I have a question.
Shoot.
Since you are an aspiring fashion designer, my question is... What’s on the horizon for skirt/dress lengths?
Well, I think you should look for everything from full circle skirts to flowy midis and maxis to flippy, flirty miniskirts this spring.
So the maxi look is still in? We aren't over that yet?
Are you kidding me?  At least one maxi dress is should be in every woman's wardrobe.
You are so right.
It is a must-have look for those women who want to look fabulous without much effort.
Okay. We've got the dress part down how about the toe styles?
You mean like for shoes/boots: square, pointy, platform?
Exactly.
Square toes are out.
Thank-god. I personally never liked square toes on any type of shoe, pump, or boot.
That blocky shape is truly unflattering on the foot.
So, I take it pointy  toes will be making a come back.
They are but I hope  not at the extreme lengths of a few years back.
Those were just hideous.
You aren't kidding. I couldn't stand them myself.
You know, of all the shoe-toe shapes, my personal favorite is the almond.
Probably because it is  a gentle oval that makes legs look long and lean. It’s so sophisticated looking.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you wear to the party last night?
I wore my leggings with a tank top and my black jacket.
I love your black jacket. Who makes it?
Thanks! It's Michael Kors actually.
Where did you get it?
I bought it a couple years ago at Macy's. It was pretty expensive. Do you like Muchael Kors?
I do. I love his line.
I also have a beautiful gold sequin shirt from his line.
I bet it's gorgeous. Where do you wear it?
I was going to wear it to a bar or club but I haven't had the chance yet.
Do you ever wear dresses out at night?
Sometimes, I have some beautiful mid calf length dresses that work well at night. What about you?
I prefer jeans or pants at night. I usually like a nice pair of dark jeans made by seven jeans or Paige brand.
I love those brands too. I like the length on them since I'm kind of tall.
Have you ever tried true religion jeans?
Yes, I like the length on them but they are most hip huggers and I like high waisted jeans a little better.
I know what you mean. I don't like hip hugger jeans that much but I like the larger pocket on true religion jeans.
Ya I like that they are funkier than the average jeans brand.
Me too. I like a lot of their washes.
Me too. They have some beautiful light blue washes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Kelly Rowland at the Gala last night?
I did! Wasn't her gold, body fitting dress beautiful?
It was, but what who made it for her again?
I believe it was a Givenchy piece.
That's right. Givenchy was also worn by Adele as well!
Her gown was a mettalic hunter green, with beautiful beading and gemstones cascading down it.
Her and her companion that night, Lady Gaga, took the cake.
I was suprised Lady Gaga was wearing something so formal!
I know! Her slinky, silver sequin piece matched her glamourous silver makeup and Louboutins.
Of course, Beyonce showed up and took everyone's breath away.
You said it. She always wears gold, and it looks so beautiful on her...
Her ombre look was definitlely one of the most unique that night.
Lets not forget Nicki Minaj, though. She came with a simple, form fitting gown in royal blue by Alexander McQueen.
I noticed! Her shoes were beautiful, but it looked like she could hardly stand in them!
I believe they were Gucci.
They looked like it. The large rhinestones were the flash of luxury she needed to finish off her simple but stunning look.
Who was wearing the mermaid gown with gold foil embroidery again?
It was one of the Kardashians! She had on a Valentino dress with Jimmy Choo heels.
Her jewelry was beautiful as well, but it looked so expensive!
I believe those were Biorgioni pieces. She didn't buy it however, she just wore it and gave it back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's so hard to choose the right wedding dress.
Yes it is. A bride wants to look stylish,  but she knows her children will be looking at those pictures in twenty years.
Yes. She wants to look appropriate now, and later too.
At the same time, she doesn't want to wear something bland and boring.
But she doesn't want the aunties to gossip about her outrageous dress, either.
It's a question of balance.
You're right! Don't show too much skin, but don't cover up like a nun, either.
Don't wear too much sparkle, but wear a little something that makes it all pop.
Make your mother happy, but please the groom, too.
Oh, and the bridesmaids. Choose something for them that they can wear again, somewhere, somehow.
Maybe something bright, instead of those dull pastels.
I went to a wedding where the bridesmaids wore black.
I bet that caused talk.
It did, but everybody I heard seemed to  approve. They wore elegant, summery, black dreses.
And I bet the contrast helped the bride stand out, too.
Yes. She looked just gorgeous.
Sounds lovely. I saw some print bridesmaid dresses in a magazine.
Ooh. That sounds a little distracting.
I thought so too. People would be looking at  the bridesmaids insteead of the bride.
No fun for the bride, I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new designs for wedding dresses this year?
No! When did they come out?
Last week, I believe.  Would you like to see them?
Sure!  I can't believe it's only 3 months until my own wedding.
Are you thinking of a traditional wedding gown or a more modern look?
I like the idea of a simple, A-line dress with lace.
That sounds lovely.  Long or short sleeves?
I was actually thinking of capped sleeves.
Good choice!  Have you thought about adding a pop of color or will it be all white?
I was actually thinking of going with an ecru or ivory gown.  I want it to photograph well and I think it would look better with my complexion
What about the length?  I think tea length would look great and show off your legs.
I really like the idea of a floor length dress.  I think a little train looks best in pictures.
I got ya'.  Have you thought about the weight of the dress? Are you leaning toward one fabric over another?
I think I want a simple cotton or silk, as opposed to brocades and heavy fabrics.
Do you want any beading?
No.  I think it's tacky!
Have you thought about what the bridesmaids will be wearing?
Oh, yeah! Since the guys are wearing soft gray suits, I was thinking of having the girls wear Tiffany Blue.
That sounds beautiful.  I can't wait to see it.
Me, either.  Now, help me find the dress of my dreams!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who did you feel had the best fashion sense at the 2017 Met Gala ?
Well I really liked Kendall Jenner's La Perla gown.
What did you explicitly like about Kendall's La Perla gown ?
The had painted 85,000 crystals that covered her dress.
What did you think about Kylie Jenner's dress ?
Well I liked her Atelier Versace dress, I thought it showed off her body.
Who did you think was the best dressed couple ?
I really liked Jennifer Lopez and J Rod's clothing.
What designed was Jennifer Lopez wearing ?
She was wearing a light blue Valentino dress that seemed to flow.
What did you think about Selena Gomez dress ?
I liked her lingerie inspired coach dress it was very form fitting.
What did you think of Blake LIvely's dress ?
I loved her golden Versace dress but even more I loved the blue feather like material that flowed down like a train from her dress.
Did you think Chrissy Teigen was sort of ripping off Blake Lively's dress with the feathers at the bottom ?
Well in a way yes but the dressed looked totally different.
Who's dress did you like the most ?
Well I really liked the simplicity of Kim Kardashian's white Westwood Gown dress.
Who did you think made the boldest fashion statement ?
I really thought the simplicity yet different style that Kate Hudson had with her Stella McCartney one sleeve white dress was inspiring.
XXXXXXXXXXX
so are you thinking of going to the dance?
yes, but it is really hard choosing what to wear
well, what about the dresses in your closet?
they are fine, but since it is latin dance, I kind of want something sexy to match the theme
Maybe something flashy too?
yes, something that is sexy, move well with the movement of the dance, so showcase the steps and the beats better
So are you thinking of going dress shopping?
yes
how about we go together this weekend?
ok
I want to get something news for the dance too since you mention it
any preference?
yes, something tight and flashy, so it looks good when I spin in salsa
I love salsa
and probably some high heels too
I think so
so which of the latin dance do you like so far?
I like salsa and tango
I hope they have lots of salsa song this dance
me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
This new trend of barely wearing your coat seems silly to me.
Barely wearing your coat? Isn't that defeating the purpose of wearing a coat?
Yeah. First they came out with that editor's cape foolishness.
I think I remember that one. That was the one where you wore your coat like a cape.
Yeah. The look of oh-so-casually wearing your coat perched atop your shoulders without your arms slung through the sleeves.
I tried that one. I didn't like it much.
Why would anyone like it? It left your arms free to do whatever buy you couldn't raise your in editors' shoulders.
That look was way too restrictive.
The editor's cape is fading into distant memory and is being replaced by something even less practical.
Let me guess. The laid back look of  shrugged shoulder?
Oh. So you have seen that one?
Yeah.  That is worse than the editors' cape.
I think so too.
I mean. Your shoulders and parts of your chest are exposed to the cold.
There is no way you can stay warm on a chilly day dressed like that.
Makes me shiver to my bones just thinking about it.
Especially with the below freezing winters we have had over the past five years.
Yeah. You would freeze to death if you tried that look in our part of the country.
It could work in a state like Florida.
I don't think so.  They don't get all that cold there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which dress do you think I should get? The pink one, or the blue one?
Depends where you plan to wear them.
How'd you mean?
Well, I wouldn't wear a pink dress to a chinese take-out; I love the stuff, I'd probably make a mess of the dress.
I see what you mean, it could get stains on it.
Right. Also, what where you thinking of wearing with them?
Well, I thought with the blue one I might wear brogues; and the pink one, trainers.
I meant in terms of, say, a cardigan; or...
Oh, of course. Well, I'm not certain, then. Maybe a poncho?
A poncho?... With which dress?
With either dress.
Oh dear.
''Oh dear?'' What's that supposed to mean?
Well, I don't think those items would suit one another well.
That response is a little more muted compared to your initial reaction. Do you doubt my fashion sense?
Well, yes; honestly.
I can't believe this. I thought we were friends.
We are, I'm just being honest with you.
Well you could have been a little nicer about it. You know I like to make a statement in my fashion choices.
Yes, yes. I know. Well what are friends for?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you wearing?
I am not sure.
Can I look at the tag?
I guess so.
The tag has been removed,
I bought it at a thrift store.
You shop at those?
Yeah, when I'm short on money.
I could take you shopping.
You could?
Yes, it would be my treat.
That works for me.
Where should we start?
Maybe at the mall?
The mall it is.
How much can we spend?
How much does a new wardrobe cost.
About two thousand.
That sounds about right.
I'm going to be in style for once!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Miley Cyrus' dress at the MTV awards?
Oh my gosh, yes I did. It was crazy! But nothing like Lady Gaga.
You are so right about that! She wore a meat dress!
Right?! I could hardly believe it when I saw her.
Just waiting for Kate Hudson to jump out with her new "Fabletics" line.
That would have been amazing! I love her leggings.
They just look so comfortable.
I would wear those with just about anything.
Have you seen Kelly Osbourne?
Yes, I love her sense of fashion. She gets me!
She seems to know a lot about fashion, and what is all the trends.
Her dad doesn't have a lot of fashion sense though.
Speaking of dads, have you seen Suri Cruise? Well not about her dad.
I know, She is gorgeous. She could be a fashion model.
Her dad is quite stylish, albeit a bit strange. I do like a sharp dressed man.
You know who is a sharp dressed man, LL Cool J.
I love those shirts he wears. They really show off his muscles.
Yes, they do. He could be a model.
Isn't he a fashion model?
I really don't know. I wonder.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the direction modern fashion is taking?
I like it. It has come a long way since flare leg jeans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you bought new white t shirts lately?
Yes,I just did.
What kind did you buy?
I bought the Hanes brand.
I use the fruit of a loom.
How do you like them?
I like the way they feel after a free washes.
Oh yeah, how about the color.does it go yellow?
No they stay white.
Nice, so do mine.
Does your neck line stretch out?
Yeah, it's a problem I have.
Mine to.
How long does it take for that to happen?
Maybe 15 washes.
That sounds about right.
Do you know of any other brand?
Not really? How about you?
Yeah, Simmons white.
Thanks I'll check them out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did Kim Kardashinan wear yesterday?
How am I supposed to know, I don't know fashion.
Yes you do, I know you secretly watch that show.
Okay, okay, it's true, she wore that little black catour dress that has the really low cut.
I be she looked like a slut. I mean she is a slut right? Her style really says so.
Ha, yea, she is a bit like that. I bet she doesn't put out though, I mean have you heard that she wears designer nose rings.
Really is that for some kind of S&M sort of fantasy?
I bet it is. I mean it is made to order, supposedly, but the point is when people dress like that they ask for a certain audience.
And I guess we are both in that audience because I mean we both like to see skin.
Well who doesn't like skin. She is hot and why not use clothing to express that.
A valid point. Clothing is as much of an expression of who you are as your facebook page.
I don't know if that is true in my case. Maybe if all my posts are old and not hip.
Are you wearing tights?
Yes, I like to wear them under my pants.
That must get uncomfortable. How do you do it?
Well you know what they say suffer for fashion. And it is my own style, why not?
Well maybe cuz it can't feel very good to have your junk up in those.
It actually breaths quite well considering it  wasn't meant to be used as a male accessory
Do you ever read the instructions? It could be hazardous to your health.
Well I never read anything about that. All I know is it looks great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think will be the hottest trend of the summer?
Who knows it seems like fashion nowadays is singled out
How so?
People pick their own fashion, they dont look to the stars anymore
I think with the birth of the internet you might be right
Sites like pinterest take all of the motions out of it
I agree to an extent
Do you like to pick your own fashion?
I will be honest I prefer it to be told to me
You are in the minority, go to Forever 21
Oh i know they have a ton of styles
Yeah so you can pick your own look
And they make them cheaply dont they
I dont know about that but how many years do you wear stuff?
Usually about once.
Exactly so why pay more
I guess thats the direction they are going
I think so and thats where itll stay
I dont agree I think its just the trend we are in
No people are more  conscious with spending now
XXXXXXXXXXX
Janice, what are you doing today?
Nothing much, I was planning on staying in and reading a book.
Have you not opened your windows today? It is beautiful and sunny.
I just got out of the shower, grabbed a book, and a cup of coffee.
Did you you brush your teeth?
Yes, I brushed my teeh, but I couldn't find anything to wear so I just decided to stay inside.
Well I have a better idea.
What great idea do you have sister?
How about you, Stacy, and I hook up and hit the mall.
I don't know if I am feeling like going to the mall today, i look a mess.
That's why I'm telling you to get up and let's go and get some clothes.
I don't have much money.
Don't worry, Stacy just got paid. She got us.
Girl, you are hilarious.
I know.
So where is Stacy now?
She's right here listening to everything we are saying. She has her credit cards ready.
Okay, so let me get dressed. How long will it take for you guys to get here?
We are at the door. Open up. It's time to get your wardrobe together.
I'm ready.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you enjoy the fashions Met-Gala this year?
Yes it was great! How did you enjoy the red carpet looks?
I loved them. Rhianna was my favorite.
Yes. She really stuck to the theme of the night, which was to celebrate fashion designer Rei Kawakubo.
Certainly. Her dress was big, bold, and very unique.
Yes it was. I had never heard of the designer Rei Kawakubo until now.
I have never heard of her either. I think this year's dedication will really bring her a lot more recognition.
I agree. I also enjoyed Rihanna's makeup that went with the dress.
Yes. The elaborate pink eye shadow was a great touch and really brought out her facial features.
Also her hairstyle really topped it off as well.
Yes. The bun on top of her head was incredible.
Interestingly her hair and makeup did not take away or conflict with the dress.
No, they didn't. All 3 went together perfectly.
I wonder if she chose this dress herself?
Possibly a stylist, however it would not surprise me if she chose it on her own.
Yes. She has a unique, wicked style all on her own.
Yes. I think that is why she was able to pull this look off.
Right. We are already used to seeing her in flamboyant outfits.
I think she was best dressed of the night.
I agree. Well done Rihanna!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Isn't it funny how popular flannel is again?
Yeah, it's just like the 90s.
I owned something like 20 flannel shirts.
Wow!  I maybe had five.
Back then, it was all about grunge rock.
Yeah, grunge rockers in Seattle and their flannel shirts.
I think they just wore them because they were cheap.
I think so.  It's not clear why they're so popular now.
Maybe people are inspired by Duck Dynasty.
Ha!  I doubt it!
Maybe the fashion industry just started prompting the shirts themselves.
That would make sense.
You know what else was popular in the 90s?
What?
Baggy jeans.
That's the opposite of the way things are now.
Yeah, I can't believe the skinny jeans some people fit into.
I think they'd be really uncomforable.
Yeah, life is too short for skinny jeans.
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like fashion?
Yes, I love fashion!
Have you seen the show "Project Runway?"
Yes, it is a great show.
I love when they make things that you wouldn't expect.
Yes, they are always so original.
Yes, it is so interesting.
I feel bad for the people who don't win.
Yeah, but their ideas are usually not so original.
Yes, fashion is in one moment and out the next.
Yes, you have to be innovative.
Of course, people's styles are always changing.
Do you like dresses?
Yes, I love fancy ones especially with sequins.
Oh yes, I adore sequins.
It must take a lot for someone to design a sequins dress.
Yes, it takes a lot of time to make something nice.
I wonder how they make they dresses so quickly on Project Runway.
I don't know how they do it.
They are some amazing designers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is that brand you are wearing.
It's a designer out of the UK called UK designs.
It's very well fitted, is it supposed to be that tight?
Yes and no, It may have shrunk in the wash cycle
Well that is a shame.
Thanks, am I able to pull off a tight look?
Not at all but your confidence is the think that rocks through
Wow I never thought of my self esteem effecting my fashion
Well it really can, trust me, I was once very nervousness and lacked confidence in everything.
Was it not until I found fashion did my life get better. So fashion really made you confident?
Yes indeed. I found that being able to express myself anyway I wanted I was able to grow as a person.
So what styles attract you the most?
Well, let's see, I really like to dress in modern styles that have lots of colour. What about you?
Well I would have to say formal wear is my favorite. I just like to look posh.
Is that because you aren't posh?
Pretty much. I only really wear what people would like to see me in. In that way I am a push-over
That is true, but where did you get your shoes?
Well I got them at pay-less actually, they where a steal.
And they are so cute on you. I wish I had shoes like that.
I know I like that they are high tops and have an extreme amount of colours.
XXXXXXXXXXX
where do you like to shop for clothes , accessories and shoes?
I like to shop at gap for clothes.
where do you like to shop for accessories?
I like to shop at target and aeropostale for accessories most of the time.
How about shoes , where do you shop for shoes?
Shoes are a problem for me.
why are they a problem?
because my size is unique.
what is unique about your foot?
my foot is extremely wide and it is hard to find some shoes that fit.
can you buy shoes online?
yes, but it is a not a good way for me.
why is that?
because I have to try shoes on to make sure they fit.
What is your favorite shoe store then?
Well, believe it or not I like to go to payless.
Do you think payless has cheap shoes?
yes, some are cheap, but I worry more about fit that quality.
I will check them out, I thought they were not worth it.
yes, please do, you will be surprised.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to update my wardrobe with some spring pieces soon.
Me too, I was looking through Vogue recently reading about the new spring 2017 trends.
What were the trends?
Well, there are a lot of pieces coming out in the color pink.
I like baby pink and candy pink. Balenciaga has some beautiful spring pieces in pink.
Pink is very trendy this year.
Florals are big this spring as usual.
True, but this year they have more of a 1970s vibe to them.
I might try a geometric print. Maybe on a maxi dress or a skirt.
Sonia Rykiel just came out with a really cool geometric print poncho. It was a part of the spring fashion runway show.
I'll look up a picture of it later.
While you're online, look for jumpsuits. I think a jumpsuit is a great piece to have for spring and summer.
I agree. I may try to find a denim jumpsuit.
I want one too.
I'm going to buy a ton of leggings as well.
I love leggings they're so comfortable so I'm glad they're on trend this season.
Louis Vuitton designed some gorgeous lace leggings for Spring.
Y/Project makes beautiful velvet leggings.
Velvet and lace leggings are great because they can be dressed up to wear out for the evening.
I know, style and comfort. What more could you ask for?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where did you get your new hat?
Do you like it?
Yeah, it's really cool. What store did you get it from?
I got it down at the J Crew at the mall. There were some really cool belts there, too.
Really? What kind of belts did you see?
There were a bunch! Black leather, brown leather, and a really cool white one.
What's up with the white one?
It was a Jennifer Lopez belt, with white leather and silver trim.
Jennifer Lopez, huh? Did she have any other clothing there?
Yeah. I saw quite a few of her pieces. She also had some capris.
Did you buy a pair of capris?
No, but I was thinking about it. They were pretty pricey.
How much were they? Her stuff is always expensive.
They were eighty dollars each! That's too much.
How about tops? Did you see any?
I saw a really cute red top with blue trim. Don't tell anyone, but I bought that one.
Nice! Does it have a design on it?
Not really. It's just plain red with some blue trim around the collar. It's a boat neck.
I love boat necks, but I can't wear them anymore.
Yeah. I prefer crewnecks now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I see you're back to wearing your floral dresses this spring, Jackie.
Yes, they say long floral dresses are in this spring.
I can understand that. It is warmer now and the warmer months are all about staying cool and looking chic.
Preferably at the same time.
I guess long floral dresses are the perfect item to have in your wardrobe.
Whether you are heading to the office, an outdoor wedding or brunch with your girlfriends, the floral dress is the perfect item to have in your wardrobe.
I see.
The best part about owning a maxi dress is that it’s the ultimate throw-on-and-go item in your closet.
You're right about that.
Another thing that is in this spring is sheer.
Sheer?
Yes. Layering isn't just about keeping warm anymore—it's about adding another dimension to your outfit.
And sheer does that?
A sheer top is a more subtle  way to show some skin this spring.
Well, not for me it isn't but to each his own.
You have to get with the times, Jasmine.
I'm sorry but walking around in sheer clothing is like walking around nearly naked to me.
You are such a traditionalist. You like being covered up.
I have respect for my body and myself. I am not a follower of all fashion trends.
I know. I know.

Which Italian fashion designer launched the first virtual online museum in December 2011?
Valentino was the fashion designer that launched the first virtual online museum
Where did you get those new sandals
Payless was having a sale. So I went and got these
Vestiophobia is the irrational fear of which items?
I heard that it is the fear of clothes. Crazy right!
Achille Maramotti founded which Italian fashion house in 1951?
I'm pretty sure it was Max Mara
Which British model was named ‘The Face of ’66′ by the Daily Express newspaper?
I think I read somewhere that twiggy was

I believe that Savile Row is where the headquarters is located

What are students wearing now when it comes to interviews?
Well, a lot of students go for the typical business suit but are being told they need something to make themselves stand out.
Ah! How are they making themselves stand out?
How are they making themselves stand out and still look professional?
Yes, of course!
They do things like wear a gray suit and match their button up shirt and shoes perfectly. The shoe color is a conversation starter but it doesn't make them stand out in a bad way.
What is something that guys can do specfically?
Guys tend to match their socks to their tie or bow tie. There's a company called Happy Socks that has a variety of socks.
So are socks a conversation starter?
Most definitely! Designed socks are a huge trend. I've seen them at all types of formal events.
What formal events have you seen them at?
Well a big one is weddings. The groom and groomsmen all wear different socks. Sometimes within the wedding color scheme and sometimes something as fun as superheros.
Where else?
Prom. Company formal events. I'm even willing to bet if we checked all the guy's socks on the red carpet we'd find something fun.
That's interesting. So back to interview attire. For the student who doesn't want to wear a suit or can't afford one, how do they stay "in?"
For guys I think a suit is a non-negotiable. It doesn't necessarily have to be a matching suit set though. You can probably get away with something like gray pants, a white shirt, red tie and blue jacket.
If they can't afford a suit how would they get that combination?
Thrifting or borrowing pieces from friends. Thrifting is a HUGE "it" thing right now!
Thrifting? could you tell me more about that?
Well fashion comes in cycles so when something retro is back in what better place to find it than a thrift store? That way you truly have the original style.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what kind of sandals will be trendy this year?
Arent they all the same?
Not really.
I think they all are pronounced enough to not have a difference
They do vary sometimes you have the Roman look that is big in style.
Well lets move on thats kind of boring, sandals are sandals
OK how about hat-wear.
I think the Kentucky Derby is the only time women wear those.
I see them at the beach all the time.
Well I wont wear hats they look terrible on women
I agree, I dont know why they wear them to begin with.
Do you have any styles you wear no matter what.
I dont pay attention to the white after Labor Day rule.
I agree, I wear what I want when I want.
Men get it easy they can wear whatever they want whenever they want.
Jeans and a T Shirt will always be in
Very much so
I think that men should vary a little bit
They were wearing capris for a couple of years
I think that was Russians only
XXXXXXXXXXX
This w0rld is crazy about fashion.
I like old fashion.
why so?
It has modesty?
What is particular about it?
It is not revealing and not half naked.
But today fashion is quite comfortable and general.
Yes, that is right,pants and shirt is universal .
When it comes to fashion, I think asian countries are leading.
Which one?
Like India, china or indonesia.
Yes, they are very colorful and with varieties.
I have seen so many kind of fashion designs in india, and they are gorgeous.
I agree, but have to be careful about quality.
Now, a days, it is easy to buy then to customized. Do u think so?
Yes, marketing is very easy and cheaper.
Internet has made it very easy and affordable.
I myself got so many through internet.
which site?
ebay

Did you  see Kanye's new line of clothes?
Yes, man it is something else, like very out there.
It is. Did you like any of his collection?
I like a few pieces, he makes a sort of gauzy broken up shirt in cream and it is really attractive , did you?
I liked on jacket he made, denim with some random patches and baggy. Did you see what his wife wore to the Met Gala?
The off the shoulder really plain white gown?
Yes, sort of light cotton, did you like it?
I liked it if I wear to wear it to the beach. Did you think Blake Lively's gown was nice?
I did! It was really pretty, with the form fitting gold and detail. Who did you think was the best dressed that night?
That is hard, I would say Blake Lively.
I would agree, of course. Who was the worst dressed?
The Girl form Girls, with the over-sized red and checkered  kilt dress. Ugh, did you see it?
Lena Dunham? Yes, I thought it was an ugly material, reminded me of last year when everyone wore just crazy outfits.
Like Zayn, with his metallic arm, how was that fashion?
His tuxedo was tailored wonderfully, that piece brings me back to this year, did you see Katy Perry at the met?
Yes, that was so confusing. The red mourning gown and the weird face mask. Looked like a lady Gaga want to be.
I like LAdy Gaga fashion, when she wore the meat suit.
The meat suit was so weird, I liked her clothes at the super bowl though.
I think she looked like sponge-bob, her outfits at least.
She has really changed her fashion style, and I enjoy it more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So now that I'm a little heavier, where should I shop for fashion?
Lane Bryant created the first modern maternity dresses, and her company's ads were the first to mention pregnancy. What a scandal!
But isn't her stuff kind of matronly?
Not really. But try Torrid if you want sexy things in Plus Sizes.
Well, no, I don't really want sexy, exactly. Just some interesting clothes.
Try Modcloth then. They use real women in their ads, and carry a full size range of vintage and indie clothing.
But aren't they part of WalMart now?
They're an independent part of of a subsidiary. But if you like cute clothes, you won't care.
I dont want to shop online, though, I want to try things on in the store. And I dont want to overspend.
You might like Forever 21, then. Although it's mostly young looks, they do carry a full range of sizes.
Their prices are pretty good? Money's tight.
Very good, sometimes. But you know, it's fast fashion, not the classics.
Sounds good. Have you got more stores like that?
There's Topshop. They're actually an English brand, but they sell over here too.
And they have my size?
Yes. And looks you won't find anywhere else.
Well, thanks for your help. Shopping can be depressing when you're overweight.
Are you kidding? You look fine.
Then why can't I find fashion I like?
Sweetie, the average woman is a plus size. They do make clothes for us--they have to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about monokinis?
I like them.  You don't have to show so much skin and still be stylish
You would get weird tan lines though.
This is true.
I guess you could alternate with a regular bikini to even out the tan.
For my personally it doesn' matter.
How about swimsuits with multiple straps, do you like those?
Yeah I find them ineresting.
And I suppose you don't mind the unusual tan lines?
Not al all.
Are there colors you prefer?
I like black because it's classic.
I think I prefer bright fun colors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hi, do you want to talk about fashion.
Sure that sounds good.
What kind of shoes do you like.
I love vans, I'm wearing black and white ones right now.
I prefer nikes, they have so many different kinds.
Vans do too, we'll different patterns.  I have some Mackey mouse ones.
Well nikes don't have patterns, but they have shocks and Jordan's and lots of different ones.
That's true, I don't really prefer athletic ones. I also like Sperrys.
I like Sperrys to.  I have a pair that's grey and leopard, Sperrys are cute
I want the Sperrys that look more like flats. I don't have a pair of those yet
I just got a pair of those yesterday, I love them.
Are they comfortable?
Yes, they are very comfortable. I've been wearing them all day I need to go get me some of those then
Yes, you would really like them, and they are cute with my Jean Capris
That sounds nice
I can't them in black and white first then I want some new patterns.
I got the black ones
You cant go wrong with black.
No then you can wear them with everything
XXXXXXXXXXX
Here we are at the lake again, with our leggings on.
It's a beautiful day for a run.
Yeah but I'm insecure. All the skinny young things with their ponytails bouncing, and nothing else.
Oh, nobody sees us. Let's go.
No? I feel conspicuous, running aat my age.
You're not though. Just remember the rule of 40.
What rule? Ah, I can haradly speak.
Let's slow down a little. The rule of 40 says women over 40 are invisible on the street.
Oh... See what you mean.
Right. Nobody even sees us.
You think?
Yeah. So don't worry, run your heart out.
I--I am.
The leggings help so much, too. They compress, so they feel good and look good.
Prints conceal too. I hope.
Nobody cares. I promise.
I know, but...
Who cares. Just run.
Done. Thank God.
Yeah! Good tights, good run.

Who wore it better on the red carpet, Jessica Findlay or Andie MacDowell?
I personally liked Andie MacDowell's dress better.
I like Jessica's dress better, its more fitted and gives a lot more shape than Andie's dress.
But the black belt on Andie's really ties the whole dress together.
I think the black belt reminds me too much of a kid's dress.
Really? I think its a really good accent and allows the bottom of the dress to flare nicely.
I just like the black straps on Jessica's dress more. I think its a much more subtle statement.
Yea it's nice, but I guess I just like more of a statement. I think belts look more professional
Exactly! This is red carpet not a business ball!
Yea I guess Jessica's dress does look more red carpet and Andie's looks more like a ball gown
I just think Andie's has to much fabric . The bottom looks heavy and plain.
Yea Jessica's dress is more slimming.
It's a more modern style too!
Well she is much younger
That's true, I think both dresses look beautiful given each individual's style, but I personally like Jessica's better
Yea I guess if I was to wear one I would probably wear Jessica's, I think they're both nice though.
They're probably both equally as expensive too
oh definitely! I couldn't wear them even if I wanted to
That scarlet color is really gorgeous and would look great on you though!
Yea I really love the color, it's extremely eye-catching
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which designer is Candace using for her wedding?
It's a French designer, but had never heard the name before now.
Do you know anything about her dress?
Its modern looking with some old world features.
What is old style about it?
First of all the fabric isn't current but more of this old fashioned lace.
So its not like a cleancut Vera Wang type look.
Right, the lines are modern but not totally clean.
Is there something else that stands out on the dress?
There's a little bustle and train on the back.
That's something.  Is she going to wear a veil?
Yes, one of those fingertip veils.
How does it look?
Its very simple with lace embellishment along the edges only.
What about the bridesmaids?
They'll be wearing long dresses.
Who is the designer?
The dresses are by Vera Wang.
What do they look like?
They're a raspberry color, pretty structured with a slit on the hem.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In your opinion, what is the most infamous dress worn by a celebrity at a red carpet event?
The green Versace dress that Jennifer Lopez wore to the 2000 Grammys.
At the time that dress created quite a controversy, but now it seems like severely low-cut dresses are commonplace.
What about when Courtney Love accidentally wore a Chanel knock-off to Paris Hilton's birthday party?
She was so embarrassed she wrote a letter of apology to Chanel, and later appeared in an article in Harper's Bazaar with the headline, "I'd rather go naked than wear fake Chanel."
I would like to see Courtney Love appear as a guest on one of these fashion reality shows.
Project Runway is one of the longest running, highly acclaimed reality shows out there.  Tim Gunn is such a beloved part of the show and a great mentor to the contestants.
I love the thoughtful fashion advice he gives in Marie Claire.
Does Marie Claire also have a column about plus-size fashion tips?
Yes, it's called "Fashion Advice for Curvy Women,"!
It's nice to see the majority of women represented in fashion magazines for once.
Ashley Nell Tipton was the winner of Project Runway season 14.  Not only was she the first contestant to show a plus-size collection, but she was the first contestant to win the grand prize with a plus-size collection.
It was so refreshing!  It's so nice to know that curvy girls can wear cute clothes too.  It's depressing to walk into most retail stores and see the tiniest sections dedicated to plus-size clothes.
And the clothes aren't very cute usually.
No, they're always off-the-shoulder or sheer-shoulder designs, or huge, flowing tunic tops that feel like tents.
Why can't plus-size fashion just look like regular fashion, but in bigger sizes?
I wish it wasn't called plus-size fashion at all, but simply, "fashion".  Ashley Nell Tipton bringing bigger women to the mainstream has made me more hopeful.
We have come a long way from Janice Dickinson refusing to interview any plus-size models for her show.
The bottom line is, in order to keep the fashion industry fresh and relevant, the majority of women need to be represented.
Maybe Tyra Banks will do a new season of America's Next Top Model, but with plus-size models!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the what has to be the cutest pants ever!
What are you babbling about, Jessica?
They are called Tying To See You Pants.
"Tying To See You Pants?"
They are  high rise  with a flare pants with a lace up detail on the side hip area.
Sounds interesting. Where did you say you saw them?
On a website.
Did you order a pair?
No.
Why not?
Because I ordered two pairs. One for you and  a pair for me.
Really? Thank-you, dear.
I ordered the top to match.
What does it look like?
It's made of the same fabric as the pants and has the same lace detail.
Does it tie up on the side like the pants?
I wish it did but it doesn't.
Where are the ties?
It ties up in the front. It's a sleeveless crop top.
I can't wait to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the best dressed at the Met Gala this year?
There were many choices, but I really liked Rihanna's outfit. It flowed with the theme. And those shoes! Wow!
She was very beautiful. Very different and stayed with the designer theme, Rei Kawakubo.
I agree completely. What did you think of Kim Kardashian's look?
It was definitely simple, white dress yet elegant. Her makeup matched perfectly with the dress.
I did not expect that from her at all. I thought it was a very interesting choice.
Yeah...I also really enjoyed Jennifer Lopez's dress! It had a certain flare and beautiful colors!
It was gorgeous! It reminded me a little bit of Elsa though from Frozen!
Haha! Yes. I guess it does have that characteristic.
What about Blake Lively's dress?? I adored her dress!!!
Can you remind me what she wore? I completely cannot recall...
She wore a plunging gold gown heavily embellished with fringe-style beading and blue feathers that cascaded down the train.
Oh my, that was gorgeous! Although I did not particularly like her sleeves, they hung too loosely and it made her arm a bit flabby.
I can see where you're coming from. I still love the feathers though!
Yes, those were great! Let's talk about Kendall Jenner...
Oh yes! What is there NOT to talk about? She was stunning!
Kendall always brings her A game. Those 85,000 crystals were to die for!
I was speechless when I saw her. Her shoes matched perfectly! Definitely a show stopper.
I loved this year's gala! I want to wear one of those dresses one day.
It was indeed amazing. I look forward to next year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Vera Wang's new dresses for spring?
I have! I always love her style; she's mysterious and dark while being trendy and fresh at the same time.
I agree, although I tend to be more on the mysterious and dark side of things, haha.
Haha, yeah, you do. What's your favorite dress in her new collection?
The long, silky black maxi dress with the lace at the neckline.
I knew you'd say that!
It can be dressed up or dressed down with accessories and shoes and I like multi-purpose clothing.
So do I!
What's your favorite of her new dresses this year?
The 1940s-inspired cream floral one, I think. It's long enough to be dressy but short enough to be fun.
I agree! I really like all three of the patterns in the 40s series this year.
Is the midnight blue and stars one your favorite?
Yeah, it is! You know me so well! Have you bought any yet?
No, I haven't. Besides, Vera Wang also has a set of silk camisoles out, so I couldn't decide what to get.
Really? I didn't know she designed camisoles!
She hasn't until this season. I think I might want to buy some.
Me too! Really versatile, it looks like. Of course, I love lace necklines.
We should go look at her new collection at the mall later!
I agree!
I love Vera Wang's style.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of this new ripped jeans look?
Ug, I hate it.
SO do I. It's like people are spending money to look ragged.
I don't let my kids buy stuff like that.
Neither do I and if their clothes do get ripped and I can't fix it we toss it out.
Don't do that. I can make quilts with the scraps.
I've always wanted to know how.
I can show you.
That would be great. I just got a lot of stained stuff out of Katie's closet this morning.
That means she needs new clothes then, right?
Yes. She's into all the new trends.
So are my kids.
We should go to the thrift store to find her some new stuff and we can get your kids something too.
That would be fun. I love thrift stores because you can get trendy clothes for less.
Some of that namebrand stuff is too expensive new.
I agree. I can't see paying those prices for a shirt.
Neither can I but I'll buy it used.
I have no problem with that either.
When do you want to go?
No time like the present I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you even start picking out a wedding dress?
It really depends on your style, there are so many these days!
I'm not sure what my style is, I suppose I want something that won't look super dated in the future.
Yeah that's really hard. I wonder if people in the 80's thought those poofy shoulders would look so dated like they do now?
I have no idea! They are are hideous though.
A-line is a very classic style that I imagine won't go out of fashion any time in the future.
You are probably right.
I would really avoid mermaid dresses for sure.
Yeah I don't like that style anyway. I had a friend that got one and she even said explicitly to me that she didn't want her dress to look dated either!
Yeah I can't imagine that would still be in fashion even ten years from now. The silhouette is just a bit strange looking.
I saw in stores that the fashionable thing now is showing a LOT of skin with see-through dresses.
Maybe in Italy! I can't imagine anyone wearing such a thing in the U.S. any time soon. We're too stuffy for such things.
I think you are right that an A-line would definitely be the best way at sticking with a classic style that won't look dated.
Luckily lace is coming back into fashion. Even though it goes in an out I think lace is a good idea if you like it.
I love lace! I think that would look great. Maybe even with a bit of sparkle.
Sparkles is always great! Just don't go too overboard. That gets scratchy feeling and you don't want to be uncomfortable!
That's a good point. What do you think of those high-low dresses? I've been seeing them more and more, even with wedding dresses.
I think they are really cute - but for a wedding dress? Maybe if you were having a beach wedding in Hawaii or something like that.
Yeah it would make a good destination wedding dress. I'll stick with the A-line like you mentioned. It's simple and classic.
Great decision. Lets go find the perfect one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you noticed all the colorful leggings at the lake?
Yeah. It's like all at once everybody suddenly got tired of black tights.
I liked throwing on my black leggings and going for a run. I didn't have to think about it.
Yeah, I see your point. But buying new exercise wear can be motivating too.
Yeah. You notice how good you look from all that exercise.
I'm not just exercising to look good. It's good for me!
Sure. Of course. But it's nice to look good too.
Yeah, you're right. And I guess leggings with a pattern would distract people from noticing some of my lumps and bumps too.
Yeah. Fabletics and Amazon both have leggings with absolutely blinding patterns.
Of course, some patterns actually make you look wider. Like horizontal stripes.
You're joking? They actually sell those?
Yeah. I don't know who buys them.
Blind people, maybe.
Really, really skinny blind people.
And of course compression leggings hold you in really well.
They do. I'm going to wear compression leggings with polka dots, once I lose five more  pounds.
You look fine now.
Maybe in leggings I do.
We both do. We're the queens of the lake.
Coming soon in brilliant living color.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Those dresses at the awards show were lovely.
Yes, and did you see the pant suit Sanaa Lathan wore?
Ye, it is just like the one I am working on now.
How have the sewing lessons been coming along by the way?
Great! MiMi is a fantastic teacher. She is teaching us so much about the art of sewing.
That's good. I can't wait for you to make something for your favorite sister.
Girl, you know I will.
Speaking of sisters, have you heard from Janice this week?
No, I haven't. She has not called since we saw her at the hospital.
I hope she is doing better.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Let's give her a call.
I have a better idea, let's take surprise her and take her shopping.
What is her favorite store agian?
Georgio Armani, hunny.
Oh yeah, how could I forget.
Especially after seeing her wear the brand for the last twenty years.
Yes, it's time for an upgrade.
Are you ready to shop?
Let's go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see any of the fashion at the met ball this year ?
Yes I seen a lot of it. It was less wild for the most part than last year.
You think so ? I though Rihanna's dress was insane!
I liked it ! It was wild but nothing last last years fashions.
I thought it was very ugly and silly.
It was a statement. Did you see Kylie Jenners dress?
Yes it was beautiful. But a copy of Beyoncé dress last year.
You think so ? I thought I stood out. Did you catch Sendyayas dress?
The yellow one ? It was stunning. Reminded me of a Chanel.
I love Chanel. Do you prefer Chanel to Michael Khors fashion ?
Of course. But Alexander McQueen is better.
I don't think so. But I do like the way he mixes patterns on his clothes.
I see a dress of his at a show. Back out. Long and flowly. It was so pretty.
I didn't see that. Don't you think backless is a little out of date ?
I a lot of stuff is coming back in style. Like the Olsen twins style at the met gala. Did you see it ?
I did. I didn't like.  Made me think they were the worst dressed.
I think solange Knowles was worst dressed. It was a sleeping bag. Black and silly
I may agree with you. Who do you think was best ?
I think Zendyaa. Her yellow flowing dress and her overall style was amazing.
I disagree. I give it to Nikki minage. Understand and simple. But elegant.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was in the bank yesterday, and the woman who helped me was wearing the most amazing shoes.
What were they like?
Well, to me they looked like something you'd wear to a dungeon. Black leather, tall heels, open toes, and a belt around your foot.
Oh, I've seen those. Like a belt you might see on a motorcycle jacket, with a big buckle.
Yes! A big shiny buckle. I wanted those shoes.
I think I want them too. But they can't be comfortable to wear to work all day.
No, probably not. But the woman I saw didn't care.
She probably put her feet up at lunch. Or went barefoot.
I'm amazed the bank let her wear those.
Yeah, not very corporate. I'd wear mine at night.
Well, it depends on your job, of course. Like if you sit all day, you could stand it, and nobody would see them.
Then you could dance in them at night.
Uhm, they're not really built for dancing, either.
Yeah, you might fall and hurt yourself.
You're already hurting yourself, just wearing them.
Hey, you can't wear running shoes all the time.
And heels look so elegant.
Sometimes fashion hurts. That's just the way it is.
Yeah. Somebody should make shoes that look good and feel good too.
That'd be a strange new look.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Check out those earings.
They're super cool. I love interesting earrings.
I want a pair like that.
It says here they came from Claire's so let's go look for some.
I love Claire's.
Me too. Their jewelry is great.
They have excellent hair accessories too.
I like those big claw clips.
So do I. I also like stretchy headbands.
You look cute in those.
Thanks. I love how they hold my hair in place.
I have an orange one you may have.
That one with the flower?
Yes, that.
I love that.
Well, I don't wear it so it's yours.
Thanks so much. If you like my butterfly earrings you can have those. I don't wear them.
I love butterfly stuff.
I know you do and it's not my thing really.
I love trading fashion accessories with you. It's fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of the brand ripndip?
Is that with the alien and the pockets?
Yes thats the one, do you like it?
I think its okay, its a little childish to me.
I think its supposed to represent being free, not connected.
Yeah i guess, do you know of any other brands?
I think the store h&m is very good, nice clothes
Yes! i've shopped there many times and i have a lot of clothing from them
I know, its a little more mature than ripndip i think.
I agree with that. H&m is more comfortable and easier to wear.
I think you should wear h&m if you are trying to dress casually
Well i think ripndip could be worn casually as well.
Yes i agree, whats your opinion on nike?
I love nike, nike is an anytime kind of clothing.
Absolutely. I wear nike almost all the time wherever i go.
i do not wear it THAT much, but it is good.
Have you thought about buying more clothes from them?
I think about it sometimes, but its so expensive.
yeah it is pretty expensive, you should buy it from a secondary source
i will try, thank you very much
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the dress that Kathi Lee wore on the Today show yesterday morning?
Yes, I liked the color.
Really?  I didn't like that color on the dress because I thought it was too bright.
No, neon and bright colors have made a big comeback.
I can't believe that neon is making a comeback
Yes, my teenage daughter owns lots of neon shoes and leggings.
It is weird how fashions from other decades make comebacks.
Yeah I remember when bell bottom jeans became popular again.
I actually saw Rihanna wearing a pair of bell bottom jeans to an award show recently.
Oh yeah I think I saw that show, she looked weird.
I know I saw an actress wearing a fishnet top in People magazine last week.
Oh no, I was hoping that style of top would never make a comeback.
What about those floral dresses I've been seeing around lately?
I think they are way too loud.
All those bright flowers on the new dresses look like they clash too much.
And what kind of sweater or shoes would you ever wear with something that looked like that?
I think you're supposed to wear solid colors with a print.
I really think Emma Watson dresses well.
I saw Emma Watson at a publicity event for Beauty and the Beast and she was wearing the most beautiful gold dress
She has really good fashion sense
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oo girl I like your skirt!
Uh I'm a dude. And it's a kilt
Really? You sure it isn't a skirt?
Yeah...you see the cargo pockets and epic on it?
It looks like a skirt to me
Nope definitely a kilt.
Well what's that fluffy purse on the front.
IT'S PART OF THE KILT
Still looks fabulous to me
It's a kilt!
Ok then what is that thing on your shoulder? A purse with pipes?
That's a bagpipe
What's that?
An instrument.
It looks like a super cute celtic purse.
It's an instrument.
So let me guess your socks are super manly too huh?
Yup got that right
So why are you wearing heels then?
Because they match my kilt!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen t 2017 New Womens Fashion Shoes Black Sexy high heel sandals? It's in black.
The heel that looks like it has your foot making the letter L?
Not exactly.
Yes, exactly. I saw that shoe and it made my foot hurt just by looking at it.
Those heels will go good with my red dress I just bought.
You may as well buy you some pain killers then.
Come on. You were heels.
I know but I don't wear heels over 3 inches and I definitely don't wear high heels that look they are going to cause problems for my feet down the line.
Well, I guess you're right now that I think about it.
I know I am right. I mean if it wasn't for the slight curve in them, they would form a straight L on your foot.
Yeah but they do look good on me.
I can't tell you what to do with your money. Buy them if you want them.
I just bought that High Low Formal Dress with those sandals heels in mind.
The dress with the flirty high low hem? That dress is so pretty.
I know. I saw an ad for it online and I had to order it.
I just saw an ad for it this morning and I was like I have to have it. Have you tried it on?
Yes!  It is so perfect. It hits me in all of the right spots.
With the way the hem goes from high to low, I bet that would be a great salsa dress.
Exactly. It would be perfect for a lot of twirling.
I need that dress in my life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of my new pants?
They look right on you.
Why do you say that?
They are. Is it hard to walk in those.
A little, but I like the way they look.
They do look nice. I like the rips over your knees.
There didn't come like that.
What happened?
As I was trying to put then on,I pulled them up fast and they tore like that.
Wow, they are poorly made.
Yes, but I like them.
Come to think of it, they do look nice.
I could look pass then looking tight. My girlfriend will like them.
Good luck
Thanks. What do you think of my shirt?
I like the country look on it. I just woke not tie it up in a knot.
Do you think my girl friend will like it?
No, torn pants and a tied up cowboy shirt. It's not  look your look with her.
I guess your right.
Do us both a favour.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your favorite trends right now?
It's so hard to say. I really like the look of the cold-shoulder top.
Really? I don't like that one as much.
Why not?
It just looks impractical, you know? Like why wear a long-sleeved top but have a bit cut out?
I guess I can see that. So what are your favorite trends?
I like the new trends in jeans.
With all the rips?
No, the shape--I like that it's more relaxed, not like skinny jeans.
Yeah, me too. Much more comfortable!
True. Anything you really don't like?
I don't really like the midi skirt--it's such an awkward length to pull off if you're not tall.
I agree. It makes my legs look really short.
What else don't you like?
Well, midi skirts, the cold-shoulder thing, and millenial pink.
I love millenial pink!
Why? It's so boring!
It's like a neutral, but more fun!
I guess so, but it's not for me.
That's fine--more millenial pink cold-shoulder tops for me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thought on he new UFC fight kits?
What do you mean , what changed from the last ones . I have honestly not been keeping p with anything
Well, let's see the fighters no longer have the ability to design their own figh gear, like the shorts or the womens tops
so what does the FC have in place now?
The company standardized the uniforms through a reebok deal to try to make the fighters a little more uniform and look like a legit sport .
are you telling me that the fighters no longer have the ability to add sponsers logos on the fight kits ?
yes , the sad part is that , through this new deal the fighter make less money because on average most of them would bottom out at around eighty thosand a fight for the sponsed gear.
That does not make any sense , not the fighters are getting paid less and have accepted a deal with reebok ?
yes
what do the kits look like ?
they have two types, in year one it was the fighters name on the shirt and the name on the shorts with a white on black colors and a triangle accent on the bottom of the fight kit .
whas there a reebok logo on it ?
of course !
what did the second generation look like ?
it was based on the same concept , but now it was more bolder colors instead of the whie acents, entire kits were designed to be yellow or green for brazil and all blue for the nited states . It basically took more of the white highlights from the first generation and replaced them with black.
do you have a pictre you can show me on your phone ?
yes, take a look !
These are ok but not the best design , why is there a monster logo on the champions fight kit ?
so the UFC can have hand selected brands to partner with reebok.
Thats so unfair but a really good business play .
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Jennifer Lawrence Dior handbag ad?
I'm not sure. Is that the one where she is wearing a white sweater?
Finally. Someone who also thinks her outfit was weird.
Baby, you are not the only one. What was that anyway?
While she is hanging it over the back of a white sofa. Yes that's the one.
I just love that black bag!
So do I, but my purse doesn't.
Tell me about. Designer prices are getting out of hand.
That small red bag she was holding in another ad has my name all over it.
The one in which she is wearing a pink sweater and that white coat?
Those outfits she was wearing in those ads are stunning.
Yeah, she can make dirt look good.
Did you notice that big bracelet she had on?
Yeah. I was wondering if it was real.
With all the money she makes, I bet it is.
I guess. It sure was big enough in any case.
What did you think of the sleeves on that shirt/ dress?
The kinda reminded me of bell bottoms.  I liked them.
I'm trying to remember if she was wearing any other jewelry in that ad.
I don't think she was. I just remember that huge gold looking bracelet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite brand at the moment?
I like this new brand I found called Trailing Nimbus.
I've never heard of them.
They make modern, sort of sci-fi stuff. They have a mix of Japanese style and afro-futurism going on.
That sounds very interesting.
Yeah, I like what they're doing quite a bit.
How did you find out about them?
I found their stuff on Tumblr actually.
That's funny. I didn't expect that.
Yeah, one of their shirts showed up on my timeline one day.
Are you getting sick of Palace and Supreme yet?
I don't know. They still put out good stuff.
Yeah, I guess. They're just so hyped up now.
I know what you mean.
I guess I still like feeling like I'm wearing something that everyone doesn't know about.
I'm sort of the same way. I like having unique clothes.
If something is good enough it will eventually been seen by everyone.
Right. The obscure stuff usually doesn't stay obscure forever.
Well, in the end I wear what I think looks the best.
I agree with that. It's about the clothes, not the brands.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like your shoes.
Thanks.
Where did you get them?
I got then at Ross.
Ross, really?
Yes. They had a huge she sale.
I like the red trim and the gold buttons.
I Know, they are cute.
How do they feel?
They feel okay for the first 6 hours.them me feet sell up.
Really? They look so comfortable.
They are, but for only a few hours.
Did they have more?
Yes they did.I also got a black pair.
I wish I could see those.
I'll ware them tomorrow for you.
Do they have a trim?
Yes, they are slow gold trim.
What sizes do they have?
All sizes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Dior's new fall campaign for 2017?
No but I bet Jennifer Lawrence is in it.
You nailed it.
She has been a model for Dior for a little while now.
They say the Dior Fall 2017 collection by Maria Grazia Chiuri captures Jennifer Lawrence just as she is.
What does that mean?
She's in a series of black and white photographs that were shot by some French photographer.
How do they look?
She appears to be both elegant and relaxed in the pictures.
Like she isn't being posed.
Yeah. The clothing she is wearing in the photos are said to correspond to her own personal style.
What is she wearing in them?
Jeans, t-shirt, a dark jacket, heels, some jewelry and a Dior handbag.
It could just be me but that doesn't sound like it would be pleasing to the eye.
If the jeans she was wearing in the pictures didn't look like they belonged on a man, I would have to say you're wrong.
But... I am not wrong am I? You didn't like the clothes she was wearing did you?
No.
They should have had her wear clothes that were more feminine.
Exactly. Those pictures failed in every way to me.
That's not good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the  sexy take on athletic/leisure clothing?
That's news to me. What is it?
It's called The New Athleisure.
The New Athleisure? What is it skin tight leggings with a top attached to it?
Something like that but not quite.
Well. Then what is it?
They say it is  a sexy take on  athleisure, with skin-skimming knits that outline every curve.
Sounds interesting. Do they come in an assortment of colors?
I saw some that were color-block bodysuits.
Do you remember what color it was? I like body suits.
I think one was like purple, black and blue.
Purple, black and blue? That does not sound like it will look good on me.
They had some cute sporty separates.
Sounds interesting.
I remember one being a pink top and pink bottom.
I like pink. I have a pair of pink heels I just love to wear.
I'm not sure if the bottoms were shorts or a skirt.
Well, either or is fine with me.
I don't think I like this new take on athleisure. I don't think my frame could pull them off wearing them.
Don't sell yourself short. You can make a potato sack look good.

Is it ok to wear stripes with different weights?
It is on some occasions.
How do you know when something makes fashion sense?
It's hard to say, and it depends on the person.
Can I wear brown shoes with grey pants?
You may be able to pull it off.
Can I wear grey shoes with brown pants?
That probably wouldn't look right.
Would it look bad to wear a black belt with brown shoes.
Probably but it could work based on the rest of the outfit.
Should I always wear black socks with black shoes?
Most of the time you should.
Should my watch match my outfit?
If you can make it match then it's a good idea.
Do my glasses need to match my outfit?
I recommend getting glasses that go with everything.
Can I wear boots with a dress?
A lot of the time that can be ok.
Should my purse match my outfit?
It should if you can find one.

I loved that feathered Jonathon Simkhai gown Hailey Baldwin was wearing to the Art of Elysium gala in January.
The orange one with the cut outs?
Yes, the burnt orange one with the cut out panels and the long skirt split.
Orange is really big in designer fashion lately.
I know, I saw Naomi Cambpell wearing the most gorgeous burnt orange Atelier Versace gown recently. It was covered in sequins.
I loved that one too. Did you see what she wore to the Golden Globe awards?
She wore two different dresses right?
Yes, she wore two lilac dresses for the award show and the after party.
I thought the lilac Versace gown that she wore for the red carpet was perfect for her.
I agree she knows her fashion. She always looks polished and beautiful.
Have you seen the new Balenciaga spandex boots?
I think so, those are the above knee boots that Miranda Kerr was photographed in?
Yes, she has the black ones but they also come in red and purple.
I don't know if I like them.
They are definitely different. Sometimes I am not a big fan of shoes or boots with a very pointed toe.
It depends. Sometimes a pointed toe can work and other times it just doesn't look right.
I prefer a classic riding boot most of the time.
I do too, but I can never seem to find a simple, classic riding boot that I like.
Have you looked online at frye, they have a lot of great styles.
I will definitely do that soon. Thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite purse designer?
Right now I like Michael Kors, how about you?
I am a big Louie V fan.
What store do you shop at the most?
I prefer Macy's, you?
I enjoy Nordstroms.  I really love the Ivanka line.
I do too!  I love everything Vera Wang.
I need to go to Toomey soon and get some new bags.
Yes, I just bought some from DVF.
I love her.  Where do you get your shoes?
I just go and look at DSW.  How about you?
I just bought some Audrina Pappil shoes from Macy's, they're gorg.
Oh, sounds nice.  I've had some Vincent Camuto shoes from there.
Those are great too, they last forever.
I have to be honest, target even has some great clothes.
Oh I know!  I love shopping for clothes at Target and Kohls.
It's just such a great deal you can't pass it up.
You're totally right.
Have a great day!
You too!

Hi
Hi, do you like fashion?
Yes I try and stay on top of the latest trends.
Me too, I just bought another romper.
Oh, I love rompers, I have one in black with pink flowers on it.
The one I just got is white, I love it. I got matching sandals too.
That sounds cute, I've been wanting a white romper.
I just got a pair of skinny jeans, with holes in them too, from Hollister.
I love their jeans, I have so many from there.
I prefer to wear summer dresses and rompers in the summertime.
I always wear jeans, sandals, and tank tops. It's my favorite fashion statement.
That sounds cute, I do it when I got out, but not all the time.
Sometimes I wear leggins, with a tunic, when I want to look cute, but comfortable.
I love leggings, I'm pretty sure I have a pair in every color.
I only have black and brown. I don't like the pattern ones.
I like them. I have these camp leggings and I have a super cute black shirt that I wear with them.
That sounds like it looks good. I wanted to get a geometric design once, but I couldn't find a shirt I liked with them.
To pull it off it has to be a solid color shirt, it can't have anythng on it
Yea, I have trouble finding solid color shirts I like.
I have a pink pattern leggings and I wear a solid white shirt. Love it.

Lauren Conrad just released a new line of clothes.
Saw that, I wonder if she will dip her toes into maternity clothes now that she is pregnant?
I bet she will. She seems really down to earth and her designs reflect that.
What's the name of her line again?
I think it's just LC Lauren Conrad
I just love the soft, flowing dresses she has out. I saw one at Kohls.
Me too! Did you happen to see how much it was?
It was more than $100 unfortunately.
Really? Most of her designs are pretty reasonable from what I've seen.
I think her fashion sense is no chic and beautiful
I agree! And very feminine.
Her jewelry is also really attractive. Very simple and elegant.
Have you seen some of her rings? They are to die for!
They are gorgeous but of course beyond my budget!
I did see a few tree-themed necklaces that were reasonable.
Oh? That sounds beautiful! Her bracelets are great, too.
Did you ever watch Lauren on "The Hills?"
All the time. Her fashion sense has evolved since then. But she has always been so chic.
I agree. I love how her line is designed for a simple girl.
Even though she has money! Love it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are brooches still popular?
I don't know but I still wear them.
I like to use them to keep my scarbes the way I want.
I do that and also just pin them on my shirts.
I remember seeing you wear a cute watermelon one the other day. That actually made me think of it.
That's my favorite one.
Where do you usually find them?
Usually secondhand stores.
Like the one down the street?
I've gotten at least ten there.
I'll have to get some then. Do they have scarves?
Usually tons.
I love scarves.
Me too and they are good with brooches.
I think so too.
That's all that matters.
I love how you don't get hung up on trends.
Who knows? We might set our own.
Maybe.
Wear what you like. Don't worry so much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am thinking of starting a fashion line.
Will it be like the Apple Bottoms brand?
No, I was thinking of a line modeling the Chanel brand.
I love Chanel. Everything is so classy and elegant.
I especially love the idea of the pearl.
Yes, I once had a beautiful pink Chanel peal necklace.
I remember that necklace.
Do you think you could replicate that design?
I would have to see a picture of it to do a replication.
I think i have a picture right here in my phone.
I could create one without looking at the picture.
How would you do that?
I could just get the pearls and string them into a beautiful style that's my own.
That sounds like a great idea.
You would surely need a dress to go with the pearls.
Would you be able to design the dress as well?
I sure would, I could use you as a model for all of my designs.
I would be honored.
It is my pleasure.
When can we start?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you make that purse?
I did. It's made from a T shirt I cut and sewed.
It's so cute.
I sell them at flea markets sometimes.
I want to learn to do that.
I will show you. You can use any shirt.
I have a few old ones that are frayed.
That's fine. It's a good way to reuse as well so you don't waste things.
Could I use this plaid shirt?
Yes.
I love this but it's messed up so I'd like to make a bag out of it.
We can do that right now if you have the thread and stuff.
I have that right here.
OK, well let's get started.
Do those bags sell well?
It depends. Some people really like them.
I've never seen one like it before.
I got the idea online.
I just want the plaid one for myself.
Let's start on it now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the gowns at the Met Gala this year?
I did! Who was your favorite?
I thought that Rihanna looked amazing. She wore the designer being honored, you know.
She did make an impact, but her look was too much for me. I preferred the simpler looks, like Gisele.
But the designer is all about crazy looks, and Gisele was so boring!
Simple, but not boring! Her metallic gown was so beautiful.
No, I still think that it was boring. Who were some of your other favorites?
Dakota Johnson looked beautiful too.
I don't remember her look. What did it look like?
She wore a black dress with these shoulders that puffed up.
Oh, right, I remember that one now. That was a nice look too.
Who were your other favorites?
I thought Zendaya looked amazing--not as outrageous as some, but her dress made a bold statement.
I don't remember her. What did she wear?
She wore this orange gown with giant parrots on it.
That sounds interesting. Did you see Solange?
I did! She looked like she was wearing a giant sleeping bag, but it was fun.
You're right, it did look like a sleeping bag!
Some of the looks were really crazy this year.
Yes, some of them really were.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is coming into fashion?
In what time frame?
This Spring.
I think vibrant colors are in.
What is out?
I think grey and black.
How about fabric type?
That will stay the same.
Is there a demegraphic that the designers are targeting?
The same as it always is.
Who do they always target?
Teens and young adults.
Why are they targeted?
They are impressionable.
Is that the only reason?
No, they also have money.
What does that demographic spend money on now?
Mostly athletic goods.
Any wild predictions for the future?
Shorter shorts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite at the Golden Globes last night?
Hmmm, tough question....I would have to go with Jennifer Garner!
Ohhh, good choice. She looked simply stunning in that red Vera Wang gown, didn't she?
Amazing is more like it!
And Emma Watson! Her shoes were just killer!
They were! I don't know how she even walked in heels that high, but she pulled it off flawlessly!
I noticed another trend on the carpet last night too didn't you, in regards to the colors?
Oh yes, jewel tones ruled the night didn't they? Reds, purples, blues and greens. It was enchanting to say the least!
Such a romantic old Hollywood feel I thought.
Oh yes, definetly!
And what were your thoughts on the gentlemen's attire?
The ladies were the talk of the night, but I felt like the men did their job as well.
So many stylish suits and smart accessories I thought. Leonardo DiCaprio comes to my mind first, he was so suave, was he not?
Swoon! I agree, so many dashing men to complement all of the fancy gowns and ladies.
I would call that another successful night in the books, wouldn't you?
Oh yes, 100%! I can only imagine how hard it will be to top the fashion of this years awards next year!
Oh, i'm sure it will be done. That's one thing I have learned about Hollywood, it's not one to be outdone. Even by itself!
Haha! Oh yes, I can't wait!
Until next year then!
Have a great night everyone!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the worst dressed at this year's Met Gala
Caroline Kennedy, hands down
Why do you say Caroline was the worst dressed.
Although she stuck to the theme, the dress was simply unflattering on her.
A agree. What made it unflattering to you?
It just seemed way to large for her body frame.
Yes, I agree. It really overpowered her.
Right. I hated her shoes as well
They were like little black pilgrim shoes
Yes. Reminded me of the same shoes the Wicked Witch of the West wore in The Wizard of Oz
Yes. They were not very complementary to her dress.
Her hair was not complementary to the dress either.
I agree. Neither was her makeup. Very plain.
It didn't seem like her hair and makeup were done at all.
Right. She just put on the dress and figured that was enough, I guess.
I would have liked to see her in something with less volume.
I agree. One of the more slenderizing designs of Rei Kawakubo would have been nice.
Yes. Caroline is tall and slim. I think a drop waist design would have worked better
And better shoes
Yes. A nice pair of stilettos would have looked nice instead of pilgrim heels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How come 90's fashion is coming back?
Right?! I thought I would never see this come again.
Honestly. It's the worst.
I know. I saw a velore shirt the other day.
Well, I saw raised sandels.
I don't know what peeople are thinking
It's not like the stuff was cute even when we were wearing it.
I know!!! I don't care what anyone says. Those boob stripe shirts were awful.
Or how about wearing dresses that literally looks like lengire?
God! That was a terrible look.
Can't believe our parents let us do that.
It was the in thing to do.
Why do they have to bring it back though?
Next thing you know we will all be looking like we just came off the set of Buffy
Lord, please no.
Lisa Frank will come back into style.
Can you even imagine?
Everyone walking around looking like crap
Someone has to do something.
You first.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite trend from the 90s?
It would probably be wide-legged jeans.
Did you wear them often?
Yeah, I wore them all the time.
What was your favorite brand?
JNCO.
Where did you buy them?
Usually at either Hot Topic or Gadzooks.
Wow, I remember those places. Do people even go to the mall anymore?
I doubt it.
Do you still have any of your 90s clothes?
I have a couple shirts, I think. My mom got rid of most of my things when I moved out.
Oh, that's too bad. I don't really have anything anymore, either, except a Tommy Hilfiger coat.
Oh yeah? That might be worth some money. It's vintage.
I'll have to check to see on eBay.
Let me know what you find out.
So what's the worst 90s fashion trend you can think of?
Guys in skirts.
Really? I thought they were kind of hot.
That's because you're gay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why are all these guys wearing denim shorts all the sudden?
Who knows probably some hipster trend.
Yeah I think its definitely a trend too but why
Someone in Hollywood did it first.
Who?
No idea but where do all trends emanate from?
The internet I would say
That may be true but mostly from TV
Well it looks terrible
Its not just that they are cutting their jeans apart
So then instead of buying shorts they are buying jeans
Which are more expensive
No one said guys know fashion
Its not just that, they dont know how to dress nor save a dime.
Well money has nothing to do with it
Sure it does, a look for less?
Yeah that sort of makes sense
So the jeans have to have a distressed look
You know someones going to attack that style soon
I think Abercrombie is already profiting off of it
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Christian Dior's  Haute Couture Spring Summer 2017 fashions ?
I thought they were very dreary.
What about the fashions did you find dreary ?
Most of the models at the fashion show for that line were dressed all in black.
What did you think about the way the clothing fit the models at the fashion show ?
The clothing seemed to fit awkwardly on the models.
Did you feel Dior's  Haute Couture Spring Summer 2017 was inspired ?
Now I thought it was edgy for the sake of edginess.
How was it edgy for the sake of edginess ?
It was like a 5 year old designed the clothing using colored pencils and construction paper.
What about Dior's  Haute Couture Spring Summer 2017 seem childish ?
The way the clothing was sized so oddly.
Do you think the  Haute Couture Spring Summer 2017 fashion show had a Halloween feel to it ?
Yes it was like riding in the haunted mansion at Disneyland.
Did you find any of the  Haute Couture Spring Summer 2017  Dior collection practical to wear for the average person ?
Not it was just ridiculous clothing for rich people who have run out of things to do with their money.
Overall what did you think of the Dior  Haute Couture Spring Summer 2017 collection ?
It was the clothing you would imagine one would wear to a funeral ?
What creeped you out the most about the Dior  Haute Couture Spring Summer 2017 ?
The ugly little mask the models wore during the fashion show.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the best dressed at the Met Gala this year?
Rihanna hands down in Comme Des Carons.
yes, I loved her dress, hair and those shoes were to die for.
What did you think about Solange Knowles?
I was not loving that puff coat at all..lol.
Yes, I agree  I felt it was one of the worst looks for the evening.
What about Katy Perry in that red netting?
lol...yes that dress was a bit much.   I did not like it at all.
What about best dressed male?
I would have to say P Diddy.
I agree, he looked really nice and he knew it..lol
Yes, did you see him lying across the stairs while Cassie was taking pictures?
Yes, I saw him, he is too much.
Which male did you feel was best dressed?
Joe Jonas looked pretty dapper in his tux.
yes, I agree he look really good in that tux
Were there any badly dressed men?
I actually liked what the men were wearing.
I thought Wiz Khalifa even looked nice is those flooding pants...lol
yes, those pants were a bit short.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I must be getting old. I can't wear that new style of ripped jeans.
Me too. I keep thinking that I don't want to catch a draft.
When I was younger, I wore my jeans until they did that naturally.
Right. Who wants to spend $80 to look like that?
Obviously plenty of people want shredded jeans.
Some people will fall for any fashion trend.
I think young people have a lot of disposable cash.
They don't think about savings, just about showing flesh.
Hey, we showed flesh back in the day.
Yeah, 30 pounds ago, I had that sweet vintage dress.
The one you bought in San Francisco?
Exactly. It was pretty see-through.
It was very radical, even for the time.
I wonder where it is now? I gave it to a consignment shop.
Now there's something we haven't done i ages - gone to a consignment shop.
The last time I looked, everything seemed to be from the 1970s. No thank you.
I see what you mean. Let's go downtown and browse around.
I'd like to visit Kate Spade.
Yeah, I think we could find something age appropriate there.
Yes, the styles are pretty classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I signed up with a company that sends me clothing by mail once a month. I try it on and keep what i want, am billed for it, and send back what I don't.
Oh I've heard about that. I keep seeing ads for them on facebook, but I wasn't sure if the clothes would be all that special.
I usually keep about 3 out of 5 of the items they send me. Do you want to see what i got last month?
Yes I would, that way I can see if it is something I would do or not.
Alright, look at this striped shirt. I normally would never choose horizontal stripes but the cut of the blouse is very flattering.
Oh I like it. It looks like a summer top that I would pair with high waisted pants.
This top reminds me of old Hollywood for some reason. It is very high quality as well.
Nice! I am begining to like this company now.
Now, let me show you the next item, which is a longer tunic with large cutouts in the back.
It looks kind of boring.
The tunic is very plain in front but look as I turn around and you will see why I love it so much.
Oh I see, the large cutouts in the back. It is very sexy and pretty much shows your bare back.
This is something I would wear to go out in.I haven't decided what to pair it with though.
If it were me, I would just wear either black or white denim shorts.
Now I am going to show you the cutest pants in the world. These are almost like leggings but they have real pockets.
I can see why you love them.
I honestly don't see maroon pants every day. I like the color but the fit is a little off.
Yeah, they are a little short and loose around the bottom.
Well, those are the three items I kept from last months fashion box. What do you think?
They are nice but I don't think the service is for me. I enjoy shopping and picking clothes out to match my own personal style.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How's your dress making business going?
Surprisingly it's going OK. I've had five orders this month.
You designed that black and white one June wore to the prom, right?
Yes. I got the design idea from one I saw on an awards show.
That one was beautiful.
Thanks. It was a little hard to do the skirt with all those ruffles and such but I loved how it turned out.
It was really beautiful. I've been thinking of ordering something for myself to wear to a fancy charity event I have to go to.
We can do that any time you'd like.
The thing is I know the color I want but that's it.
I can help you design it, though, any time.
I also want lace. i love lace.
That's no problem either. What color were you wanting?
A soft pink I think.
You'd look so great in that.
With either white or a darker pink lace.
I have both colors of lace right now.
I'm pretty excited about this now.
Want to start designing it now?
Absolutely.
OK. Let's go through patterns and do that then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about this leggings craze?
I think leggings are fantastic when worn as leggings, not as pants.
With so many companies using marketing sales and pop up stores do you believe they are all the same?
I think some companies like LuLu Roe and Buskins have great quality products but there's a lot of copy cats with poor quality.
What body type is best for leggings?
I think all body types are good for them as long as the style is coordinated right. Anyone can pull them off with the right top!
I happen love my Buskins because of the price, free shipping benefit, and they aren't sheer at all.
Yeah, I have seen some amazing prints also. My favorite are the aztec designs.
I really think there should be more options for the plus sized girls when it comes to bottoms so this trend is perfect.
It's funny how popular they've become and how fast these companies have grown.
Yeah, I remember as a little girl just wearing "tights" and a dress. I had no idea they would evolve into what they are today!
It's not a bad thing for sure. I just don't like when people wear them as pants with a top that doesn't cover their butt or thighs.
They do need to be worn with a tunic or dress, I agree.
Which is better to go with them? Boots or sandals?
Some I wear with sandals but mainly boots and a short dress. It gives it that edgy look.
Speaking of boots! Best brand?
Dr. Martens of course!
Omg you and I are too much alike.
Most people think they are outdated.
No way! They will never go out of style just like leggings won't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of fashion?
Are you talking to me?
Yeah! You! What do YOU think of fashion?
Its alright, I suppose. I haven't given it much thought.
But fashion drives our culture!
Its just pants.
Its more than just pants, you are just apathetic, you bum.
The way I see it, if a mans got pants, hes got all he needs to make his way in the world, and this whole fashion business is overrated.
Wow, I never stopped to think of it like that.
Clearly not. What do YOU think of fashion?
Well I used to care about looking cool, but after what you said...
See, fashion really doesnt matter.
I don't know what I'm going to do with my life now.
Go forth, and enjoy your pants. Its what your mother would want.
But could I really enjoy my pants without seeking others approval?
Your pants are nobody elses business but your own.
Wow, thank you. That really is a great weight off my shoulders.
My pleasure.
I am pleased to have met you, what do you do for a living?
OH me? I'm a bum.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been to any good fashion shows recently?
I have. I was lucky enough to attend Louis Vuitton's show in Japan.
You mean the Louis Vuitton show in the Japanese mountains?
Yes. It was amazing.
Did you see anyone famous there?
I saw Michelle Williams. She looked absolutely fabulous.
What do you think of Louis Vuitton's latest stuff?
Very interesting. I'm not sure I would buy any of it myself.
Why not? I thought you loved Louis Vuitton.
The hemlines are getting shorter and shorter. That's not my style at all.
I've noticed you've been wearing more Gucci these days.
I know. I bought my Gucci handbag in London last year.
Beautiful handbag. How much did that cost you?
Literally thousands. But the bag will keep its value.
Would you ever sell it?
If I was to get a new one, perhaps.
But then don't you just love building a collection of bags?
Yes, although I don't have room for them all.
Can I borrow your new Gucci handbag sometime?
Of course, just let me know when you need it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In my personal opinion, fashion is not a bad thing.
I totally agree with you, a fashionable person looks smart and usually attractive.
Unfortunately some people spend too much time on choosing their clothing or makeup rather than to focus on other important things.
It is important to keep priorities, nevertheless a fashion done within a limits is certainly something positive.
It is important though to remember that fashion does not only relate to clothing.
But clothing is the most significant aspect of the fashion, thats why during very important events celebrities try to look as attractive as possible.
Yes, you are right, however some of them are taking the fashion too extreme when trying to grab reporters` attention.
This is because fashion is now adopted everywhere. The celebrities are the ones who are an example for different people to what is currently fashionable.
Well, I agree with you. Students for instance tend to spend all morning to make sure they will follow the latest fashion, oftenly forgeting about the rest of the world.
But remember that fashion also gives them a sense of individuality. It allows them to express their inner selves.
You mean that girls wear colorful dresses like for instance, beautiful butterflied?
This is exactly what I meant. In addition, boys also try to do their best to look like famous actors.
But in that situation, people do not express their inner selves, but try to become someone they really like.
I guess you are actually right, but remember that some people will follow and some people will lead in terms of fashion. There will always be someone to express their fashion which then other people will copy. Fashion sells relaly well, therefore celebrities try to stand out of the rest, even when it means to be the topic of controversion.
Once you have mentioned the controversion. What do you think of women who cut off all their hair in order to be bald, or who pierce their bodies in a multiple places.
I do think that this is an element of perosnal fashion, but as we have said before, there has to be a limit. If a woman decides to shave a part of their head and knows why, it should look quite attractive, same goes for piercing.
I agree with you about the limits in terms these fashion areas, in my personal opinion too much piercing decrease the natural beauty of the person significantly and may even cause some health problem, like infections.
Yes, some people do not understand the risks and take anything that stands in their way of being fashionable.
How about jewelry, I see that you wear a diamond necklace. Do you think jewelry is also an important part of fashion?
Jewelery hmm? I wear this particular necklace because i stronly believe that it outlines the aspect of luxury as a part of my fashion. There are different types of jewerly like bracelets or even jewelry based on piercing. I think it is extremely important to add tiny jewerly aspects to our personal fashion styles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That's right! I absolutely loved the flared look and think it was very fitting for her body type.
Right, along with her simple yet stunning necklace and shoes that might have been my favorite look!
Oh those shoes were gorgeous!  Do you remember what designer they were from?
I'm not sure, I don't really remember other than it looked great!
Agreed.  I also loved her partner's look also.  It was a perfect compliment to the dress.
Could you imagine how long it took for them to get ready?  Or how many outfits they had to look at before they decided on, "the one?"
I couldn't even imagine.  How fun would that be?
Right.  Black is such a nice, elegant color for a red carpet occasion, how could you go wrong?
Kate Hudson's Giorgio Armani suit was also stunning and such an eye catcher.
Totally agree.  Her simple hair style complimented it in such a way.  It was simple yet so gorgeous.
I don't know how she can pull of a suit like that, but I wish I could!
Haha.  Right?  The details were so ornate.
Her shoes also complimented the outfit.  Simple tan.  How does she walk in those?
No clue.  But after standing on the red carpet for a couple hours I bet she was ready to take them off.
If I were to wear a gorgeous Armani suit with those shoes and looked as good as she did, I don't think I'd ever take the outfit off.
Totally agree.  It actually looked pretty comfortable.  More comfortable than wearing a super tight dress or something that barely covers the body.
Jennifer Aniston always looks so timeless on the red carpet too.
Yes!  She never has a bad look. Always so elegant, confident, and beautiful
I feel like Jennifer could walk down the red carpet in jeans and a T shirt and everyone would still love the look.
Haha.  Seriously though.  I need some fashion advice from her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of how Rachel Maddow looks on her show?
I don't like what they are doing with her hair. Or her makeup
Oh, me either. I like gray hair.
And she has on way too much makeup right?
Yes! It's like they're trying to make her look straight.
Straight and not old. Because society fears older women who don't want to sleep with men. or who men don't want to sleep with.
She still looks great though
Yeah, I love her suits.
At least they haven't made her wear dresses yet
OR blouses or something feminine
I like the kinds of things Ellen wears on her show too
Yeah, but even with her sometimes they try to make it too feminine
Right I understand that it's television and all, but we can bring gender neutral clothing into the mainstream
Yeah, i don't even mind overtly feminine or masculine clothing. But it feels like most people are somewhere in between on the spectrum.
Yes! There are so many in between people. I wish they would show that more on television.
I like Mary Carillo's outfits as well. It's mostly pantsuits, but they fit her well.
I like Mary Carillo's hair.
Yes. It is a good cut for her
I used to not like skinny jeans, but they've grown on me.
Oh, me too. If they fit well, they are nice.

My grandmother is 67, and she still cares about fashion.
Why not?
I agree. She spends a half hour on her make-up, faithfully, though she's retired and doesn't go out much. And shops every season.
What does she wear?
Coldwater Creek styles mostly. Nothing bare, nothing revealing, though. Soft, drapey clothes.
I like their clothes too. Sort of an arty feel.
Yes, she's pretty arty. And she believes certain colors and shapes flatter her, and is careful to choose them.
I should do that. I just grab what I need for whatever occasion, whatever's new and stylish.
She's pretty stylish, actually, in her own way.
I bet you wouldn't see her in Topshop or Modcloth.
Well no. But she appreciates that kind of thing though. She enjoys fashion in all its forms.
That's so sweet.
She's pretty sharp, actually. And she feels free to comment on other people's clothes, too.
She complements them.
Not always. She doesn't like underwear to show, for example, and she'll tell a grandchild so  directly.
You mean like bra straps.
Or boys' underwear that shows above their pants. That wasn't her idea of style!
I think showing your underwear is out of fashion anyway.
Around her it always was.
I don't know. If it's summer, and you're wearing a pretty camisole...

Which designer designs the best handbags?
It is hard to say. I like so many of them.
Yeah, so do I. I really like all of Dooney & Bourkes hand bags.
So do I but Anuschka's hand painted leather bags are so unique.
Aren't they? I have never seen anything so stunning.
The pretty one with the pink flamingos. I really need that bag.
But the white, square shaped one with the butterflies and the short handle.
Yeah, the one with roses.
Exactly. The purple and pink roses.
That handbag is killer.
The Givenchy Antigona Bag with leopard print and beige handles is nice.
The one Jada Pinkett Smith owns? I know exactly which one you are talking about.
That bag is expensive and the plus it too box like to me.
You want to talk expensive. The Fendi Petite 2Jours is expensive and box like.
I know it. It looks like you are carrying  a small box.
Most of Fendi Petite 2Jours look like boxes on your arms.
Now, they have some cute colors.
True. But I refuse to pay that kind of money for what looks like a small box hanging from a strap.
Yeah. Tell me about it. Although the owl looking ones so gorgeous.
I know. I especially like the one with the pink beak.

Who is your favorite supermodel?
Bruna Tenorio is my favorite.
I've never heard of Bruna Tenorio. What is she like?
She's a gorgeous exotic waifish Brazilian model with a long neck.
Kate Moss was my favorite waif model. Adriana Lima is my favorite Brazilian model.
I like Adriana too. Bruna is just not that famous.
What about American models? Which American ones do you like?
For the 1970s models, I like Janice Dickenson. She was so exotic.
Janice was gorgeous. Marisa Berenson was my favorite from that decade though.
Wait, I change my favorite. I forgot about Iman.
Oh yes, Iman was stunning like a queen.
Yes, she's my favorite 1970s model. Wait though, you wanted me to name Americans.
It's okay. You can name Somalian models.
Talking about African models, I love Liya Kebede for a modern-day model.
Where in Africa is Liya from?
She's from Ethiopia. I think she did Revlon ads.
I wonder if Iman did Revlon ads. I did see her back in the 90s promoting her make-up line at the mall.
Yes, I remember that make-up line. It was a line geared to minority skin tones.
Yes, I guess Iman's line was like MAC.
I heard MAC make-up caters more to diverse racial and ethnic skin tones compared to other make-up lines.

How do you like my shoes?
They are fabulous.
Thanks, I actually found them online.
How interesting, what do you think about shopping online?
I think it is just wonderful, like look at these shoes
Where you able to save?
Why yes I was about to save about twenty percent
Now tell me where did you get your hat?
Well this was a gift from my mother in law, she got it from Spain for me.
It almost looks ca-tour
Really I think it's just supposed to be a sun hat.
Yes a shear fashion statement.
Are you saying you don't like it?
No not at all, it's just great.
So what do you not like about the hat?
It just pushes all the wrong buttons.
How come you think that, I think it is just fabulous
It's not, you have no taste for wearing such a thing.
Well we will have to agree disagree
I agree but all praise be to the fashion gods.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the cold shoulder trend?
I love it! It is so summery and feminine
Yes, I especially love dresses and pretty blouses in that style.
I saw so many floral cold shoulder dresses on sale that day.
Did you buy anything?
Yes, I bought a floral long dress with cold shoulder from Zara.
It sounds lovely. Was it on sale?
Yes it was on sale.
Did you buy any accessories to go with it?
Yes, I bought a strappy sandal and a chunky necklace.
I think chunky necklaces or long dangly earrings will go so well with that style.
Yes, I agree.
I saw a pretty denim off shoulder blouse that day.
Did you buy it?
No, it was rather expensive.
You should check out Target. I saw some off shoulder blouses there too.
I will go have a look later. I will also look out for skinny jeans.
Skinny jeans and off shoulder go very well.
I think it is chic look.
Definately. I love that look.

This year's theme for the 2017 Met Gala was Japanese fashion designer Rei Kawakubo's vision of Comme des Garçons.
Yes, Rihanna, who is known for embracing the Met Gala themes in their entirety stunned in an avant-garde Comme des Garçons outfit with lace up sandals by Dsquared 2.
My favorite look of the night was Gigi Hadid's asymmetrical Tommy Hilfiger gown.
The dress embraced the masculine tailoring and structure of Comme des Garçons on one side and was sultry and elegant on the other.
The champagne color of the Hilfiger dress really complemented her olive skin tone.
My favorite look of the night was Blake Lively's feathered Versace gown.  This dress was made for her!
The two-toned indigo feather fish-tail train gave this dress a spectacular flair.
She reminded me of an exotic bird as she graced the red carpet.
I was really disappointed at the Kardashian's and the Jenner's this year.  None of the dresses they chose met the theme nor were they showstoppers.
I actually think that Kim Kardashian-West was a bit under dressed this year.  She wore a white corseted Vivienne Westwood gown and strappy sandals which was a far cry from the sparkling silver Balmain gown she wore in 2016.
I liked Kylie Jenner's pink floral illlusion dress, but it is a look that we've seen hundreds of time before.  There was nothing original about it.
But that wasn't the biggest fail of the evening.  Madonna's camo Moschino gown stood out for all the wrong reasons.  It wasn't a fashion moment.
The camo gown was just a poor choice and it didn't fit the moment.  I can't think of an event where a camo dress is haute couture.
Katy Perry's Maison Margiela gown was a miss as well.
I think the saying goes, "too many accessories clutter an outfit."  This look had bad horror film written all over it.
My other favorite looks of the night were Rita Ora's red Marchesa gown and Zendaya really stunned in the gorgeous satin Dolce & Gabbana off the shoulder gown.
The hair, the makeup, Rita Ora definitely stole the show!
She was an elegantly wrapped feast for the eyes even though her dress didn't really gel with the theme.
This was a complicated theme so many guests just aimed for their best fashion.
I agree.  Now, I can't wait until next years' Met Gala!

You have been wearing a lot of pink lately, Sammie.
Yes, that is because pink is in this year.
I thought green color was in this year. What do they call it?
They are calling it "Greenery".
That's right.  It is all the shades of green.
Yeah. I don't like wearing green and that is why I am wearing pink.
Why don't you like to wear green? A green top with a pair of black slacks would look good on you.
Green makes me look like Kermit the Frog.
No you didn't just say that. Really?
I am serious. I have pictures of me wearing green during my junior year in high school.
It has been nearly ten years since you were in high school.
Yes. I used to wear that green jumpsuit all of the time.  I know you remember it.
It was cute.
I looked like I was a human frog.
It wasn't that bad.
Yes it was. I used to get picked on everyday because of that jumpsuit.
I didn't know. I thought it was cute.
So did I until I looked really hard in my mirror.

I love that wedding dress. Look at those pearl beads.
I wonder if they're real. They're so pretty.
They really are.
I'd love to have a dress like that when I get married.
I want one with a tight top and a poofy bottom. I love that shape.
Me too. It makes your waist look so small.
What color would you want? I want white.
Me too. I just feel like wedding dresses need to be white.
It seems weird to me when they're not.
Yep. My cousin had a pink one and I thought it was.
Not ugly but weird.
Right. To each his own but I'll stick with white.
Would you want beading like those pearls?
Yes, probably, or crystals maybe.
I think pearls are so classy.
They are. I love how they never go out of style.
True. They go with so much, though.
I even wear pearls with jeans.
I've done that too.
We should both wear that combo tomorrow.

Hi there
Hey
Do you think want to talk about fashion?
Sure I love fashion, what's your favorite thing to wear?
I love holy jeans and tank tops
Skinny or flare
Skinny, I like to wear boots in the winter and sandals in the summertime
That's cute. I like to wear dresses in the summer
I'm not a dress person.
I love dresses, I like they are cute, and cool in the summer too
I wear jeans all year round, I can't get enough of them. I have so many pairs.
I only have a few.
What do you wear when it's cold
I like leggings and oversized sweaters, and boots. It's so comfy
That sounds cute, I wear leggings sometimes.
I have them in almost every color, I have the thermal ones toi
I've never worn the thermal leggings, I've been wanting to try them
They are so warm, warmer then jeans.
Wow, I need to get some then
You really do. There amazing.

Have you seen the new loot crate clothing options, yet.
I haven't but im definitely interested in checking that out, i love their shirts.
Me too!  I bierfly checked it out but it looks pretty good.
Cool, what all can you sign up for.
Umm, i think there was one just for t-shirts and sweat shirts.
Nice, id probably get that one.  Did they have one for the socks.
They did, that was one i was thinking about getting, i love the harry potter and star wars socks i got.
I didn't get the harry potter ones but i have the star wars bb8 ones, they are so cute.
Thats a bummer the harry potter one had all the holecruxs on it.
Darn i would have really liked that i will have to check out ebay and see what they are going for.
Lootcrate also had a wearable one for the ladies.
O thats good, what stuff comes in that one.
I think it has purses, necklaces, and other stuff like that.
My sister would love that im going to check out that one too.
Ya i was thinking about getting it for a friend for her birthday, the prices arent too bad if i remember correctly.
O ya are they the same price of the crates?
No i believe they are a little cheaper.  Like 12 to 15 bucks a month.
Thats pretty reasonable, i think im going to go check out lootcrates site right now.
Alright, take it easy and let me know what you get.
If i had the money id get them all, lol.  talk to you later.

What do you think of the trend towards bell bottoms?
My mother said she used to wear them in the 70s and they were very comfortable.
Did she keep any of them?
No, but she said all the high school girls were wearing them.  She said the style made your legs look long.
I heard the trend started in England and the model named Twiggy made them popular.
Yeah, Twiggy was one of the first super models.
Twiggy was also known for making the 'mode' dress popular.
Yes, and also for big big fake eyelashes.
I'm not keen on all 'flower power' designs though on the clothes from the 70s.
Me neither.  The current style bell bottoms don't have crazy flower patterns on them.
Yes, that makes them more versatile.  I saw Goldie Hawn wearing bell bottoms in a magazine.  She looked great.
Her daughter Kate Hudson has a fashion brand called Fabletics.
I have seen the commercials.  Talk about crazy patterns!  But the patterns look good on the exercise leggings.
True.  And the patterns are strategically placed so they make the wearer look slimmer.
The fabric is comfortable.  I have a pair and love them.
Do they wash well?
Very well.  They retain their shape.
Can you put them in the drier?
Yes but I don't like to.
I think it is better to hang dry most clothes so they don't fade.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How's your jewelry business going?
I'm selling quite a bit.
What do you make?
Necklaces and earrings. I buy materials and also repurpose old jewelry.
Did you make that necklace with all the trangles on it?
Yes. I went to the store and it seemed like all the jewelry had triangles. I had to get in on the trend.
I like that but haven't seen the triangle jewelry at stores.
It was really prevalent.
Do you have a Facebook page?
Yes. If you want I'll invite you to it.
Good. I want to buy some flower earrings for my mom.
I have roses and otus flowers right now but am getting some others soon.
I might get the roses.
Those are popular. I don't have many left so let me know soon.
Do you have a pic of them on hand?
It's this.
Those are amaing. I will get earrings.
I can make them today.
I can't wait. I'll advertise your page for you too.
Thanks so much.

What are you going to wear to the festival this year?
I'm not sure. I want to be fashion forward but...
But what?
I don't really like many of the new trends this Spring?
What? I'm obsessed
I'm a little more preppy, and this Spring's styles are a little too boho for my taste.
I'm obsessed with the lace and embroidery.
Yeah, that's not my thing.
Floral prints are in too! What about that?
Yeah, not my fave but that's probably my best option for the festival.
Flesh tones are in too.
Yeah that's cool as long as it's close to baby pink!
I think I'm gonna wear a full length lace dress.
I think I'll wear a floral mini, but I have to see what's in stores.
Do you wanna go shopping this weekend?
I'm not sure if we like the same stores, but sure!
We'll check out department stores, we'll both have options that way.
Ok, sounds like a plan. And Marshalls!
Definitely!
Cool I'll look up some ideas online first!
