So I heard that the Fast & Furious series is going all the way up to ten?
Wait, ten what?
Ten films. They announced around the sixth one that they were going all the way to ten.
Oh, really? That's interesting.
Yeah, I'm just curious to see where they;ll take the story.
I'd like to think that they'll retire all of the characters.
As in the same way they did with Brian's character?
Yeah. Just write them into normal lives.
I can't help but think they're going to kill somebody off.
That's a bit morbid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you have a favorite fast and furious movie?
I like the first one.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Why is that?
It reminds me of being in high school.
Oh is that how old you were when those came out?
Yeah dating myself a bit, but I was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite character in the Fast & Furious?
Dom is my favorite. How about you?
Brian is my favorite. He has such pretty blue eyes.
Dom is strong and muscular, the type of bad boy I like in a man.
Are you sad that the actor of Brian died in a tragic accident?
Yes, it was very tragic. At least it wasn't my precious Dom.
Did you like how they computer generated the scene with Brian in it?
It was awesome and looked so real. It had me in tears.
Same. He was like my husband. At least they ended the series well.
They actually have a new one that just came out. It's called the Fate of the Furious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So the 8 is then what?
It's currently out in the theaters. We should go watch it
What's it about, though
I guess the same stuff. Except Dom gets seduced by this girl. Or something.
But he's married?
Yep. And he goes off and gets Hobbs arrested while stealing some EMP thing for the girl, so they can go steal the God's eye
God's eye again. That's kinda getting old.
Well, that's the premise anyway. Anyway this Cipher girl blackmails Dom to doing more jobs for her.
And the English guy joins the team? Deckard guy from Furious 7?
Looks that way, Maybe he wanted in the action. i don't know. Anyway, we should go see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you get into watching the Fast and Furious movies?
I am really into cars so of course I love those movies!
That's great!  Do you have a favorite one?
Furious 7 is my all time favorite!  The whole sequence of them dropping the cars out of the back of an airplane was totally awesome!  The ending tribute to Paul Walker was also very nice!
I totally agree!  I was worried that the movies would not be as good without him but the latest one was still very good!
I know!  They really know how to step those movies up!  The twist with Alana being captured and then later killed really was a shock to me!
I know!  It was really cool to see Dominic being bad but at the same time it was sad!
Yes!!  I thought Charlize Theron did a very good job playing a villian!
For sure!  The fact that she's hot is a plus!  I love that they also brought both Shaw brothers into the mix!
I agree!  That made the movie that more exciting!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to catch the new Fast & Furious movie?
Nah. They stopped being good when they stopped being about street racing and turned into cheesy spy flicks
Same. And when Paul Walker died, it kinda made the whole street racing thing seem like a bad idea.
Yeah, it sucks when you get killed trying to do the same dumb stunts in reality as in your movies.
I mean, at least they still got Vin Diesel, but he's gettin' kinda old, ya know?
Same for Jason Statham. they need new movies, not more of the same old stuff.
Did you know Diesel play the voice of a robot?
Wait, seriously?
Yeah, he was the robot in "The Iron Giant."
I can see it now: "*BEEP BEEP* I AM GOING TO DO SOME DRIFTING AND MAKE JASON STATHAM LOOK GOOD."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Fast and the Furious chronology was different from it's story chronology?
What do you mean by that?
Like the movies do not all go in order.
I had no idea about that.
Yea, there were 2 short films that were released, one bridges the gap between the first and the second and one the second and the fourth.
That is interesting, I had no idea.
Tokyo Drift was the third released but actually takes place after the sixth movie.
That is just strange, why would they do that.
They probably did not plan on the franchise lasting this long when they made the third.
They were definitely wrong about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Fast and Furious movies?
I don't think I have but I know about them from watching their trailers on tv.
Yeah, me too.  They look okay, kind of interesting.
Didn't one of the main actors die a year or so ago?
I think he did.  I think it's a little wierd that they keep making the movies and using his image in them.
I totally agree with that. It's a little creepy.
On the flip side, the car chase and race seens look pretty cool.
They really do. I do like Vin Diesel too.
Me too.  I'd like to see one or more of the movies just because he's in them.
The newest one is called The fate of the Furious and it's got some big name actors in it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Brian aka Paul Walker from the Fast & Furious movies.
Yes, I heard he died awhile back.
Yes he did, do you remember the tribute they did for him at the end of the seventh movie?
Yes, do you know who did that song?
I believe it was Whiz Khalifa.
That's actually one of my favorite songs now.
It's such a good song and im happy that they did a tribute for Brian who was such a vital part of peoples lifes after all these movies.
Yep and i'm glad they did a good job capturing what it means to be part of someone's life.
The feels were so strong during that moment in the movie.
Yep, the song brings back those feels everytime I heard it now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the beginning of the original Fast and the Furious movie?
Yes. The car chase was intense.
I wondered who those people were with the cars.
It was a heart pounding scene.
They filmed that chase really good.
Yes. That film was directed well.
What was the most suspenseful part of the scene to you?
When they were about to go into that construction zone.
I remember that.
That was a really cool intro.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The fast & Furious Franchise lost a great friend when Paul Walker died.
Man don't even say that to me, I always cry.
I remember the first day we met Brian Spilner, sitting in the dinner asking for a tuna fish sandwich.
Spilner/ Don't you mean O'conor.
No, I mean Spilner; that was his undercover alias when he was after Dom in the first film.
How exactly do you remember that?
How do you not, when Dom took his ID and said "Brian Spilner? That sounds like a serial killer's name."
Oh yeah, ok, now I remember. Dude how many times did you watch that movie?
30, why is that a lot?
Yes, that is way too many, but do you wanna make it 31 because now I want to watch it again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
What was the last fast and furious movie you saw?
I just saw the latest one in theaters.
Oh really?
Yeah.
How was it?
It wasn't the best of the series, but it was good action.
Oh that's good.  I heard it got so so reviews.
Yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was Roman Pierce's best line in 2 fast 2 furious?
I'm actually torn on that one. If I had to choose then when they were walking away at the end of the movie.
After they took some of the ransom cash.
Yeah, after Brian said "Our pockets ain't empty cuz", then Roman lifts up his shirt and says "and we ain't hungry no more either", and he's got cash stuffed in his pants.
That was a great walkout line, what was your number two.
Well it's not so much what he said but what he did when he said it. It was when they were driving to the final meet.
Let me guess, it was just when he hit the ejector button.
Yes! That was hilarious, he just hit the button and shouts to the guy "ejecto seato cuz!", I was on the floor laughing after that.
Well it is hard narrowing down a Roman Pierce quote.
Well of course it is, he never stops talking or he'd die.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Fast and Furious character?
I like The Rock, he's great.
Oh you mean his character Luke Dobbs. Yeah he's funny.
He was so funny in Furious 7.
Yeah when he jumped a ambulance of a bridge onto a plan? That was insane.
I liked when he flexed so hard it ripped of the cast on his arm.
That or when he picked up the gun and said, "I am the cavalry."
Yeah, he's great. Did you see him in Fast 8?
Yeah he was good in that too.
Yes, he's a good addition to the series indeed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Fast Five?
No, I haven't. Is it in the Fast and Furious series?
Yeah, it is. It came out two years after the first one with Paul Walker.
Oh, what is this one about?
Paul Walker and Vin Diesel's characters have to team up again to escape from the authorities.
That sounds similar to the first one.
It is similar, but this time they're the bad guys instead of the good guys.
Oh, okay. Who else is in the movie?
Dwayne Johnson plays a federal agent.
That's cool, I really like him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Fast & the Furious?
Yes I did but it's not the same without Mia and Brian.
I know Paul Walker wasn't in this one because he passed, but why wasn't Mia?
I don't know. I think each movie gets more unrealstic.
You're totally right the action scenes Dom and his team do aren't believable.
Is that the last Fast & Furious movie to come out?
I am pretty sure it is. I have seen them all except for Too Fast & Furious.
I have seen them all. My favorite is Tokyo Drift.
Yeah I like that one because Bow Wow is in it.
I just like those cars the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Fast and Furious movie was it that they found out Lettie is alive?
That was Fast Five (Fast and Furious Five).
How did they explain her death?
She was in that car accident in #4 and then she crawled out.  She had amnesia.
Did they explain how Dom had a relationship with that Brazil cop?
They did show them together at the beginning, but it sort of dropped off after that.
I heard in Fast 8 that the Brazil cop and Dom had a baby, is that true?
Yes they explained they had an affair while Lettie was "dead".
What did they name the baby?
Brian -- after the character in the movie, but I think they should have named him Paul.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Have you seen the latest Fast and Furious?
8?
Yeah the one in theaters now.
No, I haven't.  Have you?
I haven't either.
Do you plan on seeing it.
I'm not sure at the moment.
I don't plan on going to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know part of the fast and furious movies i love the most?
Which one
The ones with the safes and they somehow switch them and nobody sees
That was pretty awesome
It was so smart and well thought out
Yea i didnt know what they were doing
It was so shocking
It was great
That whole movie was awesome
It was
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that the 'Fast & Furious' movies objectify women?
Now that's an interesting question.  I would definitely say yes, but I have mixed feelings.
Can you elaborate?
On one hand, this franchise has so much gratuitous and random shots of scantily clad females.
That's almost a cornerstone at this point.
But on the other hand, women should do whatever they feel is empowering to them.  Also, the coolest characters are female in the series.
Letty is definitely the coolest and toughest of that whole crew next to Dom.
Those two characters are perfect for each other.
Gisele, portrayed by Gal Gadot, I thought was also pretty empowering as a character.
Don't forget the woman who played the police officer from Brazil.  She was a strong female character too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Fast and Furious movies?
Yeah I do, but I liked them more when they were more about cars.
Yeah, they stopped that around the fifth one it seems like.
Yeah, once the Rock got involved in the franchise it became more about action than racing.
It is not as good without Paul Walker.
I know right, it is just not the same with Bryan in them.
I think when Paul Walker passed away, they should of just ended the series there.
Yeah, they had a really good send-off for him in the seventh movie.
That song they played at the end almost made me cry.
It was the saddest part of any Fast and Furious movie, I can tell you that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Fast and Furious movie?
Probably The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.
What do you like about that one?
It's pretty exotic.  All the neon in downtown Tokyo at night.
Right. Anything else?
The drifting technique.  Kind of fascinating.
They made it look effortless.
But I think it really takes a lot of practice.
And the ensemble was really great in this one.
Plus so much racing on the surface streets. Spectacular!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite scene out of all the Fast & the Furious movies?
Can't believe you're asking this question, but everyone's favorite scene should be Brian and Dom's first race...
That honestly feels like sooo long ago! Refresh my memory, I haven't watched the orginial movie in years.
Brian's an undercover cop and tries to infiltrate Dom's shop to catch a group of street racer theives. Dom doesn't take kindly to Brian snooping around but Brian challenges Dom to a street race, something Dom cannot turn down.
I remember now! That scene really was epic. It laid the groundwork for all the movies that followed. Crazy.
Dom and Brian aren't close friends yet but the core dynamic of their relationship is established with that one race. Really set the pace for everything.
What did Brian tell Dom at the end of that first race?
Brian shouted, "Dude, I almost had you!" with Dom responding in typical Dom fashion saying, "You almost had me? You never had me. You never had your car! Granny shifting, not double clutching like you should...you’re lucky that hundred shot of NOS didn’t blow the welds on the intake...you almost had me?"
Even with Dom humiliating Brian after that first race he still seems fond of Brian’s competitive energy.
Brian and Dom were like a match made in heaven. All together a great duo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you by any chance have a favorite character in the Fast & Furious movies?
Honestly, I really don't.
Seriously? I thought that everyone has a favorite character in that series.
Truth be told, I really don't have a favorite anything in that series.
But you told me that you watch those movies pretty much all the time.
That's true, but I don't know why.
That doesn't make sense.
Enough about me! Do you have a favorite character in it?
Yeah. Mine's Dominic.
It's because of Vin Diesel, isn't it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Fast and Furious movies?
Yes, I've seen all of them except the 8th one.
The one that's out in theaters now?
Right, I haven't seen that one yet.
Which one -- of the ones you've seen -- is your favorite?
I probably enjoyed the 1st one the most, but I liked them all. Some were better than others, though.
Which one did you like the least?
I think the second one is probably my least favorite.
Yeah, I agree. I can't even really remember the second one very much.
It's the one where Brian teams up with Roman Pearce as undercover cops. Vin Deisel and Michelle Rodriquez aren't in it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Fast and Furious movies?
I've only seen the 6th one, and the end of the 7th one.  Do you like them?
I think they're pretty fun.  Dumb but fun.
I liked what I saw.  It's always fun to watch Dwayne Johnson throw people around.
Oh yeah, the scene in the interrogation room?
Yeah - jeez, that was a lot of damage!  The light fixtures too?
Well, that's what you get when you mess with Dwayne.
I can tell!  How about that scene with the plane?
That was great!
How did the plane stay at such a low altitude without crashing?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Fast and Furious movies?
I think I have. I liked them.
Do they seem ok for kids?
No probably not.
Ok. My son likes cars and was asking about these movies.
How did he hear about them?
His friend showed him some of one of the movies.
Oh and now he wants to watch the rest?
Yeah exactly.
Well you could pre-screen the first movie and see what you think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Fast & Furious actor?
Paul Walker. I love his character of Brian O'Connor. From good guy, to bad guy...back to good again.
Then back to bad. I adore Ludarcis' character. He's so funny!
He and Tyrese Gibbs are awesome. The way their two characters are always fighting, yet they are there for each other always.
I have to admit that Jason Statham's addition to the franchise made things easy on the eyes.
I loved the way he and Hobbs met. Even though he is a bad guy, I love Deckard Shaw.
That accent! The way he fights, the way he always is one step ahead of Dom and his team.
Even when he is put in maximum security, he is still one step ahead of Hobbs.
I was so sure that Elana and Hobbs were going to end up together, instead of her and Dom.
I was too. But, she and Dom made a striking couple for a little while.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know what NOS was when you watched The Fast and the Furious?
I had no clue and I still don't.
It was cool how it made him go way faster.
Paul Walker?
Everyone actually. They all used it.
That movie taught me a lot about cars.
Me too.
I loved the scene where Paul Walker put his car on the line.
Yeah, I was rooting for him.
It sucks that he lost though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite scene in all of the Fast & Furious movies?
I would say, it was when they went under the 18 wheeler. That started it all. You?
The bridge jump was the best! It got my adrenaline going.
Which car do you think was better, the Skyline or the 1970 Dodge Charger?
Obviously, I would choose the Skyline. But that Dodge Charger is a classic.
I think the Dodge Charger beats them all. It's a lot of American muscle.
I feel like Japanese cars are better built, and last much longer.
If you take care of the Dodge Charger, it can last just as long.
What's the best stunt in the movie?
I would say the Abu Dhabi Car Jump was awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Fast 8?
I thought it was okay, a little over the top if you ask me. I thought Fast 8 was better.
Why do you say that?
Well, the part where all the cars were dropping from the above parking garage and the auto driving cars causing havoc in the city, that was a little too cheesy.
Yea, I guess I agree a bit but that's how these movies usually are.  The storyline wasn't as good either.
Also, the part where they had 5 cars latched onto Dom's car trying to take it apart yet it remained steady.  A bit unbelievable.
I like how they worked Jason Statham into the story and he eventually became a good guy.
Yea probably.  I think they're going to have a story where Jason Statham is part of the team in Fast 9
You think there will be a Fast 9?
Yes, the movie franchise is on a roll right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the first Fast & Furious movie.
Did you like it?
Yeah it was really awesome.
Wasn't Vin Diesel in that one?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's in all of them.
Is Dwayne Johnson in that one? The only one I saw had him in it.
He's not in the first one. He joined later in the series.
Have you seen any of the others?
I've seen them all.
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know how to drift a car?
Are you asking for a friend?
Well, I mean, I saw this new fast and the furious movie and now I want to try it.
You are going to wreck yourself.
But vin diesel makes it look so easy!
Movies aren't reality man, let it go.
How hard can it be?
Is this really the person you want to be, copying movies?
Cars are cool.
You need help.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to know what I don't understand about Fast and the Furious?
What's that?
Why is it that after eight movies, and showcasing classic, American and import cars, I've never seen a Jeep Wrangler featured.
You probably haven't seen one because because Jeeps are notoriously slow. The movie is called Fast and The Furious not Slow and the Curious.
You're probably right. However, I can definitely Hobbs or Shaw sporting one!
Yeah! Especially in the latest movie, Fast and Furious 8!
What happened in that one?
Well, as the team was trying to stop the hacker in Russia from stealing a submarine with bombs, they were caught by the Russian military. There was snow everywhere.
Oh really? That would've been perfect for a Jeep!
Well maybe they will in the next one, Fast and the Furious 9!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that Dom's car is better than Brians in The original Fast& Furious?
Are you talking about in the end when they are racing
Yes Dom has a classic car and Brian has a Japanese car
I think on a straightaway Dom's car wins hands down
Why do you think that?
American Muscle had a ton of horsepower, Brians car would win with a lot of curves but that's the only way
Brian's car had NOS though which should have accounted for extra speed
Plus don't forget Dom has been racing his entire life so he could have gotten every bit of speed out of his car
Yeah I see your point
Best case scenario they tied
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was so happy when Ludacris showed back up in the Fast5.
Tej is definitely welcome at my house anytime.
Well when he's gonna show up with nice cars, hot women, and gets you paid; why wouldn't he be?
I like him a lot better after he lost the afro and sweats though.
Agreed, it certainly upped his cool factor.
My favorite scene was in the 7th movie I think, when he was talking to Rome and Rome was telling him how rare his car was.
Then Tej walked outside and he had the same exact one.
Yes, I busted out laughing at that.
That was classic, but for me, his best scene was his first appearance. After the race when Brian gives him some of the winnings and he turns to show it off to the crowd.
And thus the legend was born.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can we talk about the trucker from the original The Fast and The Furious?
What about that trucker?
Well, he's the only guy who's been able to battle off Dom. If you think about everything Dom's been able to accomplish throughout the whole series, the Trucker was the only one to have successfully foil his plans.
That's funny. I never thought about that but you're right. That trucker was prepared, with his shotgun, and he was so calm during the whole truck heist.
Seriously, that trucker is legendary. He must be sitting at home watching the events from all the other Fast and Furious movies and laughing to himself about how he stood up to Dom.
It's amazing really, he was on his own in that truck and I think he took out Vince, and nearly got Dom too.
Dom never really talks about this incident.
You can safely say that Dom probably erased it from his mind like it never happened.
The trucker needs to make a return in the next Fast and Furious as the ultimate nemesis.
I would die from laughter if that happened. I can see him teaming up with Charlize's character, Cyper, to exact revenge on Dom's team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you into cars before watching Fast and the Furious or after?
I saw the first one was I was little, so definitely after.
What about the movies made you get into cars?
The cars were so cool, and Paul Walker was cool.
Did you like any specific cars from the movies?
I was always a fan of the cars that Paul Walker drove.
He always had foreign cars and modified cars like Mitsubishis and such.
Yeah and they were more colorful as opposed to Vin Diesel's cars.
So did you Tokyo Drift then?
Yes, that one is my favorite. I have been a big drifting fan since and love the cars in that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift was a horrid movie.
Really? I thought the movie was pretty good. Why didn't you like it?
The acting was pathetic and it just really didn't fit in with the other two. I mean come on Paul and Vin were nowhere in it and their interation made the ones before.
Well, I guess you have a point, but I thought the change of scenery was pretty cool and the cultural shift intrigued me.
The change in scenery doesn't excuse that kids horrible accent and just all around bad acting skills.
Well, which one did you like the most?
I really think the original Fast and Furious was the best out of all of them. You got the whole feeling of Paul Walker and his loyalty first to the police and then to Vin
Oh ya! Isn't that when the term Busta came into play? During that movie?
Yes! It Did! When they were at the party Dom was like Busta id the only one that kept me outta cuffs! That was great!
I really should watch the first one again it's been so long!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the last Fast and Furious movie?
The Fate of the Furious, yeah like 4 times already.
I just watched it for the first time last night.
Ok, first question, how did you "just" see that movie?
I know I'm super late, but I couldn't get a chance to see it in the theaters.
Well anyway what did you think of the first part in Cuba?
Where Dom freaking drove a car backward to win?
No, I mean where he drove a car backward, that had been ripped down to the studs, and was on fire?
It is by far the best way to open that movie.
Are you kidding me, every action movie should open with that scene; not just racing ones, I mean action movies in general
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw The Fast and the Furious movie.  The first one.
Cool.  Who directed that?
Rob Cohen.
Who plays the hot girlfriend?
Michelle Rodriguez
She was great in Girlfight.
She was in Avatar, too.
Who is the cop's girlfriend?
Jordana Brewster as Mia.
Wow, she's hot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Fast and Furious Movie?
I really like Furious 7. What do you think?
Yeah I really like that one too.
It was so amazing when they made the car fly! I almost believed they did for a second.
Yeah, I was surprised too. It was even funnier to see Paul Walker's character's expression.
I know, he looked so scared!
The only thing that I think needed more work was the dialogue. It just seemed kind of cheesy.
The dialogue is usually a little cliche, but I only watch for the action.
Oh yeah, the action is really good.
I'm excited to see what they do for the next one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen any of the Fast & Furious movies?
Yeah, they are awesome action films. I love Vin Diesel.
And I really admire how they do their car stunts live, they don't just lay back and do the whole thing with CGI.
It takes a lot of effort to do movies the old fashioned way, with special effects and stunts on the set. Props to them for that.
Yes, I saw an interview with the cast, and they were really proud of what they achieved on set.
I didn't know how they were going to handle Paul Walker's death, may he rest in peace.
Yeah, as I watched that last film he was in, I kept waiting for the character to get killed off.
I absolutely loved that they fashioned a happy ending for him, and he didn't die, he just kind of rode off into the sunset with his family.
I agree, that was the best possible ending for that character, and a terrific sendoff for Paul Walker.
I didn't expect it, and it is one of my favorite endings of any film. It gave me chills.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why did Han go to Tokyo?
He went after Gisele died, to clear his head and do street racing.
It didn't say that in the movie.
I know, they aren't in order.
Why did Dom go to Tokyo then?
He went to recover Han's body, after he was killed in the accident.
Who was Sean, and why was he so important in this movie?
Han took an interest in Sean, and saw it as a way to beat the Yakuza at their own game.
Who killed Han?
Han was killed by Owen Shaw, Decker Shaw's "big bad brother".
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Fast & Furious movies have had some great soundtracks over the years.
They have! Do you have a favorite?
That'd probably be Fast & Furious 6.
That film's main theme was so great.
Yes! Whoever calls for these soundtracks really know how to appeal to big audiences..
My entire family was hooked onto that song after we went to see the film.
Fate of the Furious also has a fantastic soundtrack.
That one's a classic for rap fans, mainly.
Exactly why I like it. I'm a rap fan!
So am I!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the fast and furious movies?
All but the last one
I havent seen it either.
Ive been wondering what its like
Me too, its probably not the same without paul walker.
I know i cant believe hes gone
Me either
He was so good in those movies
And really cute too
Yes and really cute
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Fast and Furious Six last night.
Who directed it?
Justin Lin, again.
Same old crew?
Yes, Vinny Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson.
What happens in the movie?
Johnson persuades Diesel and Walker to go after a bad guy in exchange for amnesty.
Same old.  I hear Letty turns up.
Yes, they get back together.
Very convenient.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the last Fast and Furious movie?
Is that the seventh one?
No, it is the eigth one, Fate of the Furious
Then no, I am behind a movie.
It is good, the Rock is great in it.
He is the best part now, Dom in overrated.
Agreed, I cannot wait for his movie with Jason.
Yes, that is a spinoff I will see.
Which one is your favorite moive?
I like Fast Five, I still miss Giselle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Fast and Furious original.
Its the best one.
They were so young looking.
It was so cool to see it for the first time.
The ending was awesome.
That old muscle car was powerful.
It did a wheelie off the line.
I liked that he didnt get caught.
The cop let him go.
He risked his job for his friend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Do you like fast and the furious?
I like some of the films.
There are quite a few.
How many are they up to now?
I believe this is the 8th one.
wow that is a lot.
Do you think it will be good?
I have no idea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to see the fate pf the furious so bad
I kind of want to see it
Ive been waiting for it to come out
I wonder what it will be like eithout paul walker
Im thinking its going to be sad
Thats what i was thinking
But i still want to see it
I will probably watch it out of curiousity
You will probably like it
Maybe
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the newest Fast & Furious movie?
No. I thought that the trailer made it look really silly.
What makes you say that?
I just find it silly that it evolved from street racing to basically vehicular warfare.
Okay, well that does sound pretty silly.
My point exactly. That's why I didn't watch the new one.
Oh. Well, I watched it, and I definitely thought it was alright.
Was there anything too remarkable about it?
It had great looking action scenes.
That's about what I expected.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The Fate of the Furious?
No, not yet. I'm dying to. I love those movies.
I heard that it's one of the most expensive movies ever made.
I can't imagine the price tag. But it's killing at the box office, I'm sure.
Remember the first one that came out?
Of course! I can't believe that came out, like, 16 years ago.
Vin Diesel was astonishing in that one.
I was hooked from the very beginning. Totally. Blew me away.
Now I have the watch the first one again. Maybe tonight!
Sounds like a plan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the Fast & Furious series?
I love those movies. Honestly, it's my favorite film franchise ever.
So you actually like the entire series, movie by movie?
Yes. Well, there's one thing that kind of bothers me.
What's that?
Probably the naming. Over the years, they've had some pretty odd names.
The fourth one was literally just Fast & Furious, wasn't it?
Yeah, that one has my least favorite title.
It's my least favorite everything.
I can understand that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I used to hate the Fast and the Furious movies but now I love them.
Really why?
I just didn't understand what was happening.
Makes sense. I think they're so cool!
Yeah I went back and rewatched them all. Now I'm obsessed.
Me too. I love Fast 5
Fast 5 is my favorite ! The characters are great and it's so action packed.
I agree. Plus the team makes the movie. With that switch at the end.
I know I was so mind blown.
It was genius that they got all that money.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the latest Fast and the Furious movie?
Which one is that? Fast 10?
No it's The Fate of the Furious!
So, Fast 8? Which one is the one that Paul Walker was in?
That was Furious 7, this one's the 8th one or something like that since they're numbered weird.
How did they handle the lack of Paul Walker?
They just mentioned Brian and Mia but that they're retired and not apart of the team anymore.
Oh that's nice, and I guess a respectful way to deal with him being gone instead of dying like other characters.
Yeah! Its a different tone I think, but not that bad.
Okay, I'll watch it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Fast & Furious character do you like out of all the movies?
Well my favorite Character of all the Fast and Furious Characters is Paul Walker. Broke my heart when he passed.
Yeah mine too such a tragedy to loose a fellow cast member in real life.
Despite the tragedy , the Fast and Furious movies are really good. I mean they gross 207.3 million USD on their very first of the trilogy .
Rob Cohen really knew what he was doing with the story line to capture an audience.
I heard they got a 53% on rotten tomatoes critics, for Fast and the Furious.
Really honestly after Fate and the Furious will there be anymore Furious movies?
Don't get your ducks in a row, but their just might be a Fast and the Furious 9.
You really think so I will be excited but now too excited like now they are dragging it!
Dragging it or not I am confident they will make sales Rob Cohen is a good director. he will capture the audience.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite actor by any chance?
Yes, and mine just happens to be Vin Diesel.
Let me guess, is it because of the Fast & Furious films.
You guessed correctly. Those really sold me on his acting ability.
I think those movies are so overrated.
I can understand that. They're incredibly popular.
Yeah, and because of that, so many people see them as film masterpieces.
That does get annoying rather quickly.
Keep in mind, though. I never said I didn't like them.
Oh, I understand.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved the backstory with Dom in the Fast and the Furious
Yeah, that thing with his dad was scary.
Did you like the date scene?
Yeah, that explained the group and how they formed.
I was really into that romance story with Paul Walker and Dom's sister.
Yeah, it was very cool.
I liked how he ordered the tuna everyday at her shop
Yeah. That was funny
I knew they were gonna get together
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite movie about cars?
Eh their is not to many of them
I like fast and furious
I only like one of them
Which one do you like
The one that is a spinoff i think
What one is that man
I like tokyo drift
That one was pretty lit i mus say
The rest do not do it for me
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the most outrageous stunt featuring a car in the Fast & the Furious movies?
I would have to say when Paul Walker and Vin Diseal drove the supercar between the Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi.
I was almost postivie you were going to say the bank vault scene!
What Fast movie was that in? I get them all mixed up now since there are so many.
The bank vault chase was in Fast 5, released in 2011.
Didn't Brian and Dom drag that entire bank vault down the streets of Rio de Janeiro?
Yes that's the scene! I think the craziest car scene was in 2 Fast 2 Furious, the first race when Brain jumped over the draw bridge in his car.
That scene still gives me chills when I watch it. The cinematography makes the viewer feel the adrenaline that the racers are feeling all the way up until the end.
I think you can say that about any of the Fast & the Furious movies. Each film is adrenaline packed to the core.
Oh but what about that tank car chase in Fast & Furious 6? That was the most adrenaline packed scene in the entire series in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Am I the only one that gets sort of angry at the Fast & Furious characters?
In what sense?
In that those guys are all villains.  They are actual bad guys.
Now that you mention it, they are all thieves and crooks.
More than that even, it's their total disregard for everyone outside of their "family."
That is so true.  In 'Fast Five,' they basically destroyed parts of Brazil while dragging that bank vault with their cars.
And don't forget 'The Fate of the Furious' when they go to Germany and kill a bunch of police officers who try to stop them from stealing.
That was even worse.  They always cheer and have a good time about it too.
I think that's why for me, I just can't sympathize with any of them.
It's very hard to root for characters with such few morals!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new movie Fast & Furious 8?
No, I saw  the trailer it looks like it is going to be another great movie.
I have seen Fast & Furious 2.
The movies are filled with lots of action and drag racing.
They also have great cars.
Do you have a favorite out of all eight movies?
Fast & Furious 2, road of rage was pretty good.
Do you like all those cool cars in the movies, like the Honda Civic Coup.and the Ford?
Yes, there is also was a scene in the movie were someone is driving a cool Mitsubishi Gto car.
The Fast & Furious movies are fun to watch, and the viewers will be sitting on the edge of their seats through the whole picture.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the scene from the first Fast & Furious in the Tran's garage?
I'm not sure if I do.
When Brian was looking for the stolen stuff from the truck robberies?
Oh right, when he almost got found out by Dom.
Yeah, the scene with the mechanic is what I mean specifically.
Oh when he's watching the guy get tortured.
Yeah that's it, it took me so long to figure out what he Tran was talking about when he asked 40 weight or 50 weight.
Are you for real right now?
Yes I know now, but I completely spaced about oil viscosities when I was watching it the first few times.
I think I'm gonna find a new mechanic, no offense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, you're a car fan.
You could say that.
You have seen the fast and furious movies right?
Um, duh.
They are so good!
You dont have to tell me twice!
I didnt think they could get better after the second one, but when the rock showed up everything changed.
Yeah I think the rock single handedly saved the franchise.
Man, we have to marathon those movies soon.
Lets get to it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite actor in "2 Fast 2 Furious"?
Well, I like Ludacris who plays Tej because of his smooth acting skills.
Ludacris is cool but I am more interesting in the skills of Tyrese Gibson who plays Roman Pierce.
Tyrese is very smooth in his acting skills and he has been acting for a while now.
I also like the story line the movie. Do you remember what happened to Carter the drug dealer?
Yes, doesn't he get arrested at the end while trying to get away from the cops?
Yes, that is right. He was a very smooth actor as well. What is his real name?
I believe his real name is Cole Hauser. I have seen him like a couple of movies since he played in this one.
Can you imagine having a house like he did in the movie? Such a big house and all the cars he had.
Tell me about it. I will one day be living like him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite Fast & Furious movie?
My favorite The Fate of the Furious
Is that the one where Charlize Theron was the villian Cipher?
Yes! She played that part perfectly.
I agree she did. It was horrible when she killed Elena.
I know! I am so glad Dom and the team were able to beat her.
Me too. Dom's son was so cute at the end.
He was adorable. I think it's so good Letty was accepting of his son.
She really supports him. She was the main one saying that he hadn't gone rouge.
Yeah she really loves him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the first Fast and Furious movie?
I've seen all of them, but that one is my favorite.
I sue it in my class to teach irony.
How do you do that?
It's dramatic irony because we know something that the characters don't.
Like that Paul Walker is a cop?
Exactly.  Plus it's also situational irony.
When does that happen?
At the end when Paul Walker throws Vin Diesel the keys.  Not exactly what your expecting.
Good point.  Those are probably good examples for kids.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the 3rd Fast & Furious movie?
I had mixed feelings about that one, I mean none of the original characters and some random guy as lead.
Yeah I get what you mean, but it was still pretty cool.
Yeah especially when Han was showing off why he drifts and the girl passes him her phone number.
I was thinking the same thing. What did you think about Twink's ride.
The green Hulk mobile?
Yeah, I though it was pretty sweet.
You also think tires are free don't you?
Well obviously someone liked it or it wouldn't be in the movie.
Obviously they only liked it enough to have it in like 2 scenes for comic relief.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about role of mia in fast and furious series?
What do you mean?
I mean is she necessary character?
I think she does have some role in whole story.
But what I am asking can the series survive without her?
I think the series can survive without her, but still she does play some role.
Anyways, there are lots of other characters which can be removed.
I do not agree, I mean many of those characters make the whole series more interesting.
I can agree to ron's character on that.
Oh yes, he makes the whole series amusing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the most underrated Fast & Furious movie, in your opinion?
I think it's 2 Fast 2 Furious.
Hmm, interesting choice. Any reason why?
People tend to overlook it because it doesn't feature Vin Diesel.
Oh yeah, it starred Tyrese as the sidekick right.
Yeah, Tyrese was able to inject more humor into the movie.
It makes sense that they brought him back for future movies.
Exactly. The chemistry between Paul Walker and Tyrese was undeniable.
I guess people dislike the movie because of its ridiculous plot, but that ridiculousness would be the hallmark of the franchise.
Yeah, it was the precursor to the later movies, where insane plot lines are the norm.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Fate of the Furious yet?
No I haven't, how many have there been now?
That is the eighth one, came out not too long ago.
I have not seen any since Tokyo Drift?
You stopped right when it starts to get good.
Really?  It felt like it was getting so bad.
I think the fifth and the sixth were the best.
The third was really bad.
Yea, they became more entertaining and more action movies after that.
Maybe I will go back and watch some.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The cars in the first movie are so old
What series
The fast and the furious
Well the movie is over ten years old
Are you kidding me
nope i am serious it is pretty old
Wow that is surprising
Why
Because it means it has lasted quite some time
I know but thats also impressive
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the Fast and the Furious series for the first time.
What did you think of it. I love those movies.
I really liked them. There was one I wasn't thrilled about though.
Which one was that?
I wasn't a big fan of Tokyo Drift.
Really?! That is one of my favorites.
I know, I hear that from a lot of people. I just feel it is kind of thrown in and doesn't really go with the rest of the series.
Ya I guess I can see that. I really like the main character though.
Ya he is ok. The best thing for me out of this movie was the introduction of Han.
Oh ya definitely. He is one of my favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the second Fast and the Furious short film?
You mean 2Fast2Furious?
No, there was a short called Los Bandoleros in 2009.
Which movie did it come out closest to?
I believe Fast & Furious.
No I have not seen or even heard of that.
It mainly featured Sung Kang and some Vin.
I will check that out sometime.
You should, it was not bad at all.
I will, thanks for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch all Fast and Furious movies?
No I only saw a few of them.
Did you see the first one?
Yes but it was a long time ago.
It is worth watching again.
I do remember it was good.
Yes the car scenes were very well done.
Yes I could pay more attention to that.
Yes the acting was excellent as well.
I do like the actors, thank you for the recomendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Could you imagine a more actiony fast and furious movie
What in the world are you on about
Making those movies more action focused
That makes no sense
How so
Imagine them like twisted metal or something
Like racing cars with guns
Yeah man
That is the dumbest thing ever it would kill what makes it good
Why is that
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what do you think of the new furious movie, the Fate of the Furious?
I watched it in the theaters the other day and it is by far one of my favorites!
Mine as well. My friends and I watched it just the other day. I can never get enough of Dom and Hobbs.
Oh! And I can't believe they brought Deckard back.
Lord, I could never imagine that he could be portrayed as a good guy.
He actually saved Dom's son. The interaction with him and the baby was hilarious.
The Fate of the Furious was not only great action, but great comedy as well.
All around balanced. I do hope they make more movies in the Furious Franchise, I love to see more of Dom, Letty and Hobbs and maybe more of Deckard as well.
i'm sure there will be more to come. They do have a new story to tell after all. Dom's son.
cheers!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Fast and the Furious part 2?
Not as much as part 1
Did you love part 1 way more?
Yes, the story was way more organic and an overall great film.
Did you like Paul Walker?
Yes, he had a lot of depth.
I bet that franchise has made a ton of money.
Yeah, they have made tons of movies
Do you like the ones with The Rock in them?
Yeah, they are pretty good, but they are no part 1.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the series?
It's alright, tons of action though.
And really hot guys haha.
Yea, definitely! I love dom!
Han too!
Oh you like tokyo drift?
Yea I do!
The timeline gets a bit weird in the series.
Yea, but it's not so bad.
I hope they only go forward after this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you said that you're a fan of Furious 7?
Yes, I am. I really liked that movie when I first watched it.
What did you like about it?
There was a lot of things. It'd be hard to tell you just one......
Well break it down for me!
I really liked the story, especially what they ended up doing with Brian's character.
Right. I was very nervous about what they'd do with him after Paul's passing.
Same here, but I think they handled it the best way they possibly could.
So many people cried during that closing scene, didn't they?
You bet. I counted at least ten people immediately next to me all in tears inside the theater.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think there will be another Fast and the Furious movie?
I just watched the current one and it really seems like there is opportunity for another one.
How did you like it?
It was pretty good. I didn't think it would be but it was full of great actors.
I really love Jason Statham. He was supposed to be a bad guy but I kind of cried when I thought he died.
That was horrible. I thought Dom had turned to the bad side and Jason Statham was becoming a good guy.
I thought it was so cute the way Jason Statham rescued Dom's baby.
That baby was adorable. He was right on cue with whatever was said.
Yeah, and then Letty was so accepting of the baby.
I can't wait to see what happens in the next movie if they make another one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which movie in the Fast and Furious Franchise is your favorite?
I would have to say the first one.
Have you seen them all?
I've seen all of them except the last one.
Which one didn't you like?
I couldn't bring myself to like Tokyo Drift.
What didn't you like about Tokyo Drift.
I felt like it was too disconnected from the other films.
How do you feel Tokyo Drift was disconnected from the other films?
Tokyo Drift didn't really have the other characters or the same plot lines as the rest of the movies in the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Have you seen any of the fast and furious movies?
Yeah.
Do you have a favorite?
I like 5.
Is that the one in Brazil?
No, it's the one where they take on a cartel in mexico
Oh I don't think I saw that one.
It's quite good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Fast and the Furious movies?
I thought they were ok.
Why just ok?
I just miss Paul Walker.  I really watched those movies because of him.
Yea it's pretty sad that he's gone.
It really is, he had great chemistry with Tyrese and Ludacris.
Yea, he will be missed.
Definitely, without him I get a bit sad when watching the new films.
At least he has a legacy.
Yea, those original movies were great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the first Fast and Furious short film?
What do you mean by short film?
There were two short films released outside of the movies.
I do not believe I have seen either, when did they come out?
One in 2003 one in 2009.
No I have not seen either.
The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious was the first.
That is a long name, at least I know what it is about.
Yea it pretty much bridges the first and second films.
I had no idea it even existed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Fast & Furious actor.
My favorite actor is Tyrese.
Tyrese is amazing in this series.
I agree, he was specially awesome in the 4th movie of this series.
I like how he brings comedy to this movie series.
Yes, comedy is important in these movies.
I agree because with all of the action, comedy is a great balance.
Tyrese has been one of my favorite actors since Baby Boy.
It's amazing how he can act and sing.
Yes, being a dual threat is amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why are the Fast and Furious movies shown out of order?
I think because after #3 - Tokyo Drift - they did not think the franchise would come back.
Why, because Vin Diesl was off staring in Triple X movies?
Yes and because for the second movie, Paul Walker couldn't really carry it alone.
Paul Walker wasn't in the Fast 8 movie was he?
No, he died during the filming of Fast and Furious 7 so they just did not include him or Jordanna Brewster, who plays Mia.
Is Fast 8 just as good as the rest?
I think so, it has a good storyline, but I honestly think they should have stopped after Fast and Furious 7.
Do you think they will go all the way to 10?
Hard to say, but I think all the stars would definitely do it becaus the Fast and Furious franchise still makes a lot of money worldwide.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is you favorite Fast and Furious movie?
I didn't see but one or two.
I can't remember the first one very well it was so long ago
Yes that was 2001 with Vin Diesel
Right that was one of the reasons I wanted to see it was he was someone new and interesting to see as a character.
That didn't last long. He got really boring to watch.
You are right about that. He didn't entice me to want to watch that next two Fast and Furious movies.
I saw them. Not so great.
When Tokyo Drift came out I wanted to go see it just for the drifting because it looked so cool. But I never went.
I didn't go because they were all the same to me
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to talk about movies
Sure that sounds fun
Great
Whats your favorite?
Definitely the fast and the furious
I love those movies too
They are really exciting and fun to watch
They are and the actors are great
Definitely
I love vin disel
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like that fast and the furious movies?
Not really.
Oh how come?
I just thought it was too predictable for a action movie.
Oh like what do you mean?
Like the explosions and the women crowding around races.
Does that not happen in real life?
Not that I know of.
Oh I had no idea.
Yea. I just didnt like them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the first time you saw The Fast and The Furious?
Yes, I was 14.
What did you think of it when you were 14?
I loved it.
What did you love about it?
I loved the characters, and the hot guys.
What about the cars?
I loved the cars too.
But not as much as Dominic?
Of course not!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite 'Fast & Furious' movie?
That's a tough question to answer.  I loved Five, but Seven was so emotional.
Yea, that last scene was such a touching goodbye to Paul Walker and his character.
I'd say it's a tie between those two.  How about you?
I actually really loved the first two.
You mean when it used to be about street racing?
Exactly.  That was always the main appeal for me.
They still have racing.
They do, but the racing is portrayed almost like an afterthought.
You have a point.  After Tokyo Drift, that street racing element started to get placed in the background.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So have you seen all the Fast & Furious movies?
I believe so, they're all so great
but which one is your favorite?
if you have to choose, it's gonna be the one that involves cars jumping over a drawbridge, I don't remember which one that was
sounds like the second one when Paul Walker was an under cover FBI agent
yea that's the one, god I miss Paul Walker already
yea me as a fan of the series as well, it's so sad to see Paul Walker gone, at such young age
you know there was a song dedicated to him, "see you again"?
oh yeah, How could I miss that song, I heard it has 28 million views on Youtube already?
yeah, it's crazy, but Paul deserved it
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Fast and Furious movie?
The original for sure.
I like the Furious 7.
They were all good.
Who was your favorite character?
Paul Walker for sure.
I like Vin Diesel.
I heard he is short and wears lifts in his shoes.
Too bad that Paul Walker died.
Yeah but he went out doing what he loved.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could do one thing from Fast & Furious, what would it be?
Anything at all from any movie?
Yes, anything, and it was completely legal.
hmm... I guess I'd have to go with Driving the car between buildings.
You'd really want to drive a car out of a building and into another building?
No, in and out of three buildings.
That is just insane.
That is the point. I think it would be awesome.
It probably would be, but it'd be the last awesome thing you do.
Not if I jumped out at the last minute like Dom did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the first Fast and the Furious movie?
Yes. It is such a good movie!
I think I saw it eight times.
I probably saw it 12 times!  I love Paul Walker
Me too!  But I think I like Vin Diesel better.
He is in great shape!
When I listen to the sound track, I automatically drive faster.
Now I want to go watch the movie.
I have the DVD!
Oh, let's go watch it now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the new Fast & the Furious movie?
Honestly man they need to stop making them.
Why do you say that?
Dude they've already run their course, now the movies are turning into nothing but cgi and b.s. scenes with fast cars!
You have a point. Which movie is your favorite though?
The orginial one! Paul Walker in that first race scene was epic.
You're talking about the one with Ludacris right? When Paul Walker jumps the bridge in his eclipse?
Yes, that was probably one of the best racing scenes in any of the Fast movies.
Oh man I don't know about that. Tokyo Drift had some pretty epic racing scenes too!
Ehh serisouly? That's my least favorite Fast & the Furious movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Luke Hobbs character?
Wait, who's that.
He's Dwayne Johnson's character in the Fast & Furious series.
Oh, right. I like him.
I do, too. I just felt like they threw him in there too suddenly.
That's true. He just kind of appeared for Fast Five.
Without any story to carry over, either.
Well, I'm not sure if you remember this or not.
What's that?
Tokyo Drift, chronologically, comes way after any of the others, so by that point, Hobbs was already introduced to the team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what car I really want?
Ford Mustang.
Yep. Fast back 1967.
They modded that up so it will have 500 HP for the movie.
That's a lot of horses.
Did you know every single one of the mustangs used in the film survived? They were eventually auctioned off.
Are they even street legal? Thought they were like props or something.
no these were real street legal cars, all modded up for the movie.
I wonder how they went for?
They were auctioned off on ebay. They got between 14K to 22K for them
XXXXXXXXXXX
How is your favorite fast and furious actor?
I would say Ludacris?
Why Ludacris, he has such as small role?
I beg to differ, I really like his role.
Why do you like Ludacris' role?
I like his role because he is the under dog in all of the movies.
True, that is a good point.
Who is your favorite actor in the series?
My favorite actor is the Rock.
Oh yea, I love the Rock in all of his movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the best set-piece of the whole Fast & Furious franchise?
They keep ramping up the action and topping themselves each movie.  I need a moment to think about this.
I think mine was the scene in Fast 7 when the crew drives their cars out of the plane and parachute down.
That was a pretty epic scene.  I read that a lot of the car sequences once they hit ground were practical effects, and not CGI.
They actually threw a car out of a real plane too!
No way.  Really?
Yes.  There is a behind the scenes video where it is explained and shown.
That gives me new appreciation for the series.
There were camera men jumping with the cars and everything.  I hope they continue to do this.
I don't think there is any slowing down of this franchise in the near future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the love theme in the first Fast and the Furious?
Yes. It added a lot of depth
I was heartbroken when they went their seperate ways.
Yes. But, they came back together in the end.
I liked the tension between Paul Walker and Vin Diesel.
That was definitely the main conflict in the film.
The acting was really good.
Yes. Each actor brought their all to the movie.
I think this is the best car movie ever.
I agree. It is awesome and one of the best car movies ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think they will keep having success on the Fast and Furious movies without Paul Walker?
I would say yes, they sitll have the Rock and Vin Diesel who are both headline actors
True but the whole series without Paul just doesn't seem right and its missing something dont you agree?
I do agree but look at Tokyo Drift, noboby was in that one except for Lil Bow Wow and it did pretty good at the box office
Yeah that one I don't even consider as part of the Fast series it should just be called Tokyo Drift and drop the Fast and Furious logo
Did you know that a new Fast is being released sometime this year?
No I didn't but I guess i'll give it a chance and see if it's any good
Should be like I said they still have The Rock who is a great action actor
Yes I really liked him in Faster and The Scorpion King
Aw Man those movies were awful what bad examples of his better work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Fast and Furious movies.
Why? It's mindless garbage.
I think it's fun and enjoy the action.
I think it's made for idiots. I don't get the appeal.
It's supposed to be ridiculous. It's over the top and the corny dialogue makes it even better.
The only reason I'd watch it is because Ludacris is in it.
Yeah, he's great in all of them. I think they're all worth watching besides Tokyo Drift.
Maybe one day if I catch one of the movies on TV...
I highly recommend 2 Fast 2 Furious. That's the funniest one by far.
I'll remember that, but don't get your hopes up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like the fast series?
what's the 'fast' series?
the fast and the furious movie series, do you know it?
yes, though i'm not concerned about tools
what do you mean tools?
well i was under the impression the movies were regarding vehicles, is this correct?
yes, it's always got a car race or car chase scene
a car is a vehicle, a vehicle is a tool
do you think the fast and the furious are tool movies?
uhh, like all subjects in life, what i think is of no relevance;  the facts are clear
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch The Fate of the Furious?
Yea I did. I was really hoping there would be more racing.
Yea me too, they had some cool cars though.
Yea but they didn't focus on the cars at all.
True, but I still really enjoyed the plot
Really? The plot was terrible! There were so many holes in it.
Yea but the movie is supposed to be silly and over the top. You're being too critical.
Maybe you're right. It did have some cool fight scenes.
Yea, I would have loved to see The Rock and Jason Stathum finish that prison fight though.
Yea, me too! They stopped it too early.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the second Fast and the Furious movie?
Which one is that?
It was called 2Fast2Furious.
Is that the drifting one?
No, that was Tokyo Drift, the third in the series.
I am not sure if I have seen the second one, what happens?
It is where the FBI hires Brian to help take down a drug lord.
That does not sound too familiar
It was not the best one, quite forgettable.
Good thing I did not watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you like Fast Furious?
I think it's a great movie series, if Harry Potter accompanied my childhood, I think Fast and Furious accompanied my teenagehood.
I kinda feel the same, well you kinda make us look old, haha
did I? that wasn't intentional, but which one was your favorite?
you remember the one where the crew dragged a safe across the street of Rio?
oh yeah, it was such a blast in that summer, I can still remember it vividly
It's crazy what they can do with cars, do you remember which car they used to drag the safe?
that I'm not sure, it seemed to be a bullet proof super tough military SUV
indeed, I don't see myself buying one in the near future
me neither
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the best Fast and Furious movie?
Definitely the first one!
I would agree!
It was so original back then, all the actors were great too!
I like the story line because it actually made me care!
Seeing a young Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is so unreal too.
I liked when they try to beat the train at the end
It had me on the edge of my seat!
It was so sad when they both made it but then Vin crashed!
But it still had a happy ending so I'm happy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the first race in fast & furious?
The first ever race?
Yes that is the one i'm talking about.
Why do you ask?
I was just thinking about that scene and was curious if you remember if Brian's car was or broke down.
I believe it had some engine troubles during the race.
I remember he was trying to give Dom the best race he could.
Yep Brian tried so hard that one race.
That race set the stage for the rest of the movie and movies.
I agree I think if that scene sucked it wouldn't have been as big as it was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo you seen the new fast and furious movie?
Which one is that
Crap I'm not sure
Dude me neither
Is that the one where what's his name died after
I think so
No I don't think it is
You sure?
Yeah I'm sure, there's a new one out
Ok naw I haven't seen it then
XXXXXXXXXXX
i wonder if they will ever make a movie in the series with a different theme
What you mean bro
A fast and furious movie not about cars
Like something deeper
Yeah that exactly
It would be pretty neat would it not
I would sign up for that
It is pretty impressive idea to expand the franchise
It is always good for new things
Yeah same ol gets boring
XXXXXXXXXXX
You've seen 2 Fast 2 Furious right?
Yes I have it was one of my favorites.
Do you remember the scene with the yacht?
I don't recall that one.
Oh man, that was an awesome scene especially where the Yacht is escaping and Brian jumped the car onto the Yacht.
That's right, that scene was absolutely epic.
Wasn't Roman with him in the car?
I believe so.
I just remember someone screaming and that must have been Roman.
Yes it was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Fast and The Furious is still relevant?
There are really just a lot of them.
Do you like the new ones?
I like the Rock, he makes them a bit more fun.
I think he makes the movies a bit silly.
He adds comic relief.
Since he started them, with his one liners they are way less serious.
I think they went down hill when Paul Walker passed away.
He made the movie more worthwhile.
I miss that guy, his story line was always the most full.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Fast and Furious movie?
No, you mean The Fate of the Furious?
Yeah number 8. Without Paul Walker. So sad.
Yeah it still kind of pulls at the heart. But no I haven't seen the new one.
I just can't bring myself to see it yet. I will probably wait until it comes out on DVD so I can cry in peace.
Well I don't know about cry, they are usually so action-packed that you don't have time to do much more than eat your popcorn and watch the screen.
You could be right. I just wish Paul Walker was still here. I hate it that he died like that. Well I do think the send off at the end of the last movie was touching and sweet.
It was. When he rode off into the sunset I think that said it all. It had to be hard to come up with an ending that would do him justice. I mean him and Vin Diesel were the movie.
Yeah, family. And in real life too. But I can't wait to see The Fate of the Furious. They have some new people in it like Charlize Theron that should be a good time.
I agree, maybe we'll see it together. Pop some popcorn and get some M&Ms and do it right. RIP Paul Walker.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What does Paul Walker play in the first movie?
He plays an undercover cop
Wow. That sounds pretty cool. I bet it is thrilling.
It is and he falls for a girl in it and everyone eventually finds out he is a cop.
Dodes the girl leave him after that?
No, because he helps save her brother Dominic.
Sounds cool. I love cars.
That movie is all about cars.
Who is another actor in it?
Michelle Rodriguez.
XXXXXXXXXXX
A lot of people tend to like the Fast & Furious series for the overall story.
Right. Are you getting to something.
I was going to ask you if you like any of the subplots of the movies.
Well, now that you mention it.
Well, go on.
I was kind of into the whole thing with Letty being brainwashed.
That was in number 6, right.
That's right. I liked the process of her going from being brainwashed to being back with her team.
I imagine that would be satisfying to watch.
Wait, so you haven't seen it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Fate of the Furious yet?
Which one is that?
The newest one, eighth in the installment.
Of course, that makes complete sense.
It stars Charlize Theron as Cipher.
Oh yes, I have seen it.  She is one of the best villains I think.
Yea, she did a great job, as she does in almost all her work.
It was sad to see a movie in the franchise without Paul.
Yea he will always be missed.
He did so much for the franchise and the scene in general.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you like Fast and the Furious?
Yeah I like some of them.
Which ones?
I like the 4th and 5th movies the best.
Which one is the one where they are in Brazil?
That is 5.
I like that one quite a bit.
Yeah definitely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite movie?
Definitely the fast and the furious
Those are great
They have so much action
I love watching the street races in them
I know it gives you a thrill that you dont get in real life
Exactly
Its so fun to watch
Especially winning or losing cars
Its so tense
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i wonder how many of those people get hurt
Hurt how
Well in the fast and furious movies
well they seem to be alright it seems
But those stunts are pretty rough
Well all stunts are
Yeah i wonder if they all use stunt doubles
Would not surprise me
Well they are trained for that
Pretty much
XXXXXXXXXXX
WOuld you like to come over tonight and watch Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift?
I'd love to as Tokyo Drift is my favorite of the series.
What is your favorite thing about F&F TD?
I love the cars and how they are tricked out.
My favorite part is the close up view of life in Tokyo.
Though I do find it a bit of a stretch to view Lucas Black as a teenager considering he was 24 when he made the movie.
I know but his character was great and I enjoyed seeing him learn how to drift.
The parking garage drift sequence was pretty impressive!
It was especially how they drifted around the spiral ramps.
I look forward to coming over and I'll bring the popcorn!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Fast & Furious car?
The Nissan Skyline GTR R34, hands down the best car in the movie. You?
The 350Z in Tokyo Drift.
Is Tokyo Drift your favorite Fast & Furious movie, if not which one?
Yes, Tokyo Drift is my favorite movie in that series. How about you?
I like the second movie, that's where they showed the silver R34.
Have you watched the newest Fast & Furious movie yet?
No, what is the movie called?
The Fate and the Furious, it's a must watch!
Oh wow, I will definitely check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man
Hey bro
I am thinking of starting the fast and furious series
They looking interesting to youu?
They look like something i would like
Well i can say they are pretty decent movies
Well that is glad to hear
You should start at the first and do not skip any of them though
I was actually gonna ask thanks for the advice
No problem man
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you like the fast and the furious?
I liked it a lot when I was in high school.
Don't like them now?
I haven't seen one in a long time.
What was the last one that you saw?
Maybe the 4th one?
The one in mexico?
Yeah I think so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Fast and Furious?
Yes!
Which is your favorite?
I love the first one.
Isn't Vin Diesel so good in those movies?
Totally he is!
I want to see it again.
We should see it together.
Sounds like a plan.
Alright!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Fast and Furious last night.
Not to be confused with The Fast and the Furious?
Right, this is number four.
Are Vinny Diesel and Paul Walker in it?
Yes.
What happens in the movie?
Walker and Diesel go after a drug lord.
Is Letty still there?
Yes, played by Michelle Rodriguez.
She is hot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like the new Fast & Furious?
It was ok, I really miss Paul Walker through.
Yes, that was a terrible shame.
The last FF movie was so sad.
Yes, that song at the end literally had me in tears.
What a beautiful man, such a shame.
I know right? But Vin Diesel is hott.
Heck yeah he is! I like the all the movies, they are all entertaining.
Yes, definately. Especially the special effects..
I can watch them all a few times each.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man i got to ask something i cannot figure out
What is on your mind
well i am trying to recall a specific actor
Well what movie
The guy who died who played on fast and the furious
Do you mean paul walker
Yeah him he was a pretty chill actor in the movies
Overall yea he was a good actor
I wish he lived to play in the rest he would make them much better
Definitely he would
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the fast and the furious?
Yes those are good movies
I cant believe paul walker is gone
I know its so sad
Im still suprised they came out with another movie after he died
Me too
It doesnt seem right
No it doesnt
Have you seen the last one?
No i haven't
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I think they should have stopped making the movies when Paul Walker died.
I don't know man, I think that's unfair to fans who didn't have him front and center, other characters have strong followings too.
Well, I don't see how it's not going to be on everyone's mind when they watch any of them from now on.
I think the character Dom is strong enough, and the fan base big enough they will be fine.
I guess but I still feel it's a bit tacky.
It's business, and the movies are mostly about the cars and the mods and hey, in that lifestyle, people die.
We'll see, I guess ratings will drop if people agree with me more.
I'm still going to go see every one they make.
Are they making another one?
Talking about it or a spin off series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let us talk about the Fast and the Furious.
I never seen any.
What?
That is true.
You know nothing about them?
All I know is Vin Diesel is in it and it is an action film.
Oh my goodness you have to watch them!
Maybe I will some day.
We should watch the first one together.
Sounds like a plan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the latest Fast and Furious movie?
Not yet, have you?
No, but I saw other ones.
How were they?
They were really sweet.
How so?
Vin Diesel is just an incredible actor.
That's true.  The movie must be so action packed.
You're not kidding.  I haven't seen Fate of the Furious yet, but it's next on my list.
Hey, lets see that one together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember which Fast and Furious didn't have Jordana Brewster?
I think she was in all of them except 2 Fast 2 Furious and the most recent one, The Fate of the Furious.
I wonder if she'll ever return. I really like her character of Mia Torretto.
Same here, I'm a big fan of hers. I can understand how they would feel it being out of place if she was in there without Paul Walker's Brian.
Such a tragic lost. I know what you mean. It does seem with every Fast and Furious they're introducing a new character.
That's how you keep a franchise going! You keep the main stars and you slowly introduce new ones so the audience can grow attached!
I am definitely glad the Rock got to be a part of the universe. Ever since Fast 5 I've been on the Rock train the whole way!
The Rock is great! He's beyond ridiculous as each movie goes on but in a fun positive way.
I hope he stays with the franchise until the 10th? I think that's how many they said they were going to make.
I heard 10 also. I bet if they continue doing well at the box office we'll get spin offs. That'll be fun for all Fast and Furious fans!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Have you seen any of the fast and furious movies?
Yeah I've seen some.
Have you seen the one that just came out?
No I haven't seen it yet.  Have you?
I plan on going to see it in the theaters.
Oh, I don't think it got very good reviews.
Yeah I saw that but I don't care.
Ok.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like movies?
Yes I do Like movies
Have you seen that race car one?
The fast and the furious?
Yeah that movie is really good.
It is so sad that that Paul Walker died.
Yes I can't believe it.
What was your favorite car?
Mine was the red car Toretto had.
That my also my favorite one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Fast and Furious.
I've seen that movie. What did you think?
I thought it was good.
Yeah, I really like the interplay between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.
I do, too. It's funny that they have to work together even though they're enemies.
I know that is really funny, plus the action is really good.
Yeah, it is.  I can't believe Paul Walker is dead now.
I know it's so crazy to think about when you watch the movies.
It is really sad.
I know, I was really sad when he died.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the last Fast and Furious movie?
No not yet.  Whats that one called again?
Its called The Fate of the Furious.
Do you think that's going to be the last one?
I'm not sure.  I think they said it would be the last one but they seem to just keep churning them out.
It was really sad when Paul Walker died.
It was.  I really liked the ending of Fast and Furious 7 where they did kind of like a little tribute to him.
Oh yeah that was really cool.  I wonder how they did those scenes since he was already dead?
I think they used a lot of CGI but I know his brothers stepped in and filmed some for him.
That's so cool that they can do stuff like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How was the Fate of the Furious?
It was good. The submarine scene was crazy.
Which sequel did Gal Gadot's character die again?
It was in Fast and Furious 6. Pretty sad.
Roman Pearce has to be the funniest character in the Fast & Furious Franchise.
His best scenes were with Paul Walker's character.
What is the best car chase in the fast & furious films?
It has to be the tank chase in Fast & Furious 6.
Dwayne Johnson stole the movie in Fast Five.
His fight scene with Vin Diesel was epic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Vin Diesel's acting in The Fast and the Furious?
Yes, he played it very well.
I agree.
He plays a good tough guy.
Paul Walker was a great person to play opposite him.
I liked the way their relationship formed
They played it very well.
The filmmakers should be proud of that film.
I think so too and part 2 and 3.
The second and third one are good. I like how they take the characters and stayed true to the original.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
You see the new fast and furious movie yet?
No I haven't.
Me either.
What number are they up to now?
I think it's 8.
Wow 8 films.
Yeah didn't realize it was that many.
Me either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the truck heist from Fast & Furious 4?
Yes of course, who doesn't?
Didn't the driver of the truck have an iguana?
Yes he did and hit ate a piece of chocolate.
That's crazy I didn't know Iguanas ate chocolate.
Me either could just be for the scene.
I liked the part when the truck blew up and rolled down the road and Dom sped up and drove under it.
I loved that scene I thought they would be crushed.
I think that's my favorite scene of that specific movie.
Yeah it was very well done.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How well do you think The Rock fits into the Fast & Furious movies?
He is the only person I can see playing Hobbs in those movies.
He does bring a certain level of awesome to the film.
Totally, he's strong enough to be menacing but still able to make the jokes seem realistic.
He usually does play big goofy guys that still ends up kicking your teeth in.
What was your favorite Hobbs moment, any film?
It would have to be when he was in prison with Statham.
When Jason was saying how easy it would be on to beat up The Rock?
Yeah, then Hobbs just ribs the bench out of the wall and starts lifting it like weights.
The look on Jason's face was priceless; of course, The Rocks face was just as good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw 2 Fast 2 Furious.
Was Vinnie Diesel in it?
No, he was doing xXx.
Who directed?
John Singleton.
Who was the hottie?
The great Eva Mendes.
What happens in the movie?
Walker is a fugitive from the LAPD but works with the FBI to bring down a drug lord and clear himself.
Setting up for number three.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the latest Fast and Furious, The Fate of the Furious?
I caught it last night!
That's great, I caught it a few weeks ago. What were your impressions of it?
I really enjoyed it. I liked Charlize Theron as the villain. She is so smooth.
She's definitely one of my favorites and it was fun to see her in the Fast and the Furious universe now. Cypher!
I was hoping to see more action sequences from her because you know she can do some really cool stunts. They kept her as more of the intellectual villain.
I loved her interactions with Dom and how she was manipulating his motivations to turn against his family and team.
The whole movie I was trying to figure out what exactly did she have on him to make him turn considering he's probably the most loyal character in the series.
I know! I was guessing the whole way. I really enjoyed that mystery aspect of it, but let's not forget about the crazy action sequences!
I can't forget about that! That's why we go watch the Fast and the Furious!
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you watched fate of the furious?
yes and i think it is an  awesome movie..
couldn't agree more but there is one thing i don't like about it
what?
the way the preview tell you everything about the  movie
IKR??
yeah man,there is nothing to anticipate for in the movie
so which one do you think is the best of them?
still think the third one was
i still stick to the second one
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift?
No, I haven't seen that one.
It's pretty good, you should watch it.
Didn't that come out a while ago?
Yeah it came out in 2006.
Wow that's so long ago. What's it about?
It's about the underground racing scene in Japan and how a troubled teen gets involved with it.
It sounds pretty good.  Who's in it?
Bow Wow and Lucas Black
I'll have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Fast & Furious 6.
What did you think?
I thought it was really good!
Me too!  What did you like most about it?
I really liked the set and how amazing it looked against the racing cars.
Yeah that was really cool.  They really outdid themselves with the special effects this time.
I also really liked the addition of Luke Evans and his character.
He really added to the plot being the mastermind of the mercernaries.
Yeah it was crazy. I'm glad you told me to watch it.
You're welcome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Have you seen any of the fast and the furious movies?
Yeah I think I've seen them all or at least most of them.
Do you have one you like the best?
The last one was pretty good.
7?
Yeah I think so.
There was that sad part at the end?
With Paul Walker?  Yeah that was very sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Fate of the Furious yet?
I am planning on going to watch it this weekend with my family.
I won't spoil anything, but I think you're in for a pleasant surprise.
I take it that means that you liked it.
I liked it a lot.
Alright, well I'll go in with good expectations.
If you liked the last 3, you'll definitely love this one.
That just got me excited.
Which of the last 3 was your favorite?
Fast Five without a doubt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite fast and furious movie?
I really like the first one
Me too where you find out everything
It hooks you in from the beginning
Yes it does
The first one is great
I really like them all though
Me too
They are exciting
Exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear they are planning on making more Fast and the Furious movies?
Wow, how long are they going to milk that franchise?
It is still going strong, one of the most popular action movie series.
They should really consider ending it.
Have you been watching the newer ones?
No I have not.
They are actually really good, better than the originals.
The originals were terrible so no surprise there.
I think the new ones are coming out in 2019 and 2021.
That is still so far away, they already announced that?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you think Letti was actually dead ?
I never really questioned it until the 6th movie.
I was like what?!?!
I know right. Such a plot twist.
I really like Letty so I'm glad they brought her back.
Me too, she's such a strong character.
I was so sad to see she didn't remember Dom though.
At least she still falls in love with him again !
True, that was a plus.
The poor cop lady he was with though. She basically got pushed to the side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched the latest Fast and Furious?
Yes I have. Actually I only watched the first one and the last one, that is until Vin Diesel decided to make another one haha.
Did you like it?
I liked it. It was pretty good. I like Vin Diesel turning kinda bad in some parts of the movies, but I don't want to give away the ending if you haven't watched it.
Any good car chases?
Obviously! There were a few. One was where they were going through downtown and ended up in a stand off and another big finale was towards the end of the movie. It was a bit over the top though.
I also like Ludacris' character, he adds comedy to the movie.
I think they all did. I loved the love and hate relationship between The Rock and Jason Statham.
Yeah the tough guys good guys thing.
I think they're all a good team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which movie from the Fast & Furious franchise did you enjoy the most?
I actually liked the first one the most.
Why is that one your favorite?
Well it's the first one so it was all new it had never been done before and we didn't know what to expect, plus they did an awesome job.
That's a good point, the first movie was a roller coaster for me.
I felt the same, after that you kind of knew what to expect.
Is it one of your favorite movies.
Yes, though it's not my most favorite movie.
Do you ever wonder what it would be like to be in that movie to be Dom or Brian?
I think I would have liked to be Dom he's such an interesting character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
you wanna know something
Sure tell me
Well i think the lead actor is not that good
The lead actor in what
The guy who stars in the fast and the furious
Vin diesal?
Yeah he is not that good
I do not know i love him
He just seems out of place
How is he out of place he is perfect
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which was the last Fast & Furious movie you saw?
Furious 7.
That was good. Sad though.
You're talking about the scene when Dom and Brian drive in different directions?
That's the one.
Made me feel awful for Paul Walker.
A real tragedy.  They shouldn't have been racing.
I don't know the circumstances but I agree.
Then now there's another film.  The Fate of the Furious.
I guess the whole franchise has been a huge moneymaker.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite fast and furious movie is fast five
When did that one come out
In 2011
Wheres that one take place
Rio di jianaro
Oh okay, i think i remember that one
I think its the best one
Its the one after they got dom out of custody, right?
Yes thats the one
It was a good one
XXXXXXXXXXX
so which one is your favorite fast and furious movie?
I think it is 2 fast 2 furious.
Oh, I think that is the only part in which there is no vin diesel
no, I think tokyo drift is another one without vin diesel
oh, are you sure?
yes, I am pretty sure.
I thought tokyo drift had vin diesel, may be briefly.
actually it is the first movie in which they show jason statham.
really? When did they show jason statham in tokyo drift?
It was in post credit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Fast and furious 8?
I watched it, but I couldn't really get into it.
What didn't you understand?
I didn't really think that Dom would leave his girlfriend like that.
Well, he was blackmailed, so he didn't have a choice.
Yeah, but the other woman wasn't his life long soul mate.
She had his kid, though.
He didn't know that when he started the whole rebellion adventure.
I didn't think it was a bad movie.
I don't think it was bad, it just wasn't as good as some of the others.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite scene in the series
The one in the second movie with the break in
That is one tight scene
I honestly am impressed with it
I also like the chase scenes
Those are intense like nail biting
I really love the tensity of them
I hope the series keeps going
same dude
It is one of my favorite series
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man what is good
Nothing much watching some movies
What movies
The first fast and furious movie
I absolutely love that one
It is the best still to me
I do not like most of the sequels
They were not that bad
Some of them were come on
Not really man
XXXXXXXXXXX
I could talk about my love for the Fast & Furious series all day.
I wish I could say the same.
You're not a fan?
Not too much. Action movies just aren't my type.
Well, that's fine. There's more to it than just action.
Such as what?
There's plenty of drama in it, and there's also a bit of family-oriented stuff in there as well.
I don't know. The action seems to outweigh everything else.
Oh, then I guess you won't really like the films much.
I thought about the same thing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Fast & Furious movie was Jesse in?
The first one: The Fast & The Furious
Where does 2 Fast 2 Furious take place
That's the one in Miami, Florida
What car does Brian finally beat Dom in?
2011 Dodge Charger in Fast 5
What was Dom's girlfriends name in The Fast & The Furious
Letty
Who drove the purple gen 3 Mitsubishi Eclipse in 2 Fast 2 Furious
That's Brian's childhood friend Roman Pierce
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you hear about paul walker?
Oh yes, I did, I was so sad to hear it.
At first I could not believe it.
Me too. I thought it was just a prank.
So what will happen to current fast and furious movie?
Yes, I had the same question.
I think they will just kill him in movie.
well, for that they will have to modify the story of the movie.
Oh yes, But what else can they do?
I don't know, may be they can use body double or something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Fast and Furious movies?
Yes, I do, although I prefer the first movies.
I liked the first movies as well but think that the rock is a great addition to the team.
Yeah, him and Statham are great actors but I didnt like the last two movies.
I thought the last two movies were ok, I didnt like the visual effects they were just too loaded.
I miss the days that Fast and Furious was simple.
I know, I miss those days two.
So whats your favorite Fast and Furious movie.
I  liked the first and second movies the most what about you?
My favorite was definetely the second movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Fast & Furious movies
I did, up until number 6.  They just got too crazy.
I agree.  They are what got me into cars.
Yeah, they were so cheesy but it helped get a whole new generation into the car scene.
Yep, I was even crazy enough to get street-glow on my car
Oh, I am so sorry.  You must regret that.
I really do.  Have you seen the new one yet?
No I haven't.  I doubt I will.
It's just not the same without Paul.
I agree.  They need to stop making them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happens at the end of The Fast and the Furious?
I will not tell you. You have to watch it?
Is there a lot of drama in it?
There is tons of drama.
What is the best part?
The street race near the beginning?
Does Paul Walker win it?
Watch the movie.
I will.
The whole movie is suspenseful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite fast and furious movie?
The 1st one and the one that takes place in Brazil.
Yeah those were cool, they had lots of action.
I liked when big safe of money was being chased in Brazil.
Oh yeah, big action scene.
So much action!
Who is your favorite character?
Vin Diesel.
Oh yeah, I like Ludacris.
Because he's so manly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I haven't seen furious 7 yet
Me either
Ive been afraid to
Me tooi want ro see it though
Yea ive always wondered what they did with paul walker
Me too
If they killed him in the movie its wven sadder because he was dead in real life
I know
It sucks
Yes i agree with that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what year the movie "Fast & Furious " came out?
I believe it came out in 2009.  It was right after Tokyo Drift.
I believe this was Paul Walker's best acting performance when speaking of the fast and furious movies.
I agree with you. He was really strong in this movie.
I also think Michelle Rodriquez did well in this movie. She matched well with Vin Diesel.
That is so true. They look like a match made in heaven. They were so into each other.
Did you see the types of cars they use in this movie? I was really feeling the Buick GNX.
It was a nice car but I liked the Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R that  was in the movie.
I'm sure they enjoyed driving those cars. It sure looks like a lot of fun.
Tell me about it. I need all those cars in my life some day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The whole Fast & Furious series of movies changed the way I looked at cars forever.
I know, I see a car similar to any from the movies and it takes me back to some scene.
They really shouldn't have made any without Vin Deisel.
I don't know that he was too interested at the time.
No, I suppose not, but I am glad he got over that.
Have you ever watched many in a row?
I have, and I always notice that Dom's arms just grow significantly.
Do you think it was steroids?
I don't nkow, probably, or maybe it's me, jealous, that I will never have his arms.
Just keep working out, and eat your vegetables.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like you the first "The Fast and the Furious"?
Yes! That was best movie of all the fast and furious movies. Brian Walker was just starting out and did a great job.
I actually liked the first movie because of Vin Diesel. I personally think he made the movie a blast.
Vin Diesel was good but all the actors in the movie made it a great success.
The story line was also great because what movie about cars is not great?
That is so true. I haven't seen a movie that involves cars that was not great?
This movie started the beginning of many fast and furious movies to come.
Tell me about it. Now there's like eight of them out now. I liked Ja Rule character as well.
Ja Rule was alright in the movie but I think any rapper could play his part.
I believe Ja Rule was uniquely fitted for that position.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh man, you know the Fast and The Furious movie?
THE movie? More like which one of dozens, am I right?
Haha yeah, how many do they have?
I think eight by now
Oh yeah! That recent one came out right?
Yeah, what was the name of it?
The Fate of the Furious
Did you already see it?
Yeah, last month.
Nice, I only saw up to Furious 7
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Fate of the Furious?
Is that the newest Fast and the Furious movie?
Yea, it was pretty great, one of my favorites.
I have not seen any of those movies since the third one.
Really?  Since Tokyo Drift?
You picked the worst time to stop, it got way better after that.
I thought it got pretty silly so I couldn't get myself to keep watching them.
The newer ones are pretty much action movies, less about racing.
That is interesting, all I remember were the racing scenes.
You should give them a shot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see the new Fast & Furious film?
Maybe. It's not the same without Paul Walker.
Agreed, but the movies are always good, no matter the cast.
I know. Vin Diesel is my favorite actor.
Really? Mine is Dwayne Johnson.
You can't go wrong with that cast!
I know! And the action is amazing.
They sure are highly budgeted films.
Do you think they will make a ninth film?
No, I doubt it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need more movies based on cars
Why do you say that bro
Well their is only one series that comes to mind
What series
Fast and the furious
but that is a pretty good series
it is so its a shame it is one of its kind
Well nothing can compete with its quality
The last one was the only bad one
Even that one was not that bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Fast and Furious movies. I have seen them all at least once.
Yes, I have seen each of them during opening week. I love the action and the cars.
I thought it was sad that they lost Paul Walker but I think they handled it well.
Yes, I agree. They did a nice wrap up on his storyline for the fans.
Man, when Dom drove off in one direction and Brian the other at the end I was in tears.
To be frank that is not why I go to those movies. It is all about the cars and the capers they pull.
They have some of the greatest car stunts I have ever seen. I love to watch it on the big screen.
There is nothing like it. The sound of the cars racing and chasing is amazing.
The characters are all well done, but the cars are the stars as far as I am concerned.
As long as they keep topping themselves with those stunts they will have a fan in me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy the fast and the furious movies?
Yes they were very exciting!
I am so sad though now that paul walker died.
That is terrible! He was so handsome.
Vin diesel was good in the movies too.
I should really watch them again just to see those to racing their cars really fast.
I agree, Tokyo drift was ok
All of the movies before that one were great!
Really went downhill after paul walker
Yep, he held everything together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I liked Fast Five, but miss the focus on street racing.
Me too, but I can forgive it for that film, it was so good and funny even.
I think it was the one in the series that made the most money.
I think you are right.
I wonder if you asked the actors if it would be their favorite.
I think Vin Diesel has stated that it is, but I'm not sure, I'd have to look it up.
What an insanely fun set of movies to work on, I bet it would be a hard choice for any of the actors to pick a favorite.
I think it would be more fun to be a stunt driver on those films!
True, I wonder if any of the stunt drivers have been hurt.
I bet insurance would take good care of them if they were.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the most recent Fast and Furious movie?
I haven't yet. I plan to, though. You saw it?
I did. I wasn't sure if I was going to after Paul Walker's accident.
That's kind of why I haven't seen it yet. I think it'll just be too sad.
That's what I thought, too. And it was sad, for sure.
I bet. The whole thing with the way he died is just so ironic.
I know. Too much like the movies, but no happy ending.
But the movie was good?
It was. I actually feel better because they had a really beautiful tribute to Paul in it. It was very well-done and emotional.
Wow, I really respect that they did that. He deserved it. He was a good guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What about fast & furious makes you want to watch it?
Action packed and all my favorite characters.
What about the action makes you thrilled to see it?
It makes you feel like you are there, and makes you want to start racing like them.
How many of the fils did you currently see?
The first, second and two others and not sure of there names.
What was you favorite scene in fast & furious
The first movie where all the cars pull up nd they switch vehicles to escape the cops. Loved it
Does fast & furious ever bring memories to your life?
My father works on cars and loves to rev engines. Everytime he revs an engine, i think of the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Vin Diesel in the Fast and the Furious?
Oh yeah. He was so cool.
Is he in anything else?
Yeah, I remember him in Pitch Black
That was a cool movie.
He brings that coolness to every role and he brought it to The Fast and the Furious.
Did you like his car in part 1?
Yes, it was cool. I liked the red.
Did you think his character would ever get killed off during the movies?
I thought so, since he did some crazy things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the latest Fast & Furious film?
It's ok but it's getting a little ridiculous now.
What do you mean?
They keep going more over the top with the action.
Oh, it's getting too unrealistic?
Basically, yes, but it's getting too far away from its roots.
You mean the car racing stuff?
Yes, they went away from car racing and focus on heists more now.
Yeah, I liked the first film the best because it was just simple and fun.
Agreed, it used to be about fast, cool cars instead of all this other stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that plane scene in the end of fast and furious 5?
Yes, I did.
It seems like it was infinite runway.
Yes, I mean the last 15 minutes was plane running on runway.
They should add that runway to world record.
I don't see such flaws in english movies usually.
Yes, Even I was surprised to see that scene.
But how was the movie otherwise besides that scene?
Well, I haven't seen any movie turn out to be good which has problems with ending.
I agree, A bad ending is usually the entire movie killer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I didn't really care for the fast and the furious franchise.
Really?  Why?
Well, it's a bunch of racers.  How entertaining can that really be?
Don't you watch the Indy 500?
No way!! It's all just rednecks and left hand turns.
But it can be exciting, especially when there is a wreck
Yes but why would you want to watch a car accident?
Well, there is definitely more to fast and furious than left hand turns and car accidents.
I suppose, but I still don't like the idea of a racing movie.
To each their own i guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Fast and Furious?
Yes. It's been a while.
Who is in it? Name one person.
Van Diesel.
What year was it released?
2002.
Wrong.
2000?
No. It was released in the year 2001.
That's a long time ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many movies are in The Fast and the Furious franchise?
Eight
Are they all good?
Yes and the first one is the best.
How many directors did it have?
There have been 5 so far.
What is the name of Vin Diesel's character?
Dom
There were a lot of stunts in that movie.
Yes and it was very thrilling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I haven't seen all of them.  I guess I should.
Well, It's hard to beat the original.
I agree.  I think they got a little carried away with all the sequels.
They did.  Some of them are good.  But I like the ones with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel the best.
Yeah.  Aren't there like six or seven?
Yep.  And they are planning more.  Without Paul Walker I just don't think they will be the same.
No, he just made the movies what they were.
Vin Diesel can't be replaced either.  If you lose both of those characters, I really don't think you will have much of a fan base.
Hopefully he will be included in the new ones.  I'd love to see him have more of a presence.
Yeah, I might actually make an effort to watch them then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess what movie I just watched last night?
No idea, lay it on me.
The original Fast and the Furious was on TV.
Wow, I have not seen that movie since it was in the theaters.
Yea, it was out when we were in high school.
I can not believe it has been so long.
I really enjoyed it when I first watched it.
Of course, we were all into cars and the modding culture.
That movie really did a lot for tuners.
Yea, it somewhat started the whole import craze here.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just don't know what to think about the Fast and The Furious films now?
I think I know what you mean, but you need to elaborate some more.
Well, look at the first film.  It was a decent action film revolving around racing and fast cars.
It also revolved around "family" as "Dom" always likes to say.
Right.  The stunts were great, but for the most part everything was believable.
Which is the complete opposite of what they are doing now.
Exactly!  In the Fast Five film, there was a scene where they were using their cars to drag a sealed bank vault down a busy street!
In the Fate of The Furious, the Rock's character manhandled a torpedo.  I love it.
Maybe it is because I am getting old, but I like my action scenes to be more realistic.
I want to see how much farther the movies will push the envelope.  Will space be the final frontier for the movies?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the fast and the furious movies?
To be honest I've never seen any past the first one.
Me either! But I do like the podcast how did this get made.
Me too! I love listening to them make fun of Vin Deisel.
That is the best part.
What did you think of Paul Walker?
Paul Walker was great.
I agree. I also like the girl who is kind of butch.
Michelle Rodriguez. Is that the one?
Yes, her! She's great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Paul Walker was so cute in Fast and Furious.
I like Vin Diesel better.
How many movies have they made now?
I don't know maybe like 8. Furious 8 I think is what they were working on when Paul Walker died.
I thought it was neat how they still kept him in the film
Yes, it was. Did I hear his brother was a stand in for some of the stuff that hadn't been filmed yet?
I'm not sure about that.
Me either, I sure hate to see it end though
Well I heard Liam Nesson was going to be in the next one.
That might be an interesting character change
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in the Fast & Furious franchise?
I would have to say Dom.
He is a great character, why do you like him so much?
Well he's like a double sided blade one side is rough and tough the other side is soft and sentimental.
That's a very good point, I never thought of him like that.
Well he makes all these decisions to appear as this bad guy especially early on, then he always makes the morally right choice when it matters.
That's a very good point.  He is this brutal person yet so moral when it matters.
That's why he is my favorite.
I might have to watch the movies again.
Yeah you're making me nostalgic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let us talk about the Fast and the Furious.
Okay!
Which is your favorite one out of all of them?
I like number 6.
Really?
Yeah I think it was very interesting.
I was not on the edge of my seat for that one.
Well that is you though.
Very true.
It was great talking to you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Owen and Deckard Shaw will return for the next Fast and Furious?
You mean Luke Evans and Jason Statham's characters?
Yeah I hope those two will return. It's odd that in The Fate of the Furious they became good after all the turmoil from the Furious 7 and the one before.
I think they will return. I really liked what they did with Jason Statham's character.
Me too! I liked that they gave him more action sequences. That whole scene on the plane with the baby was great in Fate of the Furious!
That scene was hilariously over the top but I loved it!
He was even at the lunch at Dom's house at the end!
That was a little weird. I get that he helped them because they helped him and his brother but that scene at the end with all of them so happy was a bit off.
I think you have to understand it goes back to Dom's loyalty to family and Deckard showing he holds the same value. So they found a common point between them.
You're right. I didn't think about that. I think We'll have Deckard returning as part of the crew from here on out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Fast & Furious movies?
Yes, quite a bit.
I like them as well.
Who is your favorite character.
I like the character Paul Walker played.
That is my favorite as well.
It is too bad he passed away in that accident.
It sure is.
We lost a good one there.  I don't think the movies will be the same going forward.
No, they definitely won't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe how many fast and the furious movies there are?
I know, it’s almost crazy that they keep making them but they are so good!
Which one is your favorite and which one is your least favorite?
I would say number 1 is my favorite because it’s the original and number 2nis my least favorite?
Really? You don’t like number 2?
I thought it had the worst acting and the bad guy was not a good bad guy.
I know what you mean, the bad guy is a little weak in that movie.
What about you? What’s your favorite?
I would have to say number 6! I don’t know why, it just is my favorite.
Yes, I know what you mean, number 6 has a great story line.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Fast and Furious movies?  Do you like them?
Yes I do.  I started watching the whole movies when Fast 5 came out.
Really?  I remember I liked that one, but some people criticized it.
Yeah, I loved that movie.  They drove the car off a cliff!
That was amazing.  I liked that scene too.
And then there was the part at the end when they dragged the big safe through the city streets in Brazil.
Yeah, I have a hart time understanding people who don't like that.
Haha, me too!  It was amazing and I never understand people who don't like that!
Who did you watch it with?
I watched it at the theater with a friend and his other friend, then recently I watched it with my mother.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw he Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.
Was Vinny Diesel in it?
Yes, but only in the end.  Paul Walker was not in it.
Interesting.  Anybody else from number 1 and 2?
No.
Who directed it?
Justin Lin.
Who played the main charaacter?
Lucas Black, with Natalie Kelley as his girlfriend.
I saw her on CSI.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Tokyo Drift.
Yes I did.
I really liked it.
Yes I did too.
I wonder why it got bad reviews.
I thought the lead actor did a great job.
Yes I really enjoyed it.
Yes I like that it was filmed in Tokyo.
Yes it was a great movie.
Yes it was fun to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see all of the Fast & Furious movies?
I have seen most of them.
Which ones have you not watched?
I did not see Toyko drift or 2 Fast 2 Furious
But you saw all the other ones?
Yes. I know it is odd to jump them like that but oh well.
Do you think they should have continued on after Paul Walker passed away?
I think that finishing the movie they were making was the right thing to do.
How many more do you think they will make?
Who knows! As long as they keep making money!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the fast and the furious movies?
Yea, I saw the first couple I think.
How did you like Tokyo Drift?
It was not my favorite.
Yea. It felt a little out of place to me.
Same. Did you see all of them?
All but the last one that just came out.
That's cool. Does Tokyo Drift fit in the series better after you have seen most of the movies?
Yea it fit in better. It helps you understand the characters more.
Oh ok. I will have to watch them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever watch the Fast and Furious movies?
Only every year, or when I want to be surrounded by awesomeness.
True, what do you think of Letty?
You mean Michelle Rodriguez?
Yes, I always wish she had more stunts in the movies.
I know just what you mean, but that fit scene in the dress was epic.
Totally amazing, who played that girl though? Wasn't it some UFC chick or something?
It was Ronda Rousey man, you know, the Champion UFC chick.
Whoa really, that just makes it even cooler.
No what makes it cooler is I just got the full series on blue-ray, do you feel the need?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the first movie in the Fast and Furious series?
Oh yes, back when it was first released!
Who was your favorite character?
Brian - who was yours?
I really like Letty.  She is the only one who can contain Dom.
She's not the only one, Brian really reigned in him too.
But, Brian let him go at the end.
That is true, but they did team up again in later movies.
The soundtrack for the first will always be my favorite though.
I still like the soundtrack from the seventh movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Fast & Furious movies?
I think that they're basically superhero movies.
How so?
Well, they're all basically indestructible.  No matter how many car crashes or other accidents, they always leave unscathed.
That's a good point.  Pretty much no one in the core group, besides Han, died.
Remember that scene in 'Fast Five' where Dom and Brian drive off a bridge and survive?
Yea, that was pretty ridiculous.  Or the scene in the 7th where they drive through 3 buildings.
I'm pretty sure the laws of physics don't apply to any of these characters.
Also, now I'm reminded of the fact that The Rock's character gets shot by rubber bullets in the latest movie, and just shrugs it off.
Like I said, they're superheroes!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift?
Yes at first it was off putting since it was new characters but I got used to it.
Yeah that was a little off putting for me too.
I did like the drifting and different race styles that was in that movie.
Speaking of that do you remember the first race of the movie?
The one where Sean Boswell I think his name is was racing?
Yes, I actually liked his character.
Yeah he was a good installment to the franchise.
I just remember him trying to learn to drift and crashing into all kinds of things in that first one.
Yeah that was a good part in the movie showing how even people have to learn in movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like dwane johnson?
Yes, sort of.
Have you seen fast and furious series?
I am not sure if I have seen the whole series.
Okay, so have you seen the one in which dwayne jhonson is there?
I think I have seen one.
Did you like it?
Yes, it was good.
Do you think he used steroids for that role?
I think, I mean I don't thing you can achieve that kind of body naturally.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate most things to do with racing
Why it is so boring to me to be honest
Then why do you seem to be into the fast and the furious so much
Because Vin is awesome
Well i guess i cannot disagree with that
He is one of the more real actors out their
What do you mean real
Like he is relatable and understandable
Well yeah he is down to earth guy in interviews too
He is really calm and hilarious
XXXXXXXXXXX
That scene with the truck though in the movie is amazing
I love that scene it is so intense
I know is it something special
I honestly thought something would go wrong
It was begging for something to go wrong
I know right
Just one of the best scenes in the whole series
I know i was expecting him to fall of the moving truck
Precisely what i thought
I know man it was tense
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I saw the new Fast and Furious.
Oh, there's a new one?
Yeah.
I guess there's always a new one.
Yeah, they're kind of starting over now because --
Wasn't there one set in Japan, that was all about drifting?
Yeah, Tokyo Drift.
I saw the previews for that. It reminded me of Tokyo Xtreme Racer.
That's... what?
Oh, right. You didn't own a Dreamcast, did you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am keen on the main actor for the fast and furious series
Which one
I like Vin diesal
He is really good at acting
he makes the persona come to life
It is as if he is the person he is portraying
I know it is pretty wonderful
Overall i want to see more of his movies
Well he is in a lot of the movies
You know what i mean
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hmmm i am not so sure i like this movie
What movies are you watching
Well i got bored so i decided to binge watch a series
What series did you binge watch
Fast and the furious series i am just not getting it
Yeah binge watching them may not be the best idea
I know now that i have
Yeah they are best in moderate doses
I am gonna try to watch the rest with breaks might enjoy them more
Hopefully you do
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the newest Fast and Furious movie?
I haven't actually. The Fate of the Furious, right?
Yeah! That is the one!
Was it any good?
It wasn't my favorite, but I liked it quite a bit.
I just can't imagine the series without Brian.
I know, it was pretty sad. Dom named his baby after him, though.
Dom has a baby!?
Oh shoot! I am sorry that I spoiled it.
It's okay. I will definitely have to watch it now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The latest 'Fast' movie felt rather empty with Brian, Paul Walker's character.
I absolutely agree.  I am just glad that the send-off was so good in 7.
It was truly an emotional and touching farewell.
I liked that Dom named his new baby after Brian in the latest movie.
I did as well, though I don't think it necessarily made sense.
How so?
Well in that movie universe, Brian is technically still alive and has just retired.  By that logic, why would they tribute the baby with Brian's name?
Oh wow that's actually an excellent point.
I think it would have made more sense to name the baby, Paul.
I agree.  That way, it is a tribute to Paul Walker but it also makes sense in terms of the movie's story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow i have never seen one of these before but it is pretty intense
seen what before
The fast and the furious movies
Oh yeah those are pretty rad
I love paul walker
He is pretty amazing
Shame that it happened
What happened
Him passing
Oh i had not know about that actually
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think about the Fast and the Furious movies? Do you like them?
Yes I do! I LOVE them!
Do you have any particular ones you love? And Why?
I love the Tokyo drift one! It actually has a different setting. I won't say exotic, but seeing them drifting and whatnot on Tokyo streets is very interesting.
I personally do not like it. The plot is kind of weak.
Well okay, which one do you like the most then?
I love Furious 7! Paul Walker was partially still in it!
Why do you like it better than the others?
Call me bias, I think it is because it is the last movie Paul Walker was in prior to his accident.
I understand. He was a good actor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, I heard that the new Fast & Furious movie reached 1 billion worldwide box office.
That is a big achievement, although I do not like the movie very much.
Yeah, the domestic box office of the movie is not that great, but it tops in other countries such as China, with more than 300 millions.
With such a high box office, I wish they could really think about how to make the movie fun and entertaining.
There have been so many movies in the series. Maybe they need to think about other storylines.
I agree. I heard that they are thinking about using other characters for the next movie in the franchise.
Dwayne Johnson's character, Hobbs.
That seems to be interesting. I like the actor very much.
They may also put Jason Statham's character Deckard Shaw into the movie as well.
Great. I should wait to see the next Fast & Furious movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did you think about Fast & Furious 7 ?
That's the one where Paul Walker was still alive right ?
Yea he was able to act for some of the movie, his brother had to do the rest with the help of CGI.
Wow, I couldn't even tell that it wasn't Paul himself acting.
Yes, the movie was done so well a long with the outstanding acting from the crew.
Yep, so who was you're favorite character in the movie ?
Well if i'm being honest it would be Paul.
Me too, it's sad he passed away.
What do you think about their decision about containing the series ?
I think that it was a great spot to stop at in the story-line and with Paul gone,but we'll have to see how it goes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many movies are in the Fast series anyway?
They started in 2001, and had 7 sequels since, not counting the shorts.
They made short films too?
Yep. They were just filler type of shorts. Not that good.
These movies made over 5 billion buvks
Yep., It's the 6th highest grossing film franchise of ALL time.
That's right behind the Tolkien's series.
Yep. people do love nice cars and stealing stuff
Good ol' family fun
Nothing says friedns like stealing stuff together in nice cars, all modded up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've always felt that the Fast & Furious films have had great settings.
I can agree with that. The settings always add so much more to the movie overall.
Absolutely. Do you have a favorite?
Yes. For me, it's Tokyo Drift.
I wanted to say that too! I thought seeing them race through the streets of Japan looked absolutely gorgeous.
You took the words from my mouth there. It was a great experience.
Do you have a second place for setting?
Well, because I absolutely love Dubai, I'm going to say Furious 7.
But that movie wasn't only in Dubai.
That's true, but the time that they were in Dubai was great, I thought.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, can you believe they've come out with eight Fast & Furious movies?
Hey man, if it works, I don't see why they should stop making them. Fast 7 and the Fate of the Furious both grossed over a billion dollars.
Jeez, don't you think they're kind of milking the franchise? I mean, I can't see them making any more movies without Paul Walker.
Not really, if it's not broken, don't fix it. Anyways, do you happen to have a favorite Fast & Furious movie?
Honestly, I really like the first The Fast and the Furious movie. I have vivid memories of it because my dad took me to see it on my birthday.
Good choice man, but I'd have to say Fast 7 was my favorite movie. I really like the soundtrack too, See You Again is a great song.
Don't you think that song is a little played out? Charlie Puth sounds like generic pop to me.
I think that's a little disrespectful to say man, the song is a real touching tribute to Paul Walker's memory. Brian will forever be immortalized by that song.
No disrespect to Paul Walker, I'm just a little tired of hearing that song everyday on the radio.
I see what you mean, and respect your entitlement to an opinion. If they keep coming out with movies, I'll keep watching them till Fast 70 is out and I'm an 82-year-old grandpa!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The fast amd the furious movies are so exciting
I know, i love them
I love when brian and mia get together
Me too they are so adorable
They are the cutest couple
And brian and dom became like best friends
They are such good movies
I know they are amazing
I wish they were going to come out with more
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where do you think they filmed Fast and the Furious?
California
It must have been hard to shoot it
Yeah. Closing down all of those streets must have been tough.
I agree. It's a complicated project.
Did you enjoy the races?
Yes
What was your favorite part?
The story Dom told about his dad.
That was sad. It told a lot about his character though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Fast and Furious character?
I really like Han myself.
Really? Why's that?
He seems to be really cool and chill. Always calm under pressure.
I see.
He also has him moments of humor, and he feels like he stands out among characters that seem more similar.
Anything else you like?
Well, he was in Tokyo Drift, which I like. I think Japan is interesting and drifting looks cool.
Yeah that wasn't too bad a movie, was it?
Nope. I liked it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, yes, Gal Gadot needs to have a resurrection or whatever they do that brings back supposedly killed off characters!
Is that right? That's going to be weird. They killed him off in Tokyo Drift, and then he came back in the Justin Lin ones since they were suppose to have occurred before Tokyo Drift.
Yeah the whole sequence is a bit confusing if you haven't been following the series the whole way through.
If I remember correctly it goes The Fast and The Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Fast and Furious, Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6, Tokyo Drift, Furious 7, The Fate of the Furious.
You got it. That's the correct chronological order.
It always throws me off since there was also that one short after the first and second one where it covers Paul Walker's trip to Miami and obtaining that Skyline.
The bonus feature, not a lot of people have seen that or know that it exist.
Yeah it's a fun extra for the fans. I'm looking forward to seeing if they do bring Han back somehow. I wouldn't be surprised.
Yeah they brought back Michelle Rodriguez' character, so I'm not surprised if Han comes back and Gal Gadot needs to come back too!
Okay, yes, Gal Gadot needs to have a resurrection or whatever they do that brings back supposedly killed off characters!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Fast & Furious movies?
I liked them, but it was really sad when Paul Walker died.
Yes it definitely was sad. I was glad they were able to complete the last film anyway.
Yes, it was a nice tribute to him to finish the movie with him CGI'd in it.
But did it seem realistic? Knowing he'd died and all?
It was somewhat unrealistic, I have to admit. You could tell where they made changes.
You definitely could see the changes. Who is your favorite actor in the series?
I love Vin Diesel! He's so good in it!
I like him, too. He's funny, serious, action packed. He can do it all.
Yes, he certainly is versatile in his acting abilities. It's a great series for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think The Fast and the Furious was very successful?
I assume it was, since they made tons of other ones.
I guess so. Part 1 had the most heart.
Every scene was unique and had good acting.
I liked the party scene. You could tell Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were gonna be good friends.
There were a lot of twists and turns in the film.
I liked when it was revealed that Paul Walker was a cop.
I was not expecting that.
I agree. It was cool though how they kept it secret for awhile.
Yes. The story was full of surprises.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the first one about? The original
The original was in 2001. It was about how the group was under investigation and the cop guy falls for the sister
Oh yeah, That Brewster chick. She's hot.
MIa Torretto. That's funny how Vin Diesel gets an italian name. He's black
But he could pass for an Italian.
I guess that's the entire point. Diesel made a movie about himself and his multiracial background. That's how he was discovered initially by Spielberg.
Going from Saving Private Ryan to Fast and Furious. That's a huge change.
I love that car though.
1970 Dodge charger.
I was like so sad when that car was totaled. That's just wrong man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
A lot of people I know are big fans of the Fast & Furious series.
I am not one of those people.
Are you serious? I really thought that everyone liked those.
I'm dead serious. I can't stand those films.
Oh, come on! What's so bad about them?
They literally took street racing to global warfare. It's just plain dumb if you ask me.
But it's super fun to watch.
Well, I've never found them fun. Just annoying.
They at least have a stacked cast, though.
I can agree with that much, sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who plays Dom's love interest in the first Fast and the Furious movie?
Michelle Rodriguez
Does she do a good job?
Yes
Is she in a lot of the films?
Yes
What is her character like?
She is a tough girl
Does she do a good job with it?
Yes. She is very good in that role.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Fast Five for the first time last night.
What did you think of it?
I actually quite enjoyed it, I had never seen past the third one.
Did you watch the fourth as well?
No, I heard it gets better around the fifth.
Yea, the franchise turns into an action movie instead of mainly about racing.
Yea, that is exactly how I felt.
The sixth one is a lot like that too.
That was pretty smart of them to spin off the genre.
Yea, the movies have been getting pretty good compared to the originals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about Fast & Furious?
Well, I think it's fast and furious
haha, you're funny, but it's kinda true, the movie series has been fast and furious
indeed. All the car fans must be having an orgasm when watching the movies
I don't consider myself a car fan, but I'm visually stunned by those crazy effects
you remember the one where Paul Walker driving across a lifted draw bridge?
oh yeah, I remembe that one so vividly even today, I was watching that scene on my TV
me too, it's sad to see Paul Walker away, now we won't be able to see him again
at least now he rests in heaven now, God bless him
God bless him
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did the first Fast and Furious movie come out?
In 2001
Wow, it has been around for a long time.
Yes, it has. It is a very lucrative franchise.
Is The Rock in part 1?
No, that one is just Paul Walker and Vin Diesel.
Who directed part 1?
Rob Cohen
Is part 1 the best?
By far.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hope they make more Fast and Furious movies.
I'm not sure if they can.
Why not?
They're already done a lot and Paul Walker won't be in them
That is true.
Paul Walker makes the franchise.
Maybe they can replace him?
No way
Each movie is really good though.
Yes. The only one I did not like was the second one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Fast and Furious Movies?
Yea, it is my favorite series of movies.
I really like Vin Diesel in the movies. Who is your favorite character?
Paul Walker.
Yea. I really like him too.
It is such a shame he passed away during filming.
I was so sad to hear that he passed.
Me too. I know people that cried.
I though it was really cool that they let his brother film after he passed.
I didn't know the did that. That is really awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the fast and the furious?
Yes i love those movies
I do too
They are so exciting and well made
And vin diesel is hot
He is really hot
I love watching him in them
He looks so good
And hes really manly
Yes he is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Paul Walker the main guy in The Fast and the Furious?
Yes and Vin Diesel is the other main guy.
Is there only one movie?
No. There is quite a few.
Are the same people in them all?
Mostly, but they add new characters. The Rock is one of the new guys they put in it.
Was part 2 good?
It was decent.
Did the same guy direct them all?
No. The first one was Rob Cohen and Mel City
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm not sure which ones I have.
Which ones of... in the series?
Yeah. I know I have the first 5 I think.
Furious 5 is the first film where Rock plays the DSS agent
Yeah, that's why I remember I have it.
i don't even remember what happens in 6 and 7...
In 6 the crew's scattered. And Letty suffers from amnesia, and Dom's sister Mia gets kidnapped, but gets rescued. And Dom drives out of the exploding plane. That's so lame.
Oh Yeah, yeah. Then the 7 is about Letty regaining her memories. And the English guy's brother goes all crazy for vengeance.
yep. Then they go to Abu Dhabi of all places. Then they tried to steal this computer program called God's eye
Oh yeah and they do that air drop thing into some place in Europe. And in the end Letty regains her memories.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Just saw Tokyo Drift, it sucked without Vin Diesel.
Doesn't he do a cameo at the end.
Drifting seems so lame compared to racing
I do love American muscle cars.
I love how he kicks in the nitro at just the right moment.
He's unbeatable.
That Dodge Charger makes me drool.
I wonder if they have more than one to make the movie.
I really like the sister character.
She's cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is there anything about the Fast & Furious series that you particularly like?
That would definitely be the action.
I knew it! Which one do you think had the best action scenes?
That's definitely Furious 7.
Some of those scenes were ridiculous!
I know! Driving sports cars through buildings in Dubai? That's just nuts!
But you have to admit, it makes for great fun.
Of course. That's why I liked it as much as I did.
I also liked how in the first few minutes, Luke literally gives a Rock Bottom to one of the bad guys.
You know, sometimes I forget that Dwayne Johnson was ever a wrestler.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Today I am going to watch fast & furious movie.
Oh very good. All fast & furious movies are my favorite.
Many times I have seen all the fast & furious movies.
Which fast & furious movie you are going to watch today?
Fast & furious 7. This is the 5th time I am going to watch.
In that movie, all the actors have done their job very well.
Exactly. When I was watching that movie I was too serious.
Which character do you like the most?
Letty the girl, who is more beautiful in this movie and acted very well.
Overall the movie is just awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Fast & Furious movies?
Yeah, I saw the most recent one that came out in the theaters.
What is that one called?
The Fate of the Furious.
Was it any good?
Yeah, it was awesome.
Wasn't The Rock in that one?
The Rock and also Charlize Theron.
I've only seen the first one.
I've seen all of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Have you seen the fast and furious movies?
Yeah I've seen a few.
Have a favorite?
I like the 4th one.
That the one with the cartel?
Yeah.
That one was pretty good.
I enjoyed it the most.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know which character I feel was underused in 'Fate of the Furious?'
Which character?
Ramsey.
She was the character portrayed by Nathalie Emmanuel from 'Game of Thrones' right?
Yea that's her.  She barely did anything in the last movie.
I did notice that too.  She was almost just there for Tyrese and Tej to fight over.
Also, the fact that she is a super hacker is almost redundant.
Yea.  I mean why does the group need another hacker when Tej has already been doing everything else for them?
I understood Ramsey's role in Furious 7, but they sort of shoehorned her in.
I hope they utilize her character more in the next movie, as she is a phenomenal actress.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Fast and Furious movies?
Nope. I've only seen like the first two and then the 6th one.
Yea, it's pretty ridiculous that they can make so many movies from that one franchise.
I don't get it. I mean I liked the first one alright, but I feel like the other movies would just kind of all be the same storyline.
How'd you like the 6th one?
Well first off, I only watched it because it was playing on the airplane I was on.
Haha, so you were basically forced to watch it?
I guess you could say that. I mean the movie was alright, it was pretty ridiculous at times and I didn't really know/remember half of the characters since it had been so long since I last saw a Fast and Furious movie.
Well maybe you should watch the other ones then. Haha.
Yea, no thanks. I mean I know of people who really enjoy them, but personally not really my cup of tea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
What was the last fast and furious movie that you saw?
Tokyo Drift was on tv there other day.
Is  that the third one?
Yeah that's right.
Do you like that one?
Not a lot, but it just happened to be on tv.
Yeah I don't really like that one.
It's kind of whatever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about the fast and the furious movies
That sounds good
I love those movies
Me too
Theres so much drama and action and adventure
They really do have it all
Its so sad they probably arent going to make anymore
I know
They were the best
Yes there were
XXXXXXXXXXX
I dont remember which one is my favorite, but i love the one with safe
Where they switched the safes at the end of the movie?
Yes that one
That was fast five
Oh okay well fast five is my favorite then
I liked that one too
Ot9 was really cool how it was done
Yes it was the ending was such a twist
Im glad they showed how it was really done
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the Fast and Furious movies?
Oh, yeah! I love them.
Which one is your favorite?
I would say the first, but I also like Furious 7.
What's you're favorite scene?
Hard to say. One of my favorites is when they drive the semi backwards.
Oh, yeah! That's intense. Who is your favorite character?
I would say Dominic Toretto, played by Vin Diesel.
I don't mind that the series is not super realistic. I see the racing as more of a form of artistic expression in cinema.
I agree! It's a visual painting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw The Fate of the Furious.
No Paul Walker, sadly.
Otherwise the same crew - Vinny Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez.
Who directed?
F. Gary Gray.
Any new stars?
Charlize Theron is the protagonist.
I loved her in Monster.
It's nice that Dom names his son Brian.
Very good touch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Fast and Furious movie?
Fast 8, yeah it was good.
What was your favorite part?
I thought the part with him fighting people while having the baby wear headphones was funny.
Yeah that was funny, but why did he put the headphones on full blast?
I don't know.
Have you ever accidentally had the volume real loud on some headphones? It's aweful. Can't be good for a baby.
No you're right. What about the camera in the necklace? How did Dom know how to do all that?
I don't know, he's Dom. He can do anything. He grew up just a street racer, but now can take down international terrorists.
True. I guess your right. Just don't think too hard about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you see the latest one, Fate of the Furious?
Yeah, I hated Charlize Theron's character.
What about Dom, did you really think he went bad again?
No, not for a minute. I was like, he doesn't have a choice!
I don't get what Dom trusted Jason Statham's character with that though.
Yeah, didn't he kill Dom's Asian friend?
That scene in Cuba was awesome, man. When the car was about to explode?
Yeah, there was flame coming through the window and Dom was just like, "Almost there!" Haha.
The submarine! Tyrese Gibson knocking that guy out with the car door!
Yeah, for once he's not just the comedic relief. He was like, "How am I number 11 on the top ten most wanted list?"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Did you see the last fast and the furious movie?
What was it called?
Furious 7.
Yeah I did see that one.
The whole movie felt a bit sad though.
Why is that?
Paul Walker's death.
Oh yeah, they had that nice tribute to him at the end of the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You've seen Fast & Furious movies right?
Yes, it's some of my favorite movies.
Do you remember when Roman Pierce was in a demolition derby?
Yes I do, why?
Well I was talking to a friend and wanted to settle something.
Alright, well ask away.
Did he bring his trailer to the derby and wasn't he also on house arrest?
Yes and yes, that's why he had to bring his home with him so he could race.
That's what I told my friend but he thought I was wrong.
Well your friend is wrong then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite movie series?
Definitely the fast and the furious
Thats mine too
Vin diesel and paul walker are awesome together
They do make a great team
I love watching their chemistry
Plus they are both great actors
And they are both so perfect for the movies
Exactly it seems like those movies were made for them
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think The Rock is good for the Fast and Furious franchise?
I do not think he fits
Why is that?
Because he tried to take the spotlight from Dom
True
He is better fit for comedy roles
Yeah, Fast and Furious is too hardcore for him.
Did you watch the original recently?
Yes. I love it
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember seeing the latest fast and the furious movie?
I do, remember I went with you and my dad?
Yeah I do.  What was your favorite part in it?
It was when Vin Diesel turns bad and joins the enemy.
What is that part your favorite?
It's my favorite because I love Vin plus I never saw the turn coming.
Me either. I am glad they are making more of the movies to hopefully explain his actions.
Me to.  The way they drive the cars around with the stunts makes it a great movie to see.
I agree.  I love the black muscle car the Vin's character drives around.
I love the green honda.  It is little but packs a punch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Have you seen all of the fast and furious movies?
No I haven't seen them all I don't think.
Do you have a least favorite movie?
Well the second one was pretty bad.
That's the one with Ludacris?
Yeah that's right.  It was pretty bad.
I don't know if I saw that one.
I wouldn't bother.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Fast & Furious movie yet?
That's the one where Dom switches sides right?
Yeah. I positively loved it.
I haven't really got to see it just yet.
Oh man you are missing out.
I know. The trailer look amazing.
You need to come over and watch it.
Dude I am up for that. I want to see what happens with that sub
You're going to love it. I really miss Brian though.
Totally. It was a big lose to them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Furious 7 again last night.
I can't believe that is the last we will see of Paul.
Yea, it was really unfortunate.
The movie paid tribute to him pretty well.
Yea, that end scene had me tearing up a little bit.
It was done really well and tastefully.
Yea, he will always be missed.
The movie itself was pretty good too.
Yea, I liked how it took place after the third movie.
It is nice how they were able to tie everything back together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whos is your favorite Fast and Furious character?
I like Dom
Same here. Did you like Paul Walker's character too?
Yes, he was cool.
Which movie did you like the most?
The first one
Yeah, me too.
I think the second one got too big.
Yeah, the first one was more about street racing and cars.
It was. I loved the drag race.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like fast and furious?
Yea, I mean, they aren't great movies but they sure are fun!
Which one is your favorite?
Definitely Tokyo Drift.
Me too, Han was awesome in that.
Yea, too bad they killed him off.
Yea, but he still came back on the next movie.
Yea, since it was about the past.
Did you know wonder woman played his girlfriend?
Yea, he's lucky!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you thing the Rock and Vin love eachother?
Like, more than Vin loved Paul?
Yeah man!
Really?
Heck yeah! You know they both love fast cars and pumping iron.
That's true.
When they're not busying stealing cars and getting into trouble, they probably like to camp and stuff.
Like camp at the beach or something?
Sure, beach, mountains, jail cell...
ha ha ha
XXXXXXXXXXX
which fast and furious movie was your favorite?
hmm, thats a really hard choice.
come on tell me already!
all the ones with dom?
oh wow, you love him that much?
he is a great character and leads his team well!.
i agree
he also takes really good care of letty.
well they are lovers!
they make a great couple.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen entire fast and furious series?
Oh yes! I just love that series!
Great. So tell me do you like brian's character?
Yes, he is good.
Okay. So do you like him more as a cop or as a street racer?
That's a tough question.
Still, you can pick one.
I think I like him more as street racer. It's more cool I think.
I agree. Being cop is boring.
Not always, but in this case I like him more as street racer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the next Fast & Furious movie will be about?
I didn't realize there were going to be more.
There are.  Number nine and ten are already planned.
It is tough to say.  How are they going to top the flying car landing from Seven, or the submarine from Eight?
To be honest, it seems like the logical progression would be something in space.
As absurd as it sounds, I would not put it past this franchise.
Especially because no matter how outlandish it seems to get, they keep making money.
Do you know how much they made with 'Fate of the Furious?'
I believe it grossed $1.23 billion.
In other words, they will keep raising the stakes for the main characters because there is such a high demand for these movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There is something I don't fully understand about 'The Fate of the Furious.'
What would that be?
Why did Charlize Theron's character need Dominic Toretto for her plan?
I have no idea.
If you think about it, Dom's only skill is driving.  What use did a super hacker have of a driver?
Dom is also a good fighter, and is the only one who could stop his crew.
But if Charlize's character didn't recruit Dom in the first place, the crew never would have intervened.
Oh, and then her plan would not have been ruined.  I think you're onto something.
I'm glad I could get that off my chest.  The rest of the movie, after accepting that premise, was really fun.
The action sequences were so well shot, and the set-pieces were executed flawlessly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i got an opinion some people give me flack for
What is that?
Well i got complained to and beraded for saying this
What was it you said
That the fast and furious movies should have only been a trilogy
That is not that bad of  a thing
every movie after the third has been nothing but hot garbage to be honest
Well i liked a few of them
What did you like about them
I liked the way it was simple fun
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Fast and Furious movie has to be number 6.
That one is my least favorite.
Really? It's one of the better ones in my opinion.
There's a slightly personal reason as to why I don't like it.
Go on.
I saw less than half of it when my family went to watch it in the theaters.
Why so little?
Because I ate something beforehand that upset my stomach badly.
So you spent more than half of the movie in the bathroom?
Unfortunately, that's how it went.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite movie is the fast and the furious 6
That was was pretty good
Yea inloved that one the most
Is so hard to pick for me
It is a hard choice
They are all really good
They are, the whole series was amazing
I havent seen the newest one yet
Me either
I wonder if its good
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the series going up to 10 movies?
What are you talking about?
Oh, I'm sorry. The Fast & Furious series.
Oh, that one. I honestly think that's just silly.
I thought the same. To think the tag line for Furious 7 was "One last ride."
Right? At this rate, there's going to be 3 extra last rides.
For number 8, "Just one more ride."
For number 9, "Seriously, this is the last ride."
For number 10, "Someone please stop this last ride."
I haven't laughed this hard in years!
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you think jason statham was a good decision to include in fast and furious series?
I think it was totally worth it. He is awesome, I am huge fan of him.
I am a bit skeptical about him, I don't know whether it's him or it's the role they assigned him.
Why, what's wrong with him or his role?
I feel that somehow he is misfit for fast and furious series.
Really? Why do you feel so? Any particular reason?
I mean they have portrayed him as this invincible guy who can do anything.
I think almost everyone in fast and furious series is portrayed that way.
Well, Not everyone, Maybe yes, But his character is way too off the ground.
I think it is more subjective matter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Fast & Furious movie franchise should continue making movies?
No.  I definitely think this series is beyond played out and should cease immediately.
Is there anything you enjoy about the Fast & Furious movies?
There were some elements of the very first movie that I did enjoy, yes.  Mostly the fact that it was new and somewhat exciting.
What is it that you don't like about Fast & Furious?
I really don't like the selection of actors.  Specifically, I'm annoyed by Michelle Rodriguez.
What about Vin Diesel?  Do you enjoy his acting in Fast & Furious?
In Fast & Furious, no.  But, I do enjoy him in other movies like Saving Private Ryan.
Do you think there will be more Fast & Furious movies in the future?
Almost definitely, yes.  I think the fan base of this franchise has very low standards and probably wants more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So does  the new movie  hold up  in the  fast  and  furious  series ?
It is ok  but  I  think  its  off  character  for  some  of  the  guys.
And when is  the  kids  from  tokyo   drift  supposed to  show  up?
I  thought  after  Brian  and Han  left .
And  now most of the bad  guys are  good  guys?
I found parts of  stathams role  to  be funny  though .
I  did like when he  saved the baby.
I   think  he is  the   new  star  of the  franchise  soon  to  replace   vin disel .
And what do you think of vin disel  having to  go  against his  own  team ?
I thought  they made him  look  way too  strong  .
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Fast and Furious 8, the Fate of the Furious?
Yes I did, and it was great.  Amazing.
That was good how Jason Statham got to be a good guy this time!
Yes it was, and he named his baby after Brian, the Paul Walker character.
Yeah, that was a nice touch.
I could tell he was going to do it when his ex-girlfriend told him she only named his middle name so Dom could give the first name.
I think I had an inkling too.
Then at the end they were having the barbecue and I knew what he was going to say..."Brian!"
Haha, yeah that was funny.
He always brings that "family" thing into everything, that's what makes it a big hit in addition to all that action!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Fast & Furious Tokyo Drift?
Yes I do.
What is your favorite part?
I like the part where they race through the housing construction.
I like that part as well.  Probably not my favorite though.
What is your favorite?
Mine is when they are drifting in the parking ramp.
That is a really great part as well.
I need to watch that movie again sometime soon.
Me as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite car in the fast and furious movies?
That's an easy one Dom's car at the end of the first movie.
Do you remember how fast it was?
It's under 10 seconds I think 9 seconds to be exact.
Wasn't it a 1970 Dodge Charger?
Yes, I believe so.
Why is that your favorite?
I love the body style and it's black which is my favorite color.
Those are good reasons, do you like that the motor sticks out from the hood?
I do it give sit character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Fast and Furious movies?
Yes.  Theyre great.
What is your favorite?
I think Tokyo Drift.
Oh yeah. the cars are amazing
I love the japanese culture.
It was cool.  The drifting was crazy.
I would have crashed.
I want to learn.
Lets watch it later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about the fast and the furious
I love those movies
Me too, i wish i had cars like that
Same here
Its wierd how brian oconnor started out a cop
But then he was legit running from the cops
Yea he completely switched sides
It made it more interesting
Yes it did
Theyre great movies
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen fas and furious seven?
yes, i have, it was very intense!
i cant believe dom went against his team!
don't forget. he had his son he needed to protect!
that is true, he wanted to protect his son.
letty was not happy though.
yea, especially when that woman kissed him in fromt of her!
that made me so mad when she did that!
me to, well i was glad when he saved his son.
me too now letty and dom have a real family!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think fast and furious movies are becoming repetitive?
Well, I certainly do feel that to a certain extent.
I mean I can say for sure that last three movies have almost same story.
I think what you are forgetting is in action movies, story is almost always the same.
Well, I agree to it only partially.
Why only partially?
I mean there has been action movies which had unique and solid story.
I think the first fast and furious was one of it.
Yes, because there were no fast and furious before part one, Obviously.
I think that is the common issue with movie series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Fast and Furious 7?
Yes! I saw it in the theatre. It was one of their best yet!
I know. I can't believe that Paul Walker's brother finished his character out for him.
Yea I know, I could barely tell which brother was playing Brian.
I loved the last scene where they sort of did an homage to Paul.
Do you mean where Dom went to race him one last time?
Yea and then they showed a video montage of Paul Walker and Brian.
It had me crying! It was so sad.
Oh me too, I am going to miss that character in the movies. He was so great.
I agree it is very sad to see him go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm really impressed that the Fast & Furious movies are able to get such great actors to join the franchise.
Yeah, they really stepped it up ever since The Rock joined.
He was the first one to bring that kind of outside star power into the franchise.
'Fast Five' was probably my favorite one, and it had everything to do with The Rock.
It's unbelievable that now, they have actors like Charlize Theron playing the main villain.
Yeah. I mean she's won an Oscar before.
Also, Kurt Russell as Mr. Nobody.
I loved him in that role.
I suppose if they can get Helen Mirren, they can get anyone.
That's right, I almost forgot about her!  I can't wait to see who they bring into the franchise next.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, the Fast & Furious films have really come a long way.
I'm not too familiar with those movies, I'm afraid. Help me out.
I got you. So, to keep it short, it basically went from simple street racing to becoming global vehicle warfare.
That sounds insane.
And it's just as insane as it sounds.
I imagine it's been quite the journey for you.
It has. I just can't wait for what's in store.
I might have to binge watch those movies just to see for myself.
I have the entire collection on Blu-ray. I can lend them to you if you want.
That sounds like a good idea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
Have you seen a fast and furious movie?
Yeah I think I've seen them all except for the newest one that is out now.
What was your least favorite one.
Tokyo Drift was pretty bad.
Was that the one without all the main characters?
Yeah.  Also had lil' bow wow.
oh man.
yeah pretty bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man I wonder something
Sure what do you wonder
I wonder if Vin diesel can actually drive like he does in the movies
Well i am sure he has to perform some of his stunts
I am not really talking about the stunts
What are you talking about
Just the driving in general
Well it would be possible
I guess
I mean i am sure its not fake
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi there.
Do you think this will be the last fast and the furious movie?
What number are they up to now?
8.
oh wow.
Yeah quite a bit.
Then no, I don't think they will stop making them.
I thought they might after Paul Walker's death.
Yeah I forgot about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like fast and furious 1?
I liked it a lot.
Yea, I feel its the best of the franchise
The newer movies have too much action.
The newer ones have a very different feel to the first few films.
Yea, but the actors pull it off very well.
I do miss Paul Walker.
He was a very good reason for why the franchise worked.
The cars really make the movies excitiing.
I like Vin diesels car in the 1st movie the best
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was one better than two?
Was that the one with the boat or race?
The boat was two and the physics were impossible but thats 2 fast 2 furious.
I prefer the original.
Well than did you like the mexican race one?
Is that 4 or 5?
I believe it is 4
There is many films its hard to keep track
Its all about the cars.
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Fast Five.
Who directed it?
Justin Lin.
Any new actors?
Dwayne Johnson plays a cop.
Wow, the Rock.  What happens?
Diesel and Walker steal $100M from a drug lord.
They seem to steal from drug lords a lot.
Yes, they do.  Johnson lets the pair go off.
Very predictable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you really like the "Fast and Furious" movies don't you?
Oh, yeah, for sure! They are some of favorite movies! Did you see "The Fate of the Furious" yet?
No, not yet, but I thought I would ask you about it. Did you like it?
Oh yeah, it was awesome! I really like it when the movies kind of take Dom and the team all across the globe; it really gives the stories an "epic adventure" kind of feel.
Cool! Where did they go in this one?
Well, I don't want to spoil too much, but they go pretty much everywhere in this one, including Cuba, Russia, and New York.
Wow, that's pretty awesome. I am guessing there are some crazy chase scenes like always too, right?
Oh yeah! There is a crazy scene involving a submarine in Russia that will totally blow your mind!
Wow! I really have to see it! Just when you think Dom has done it all, it pulls off some even crazier stunt!
For sure! This one even tops Furious 7, and that is really saying something!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember that race in 2 fast 2 furious?
Which one?
The bridge jump race.
Oh yes of course I remember.
That has to be my favorite street race in the franchise.
Yes it was an incredible race and exciting.
Do you remember who won that race?
Brian of course, how can you not remember that?
I sometimes forget, wasn't he driving the silver and blue car in that one?
Yes he was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the fast and furious movies
Me too
I love that ludacris stars in them
Same here, hes great
I didnt realize he was a good actor too
Me either, he is very talented
I agree with that
These movies are made for him
Yes he is perfect in them
He really is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Fast & Furious 6?
Yeah I did mostly because The Rock was in it.
Isn't his real name Dwayne Johnson?
Yes it is, he also used to wrestle in the WWE.
Neat, do you remember the scene where they are having a cook out and The Rock walks up?
Yes and Roman tells the girl she better hide her baby oil.
Then The Rock said you better hide that big forehead.
That was a really funny part.
Did you know that part was improvised?
No I didn't that's awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many of The Fast and the Furious movies have you seen?
All of them.
What do you think of The Rock's character.
i really like him, I think he brought a much needed outside element to the movie.
How so?
Well they already had big name stars, but they didnt really have that cop presence since Brian became part of the team.
I see, so you think he legitimized it a little?
I do. I think he added credibility to a franchise quickly losing it.
I think you'e right, he fights well too.
Yea, i liked how they incorporated some of his WWE stuff in there too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Fast and the Furious did you think had the best car chases or races?
I think the original The Fast and The Furious had the best. It was actually a racing movie with a heist background.
That's true, the original had I think three actual races. The first street race at night, the desert race battles, and then there was that race with the Ferrari guy.
That guy had one of the best lines in the series, "More than you can afford pal, Ferrari."
Then Dom tells Brian to smoke him in that legendary orange Toyota Supra.
If you go back to watch the original The Fast and The Furious, you'd be surprise at how many great one liners you'll be able to recite.
Nobody comes here for the tuna! I kind of miss those early characters, Vince and Jesse.
Well Vince made a return and redeemed himself later in the series which was cool, but Jesse died! He got shot up at the end remember?
That's right how could I forget about Jesse's unfortunate murder.
They need to keep the core characters that are there now, people need Dom obviously, but now you can't take away the Rock from us.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the first two Fast & Furious movies the best.
I liked them all pretty much.
Did you like Paul Walker?
Yes for sure.
It was a shame when he died him and Vin Diesel together made those movies.
I know and to die in a car.
His brother stepped in for one of the movies.
Did you see that one.
Yes I did.
I think they did a good job with what they had to work with.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you gonna see the new Fast and Furious movie?
What number is this again? Seveteen? Fifty-six?
Seven, I think.
Ha! You're a fan and you don't even know.
I don't care what number it is. They're good movies. Except for maybe Tokyo Drift.
I'm surprised you even wanna see this new movie. That Paul guy isn't in it.
Hey! It's getting really good reviews. I'll give it a chance. So you wanna go with me?
uh.. I"ll think about it.
I have this feeling that if you see this one, you'll become a fan. Have you seen any of them?
I saw the first one. It was okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Tokyo Drift.
For some reason that movie sticks out in my head the most of the franchise.
In a good or bad way?
Bad, it was really cheesy and had none of the main characters.
Yea, neither Paul nor Vin were in it as main characters.
Also the music and cars were silly.
Yea, they really went crazy with the cars.
Maybe they thought since they were in Japan they needed to up the strange factor.
Yea, most seemed like toys that would never be driving on a road.
Yea, that black and orange one in particular.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was that street race intense in part 1?
You mean the one where Paul Walker lost his car?
Yes.
I loved that scene. I thought for sure he would win.
The first Fast and the Furious was so good.
Yeah, especially that scene.
When his laptop told him the car was in danger, I knew he was not going to win.
I agree.
Vin Diesel was definitely gonna win that race from the start.
It was fun to watch though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the first Fast and Furious movie?
I thought it was cool. I got really into cars after it.
Me too. What was your favorite part?
The first race scene where Paul Walker's car breaks on him.
Yeah that was really cool.
I loved his car too. It looked really cool.
Did you like Vin Diesel?
Yes, he was really cool in this.
Was there anything you did not like?
No, I thought the whole movie was cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What the hell happened to the Fast and Furious movie series?
What are you talking about?
It use to be about cool cars and racing.
It's still about that.
No, now they are on some Oceans 11 bank robbery stuff.
Yeah, I can see why you think that.
What do you think was the worst one?
Easy, that's Tokyo Drift.
Is that the one with Lil Bow Wow?
That's the one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the first Fast & Furious movie because I loved that classic car.
Yes that is awesome.
Dom was afraid to drive it but did that car was pretty fast.
Yes I wish I could drive that car.
You like Vin Diesel?
Yes he is pretty cool.
You don't see many actors that are in most of the series of movies.
No and he is in the new one. The Rock is also in the new one.
I like The Rock too.
I used to watch him back when he wrestled I guess that was the 90's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really miss Brian's character.
Me too.  Paul Walker was so great in his role.
Did you notice that they tried to replace him in the latest Furious movie?
How so?
They introduced Scott Eastwood's character as another Brian.  A law man who goes rogue.
Now that you mention it, he even drove a similar blue car as Brian.
Exactly.  I understand why they would try to do it, but I don't think it was executed correctly.
Indeed.  His character had a few lines but played no major role.
There was a period of maybe 20 minutes or so where he just wasn't on screen.
Maybe they will better utilize his character in Fast 9.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have. u seen the last fast and furious movie?
No i havent seen the last two
Why not?
I havent been able to since paul walker died
Thats true i can see that
Its so sad and he was the movie
Yea he kind of was
Dont get me wrong vin disel was too
But they were a great pair
Yes they were
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you like Fast and the Furious?
Yeah I guess so.
Any one that stands out as the worst?
The second one or third one is pretty bad.
I didn't like the one where they are in japan.
That was 3 I think.
Yeah that one was pretty bad.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Fast and Furious movies?
Yes, I have seen all of them. Sad to see Paul Walker Die
Yeah, it sure was a tragedy
Do you have a favorite movie?  Mine was the last one "Fate of the Furious?
Not really, I am not a huge fan of the movies.  I watch them, but only once they come to DVD
What don't you like about them?
Well, I love the Rock so I'm glad they added him, but the stories are lame as hell.
Really, I think they are cool.  I love the action in the movies and the car scenes are great.
I guess if your a car guy you could.  I'm not and the chase scenes are ridiculously fake
Aww, come on man.  They are just fun to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How awesome was it when the cars were dropped out of the plane in Furious7?
That was incredible, Rome was the best part though.
Yeah when he was freaking out at the edge of the bay door telling them how he couldn't do it.
Then Tej hits the button for his chute.
It was great hearing him scream the whole way down.
Then he ended up in that tree, I couldn't help but laugh.
How cool would that be to do though?
It would be so much fun, but I'd want to go out face first.
Why would you want to do that?
Cause then I could floor it off the plane and it would force me into a barrel roll. I just think it'd be even more fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite Fast & Furious character
for sure it's Dom.
Really? I always like Hobbs better.
no way. Dom is the best!
Hobbs is so much bigger and stronger though.
yeah, but Hobbs wasn't even one of the original characters.
True, but he steals the show in the later sequels
There wouldn't even be a movie without Dom, he's the center of almost all the movies
yeah, except for 2, which he was barely in.
that one was the worst
XXXXXXXXXXX
That Camaro was sweet too.
Yep, 1969 Yenko Camaro.
427 cubic inches of solid american steel. 425 horses.
I think I prefer a 60s camaro over a mustang from the same time any day.
Well they haven't used a Shelby in any of their movies.
Oh Yeah Shelby GT is the best Mustang of them all.
Shelby Cobra GT 500. That's the car that needs to be in the movie.
That will be so rad. 1969 Shelby GT 500. Now that is the quintessential American muscle car
That's an icon of its day. Big bad, and beautiful. 428 cubic inches of American power.
7 liters of gasoline burning inside that engine. That's a lot of power.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite fast and furious character?
My favorite character is Dom. Specifically in the fate of the furious.
Is that the movie, where Dom turns against his entire family?
He doesn't turn against his family, he finds out he has a new member of his family who is being threatened and has to protect him.
Does he protect his new member of the family?
He does by pretending to be a bad guy and his wife is the only person who believes is still good.
Dom is always doing the right thing even if you can't see it at the time.
Yes he does, he always puts him family first, now matter what.
Was their any other parts that you liked in the movie?
They had to drive on ice, and have to take down a submarine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man what was your favorite Fast & Furious and why?
I'd have to say it was Fast 5.
Really? How come?
I liked the introduction of Dwayne Johnson's character. It really felt like he was a threat to the group.
Yeah his character was pretty aweosme. He did a great job on it.
In addition to that I really liked they way they paid respects to Paul Walker and his character. It was a real tear jerker in the theaters.
Yeah. I agree. It wasn't my favorite of the series but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't good.
What was your favorite?
I'd say Fast 7 was mine because of Jason Statham's character.
Nice choice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Would you consider yourself a fan of fast and the furious?
Yeah I would say so, but not a huge fan or anything.
Yeah I would say the same about myself.
Do you have a favorite movie?
I liked the first one the best.
I saw the first one on the other day and it took me back.
Yeah reminds me of where I was when that came out.
Hard to believe they're still making them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Fast and Furious movies?
Are you kidding? They are awesome!!
They really are! I loved the first two so much.
Me too. I like the newer ones even more, though.
Really? I like them, but not nearly as much.
Fast Five was just so awesome.
It kind of turned the franchise into a heist series, though.
Yeah, but I love heist films!
Me too, but it just wasn't what I expected from them.
Well I am glad they did it! They got even better with time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love how the rock got involved with these movies
Me too
The fast and furious has vin diesel and the rock
What more could a movie have
I dont think anything
These movies are perfect
I wish paul walker was still around though
Me too
That would be better
Yes it would
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Fast & Furious 6 before?
Which one is that?
It has all the main cast along with Luke Evans.
I may have seen it, does Evans play the villain?
Yea, he is Luke Hobbs and the crew get hired to take him down.
Is The Rock in this one?
Yea, he is the agent who offers them a deal if they help.
Yea, I remember that one, it was a fun watch.
Yea, one of my favorites of the series.
Yea, it is one of my favorites too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what's your favorite Fast & Furious movie?
I have to give that to Furious 7.
Same here. What's your reason?
For me, it holds a special place in my heart because it was the sendoff film for Brian.
Was he your favorite character?
Yes, ever since the first one.
It was a really touching sendoff to see him go off and be a father.
Yeah. I'm tearing up just thinking about it.
Man, you're gonna make me cry by saying that!
I'm not crying, you're crying!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want o have a family movie night this weekend
Oh great idea, what kind of movie?
I am not sure, I am thinking something fast paced and exciting
How about  fast and furious?
Oh yeah, I bet the kids would love that
The cars are really amazing, and I love Vin deisel
I loved Paul Walker, I was sad to hear he died
I agree, such a waste, he was a really good actor
Want to join us for movie night?
I would love that, thanks
XXXXXXXXXXX
Morning.
Hello.
Do you plan on seeing the new fast and furious?
I don't know.  Maybe if I'm bored one day.
I know what you mean.
Are you going to see it?
Yeah I think I might.
Well it does look like a good popcorn movie.
Yeah that's what I'm thinking.
exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Fast and Furious character?
Hobbs, without a doubt.
Hobbs is played by Ludacris?
No, Agent Hobbs, played by the Rock.  Who is your favorite?
Either Han or his girlfriend.
Yeah, she died to save him.
I cried so hard when both of them died.  I didn't know why they had to kill them off.
I can't wait to watch the new one
I wonder how they're going to deal with the Paul Walker situation.
But they already did.  In the last one he retired with the girl and his kid, that was the send.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Brian in the Fast and Furious movies?
Yes I love him.
Do you think he's that awesome in real life?
I hope so, he's so dreamy.
Do you have a crush on him?
Obviously I do.
What do you like about him as an actor?
Well first off he's all business but at the same time he's not. He will do what it takes to get the job done but for the right reasons.
That's a good reason.
Plus he's just awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Fast & Furious?
Which one, haven't there been a lot?
Fast & Furious is the fourth one.
It was just called Fast & Furious?
Strange name but that is correct.
Then what was the first one called?
The Fast and the Furious.
So they just took 2 words for part 4?
Yea, seems quite lazy or they ran out of ideas.
Yea, and no I have not seen it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So did you see fate of furious?
Oh yes! What a great movie!
Indeed! it was absolutely awesome!
The thing with fast and furious series that it gets better with each movie.
I absolutely agree.
I mean what a movie!
I just loved the stunts. It just blew my mind!
So do you think there will be another fast and furious movie?
It's hard to say, because the title of last movie seems it's the end of series.
I wish they continue with the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the latest Fast and Furious movie?
I only saw the first movie.  I hated it.
I think that they should have stopped with the third movie.
I think they should have not made the first one. Vin Diesel has no acting talent.
I agree. Vin Diesel has muscles and that's it.
Paul Walker was decent though.
I thought Paul Walker was good as well.
The cars in those movies were not that impressive to me.
I can think of a better way to waste 90 minutes.
Waste is right. Those movies were so boring.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what really upset me about Fast & Furious 6?
What disappointed you?
I feel like the characters totally forgot about Gisele at the end.
Wow.  Now that you mention it, they totally glossed over that.
One of their crew members died, but they seemed so happy about celebrating when they got Mia back.
That was very uncharacteristic of the crew to forget a family member.
They should have at least had a moment of silence for Gisele.  Especially since she died sacrificing herself for Han.
That made me angry as well.  By the way, you realize who the actress who portrayed Gisele was?
Yeah, it was Gal Gadot!
I guess we can't be too sad about her leaving the franchise, now that she's Wonder Woman.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any rumors yet about 'Fast 9?'
There are a few details.  For instance, Vin Diesel and The Rock are set to reprise their roles.
That's cool, but I'm actually surprised.
How so?
Didn't they not get along during the shooting of the movie?
I did hear something like that.  Apparently they had a feud but were cordial to each other on set.
I suppose as long as you can work with the person, it's fine.  What was the feud even about?
There was a rumor that it was about who would have the bigger role.  The Rock apparently conceded.
So there was a chance that 'Fate of the Furious' could have been about Hobbs, The Rock's character, going bad instead.
That would have been just as fun to watch.  And as a former cop, Hobbs would have been more interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Fate of the Furious?
I thought it was alright, it was not going to be the same without Paul.
Yea, he was such a major part of the franchise.
It just feels off without him.
The rest of the cast were pretty good though.
Yea, definitely.  Charlize Theron was great.
I did also kind of miss Brewster though.
Yea, it seems strange that they wrote her out of the series.
I wonder if she wanted out or if the writers just felt it needed to be done.
I would guess she did not want to do any more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the upcoming Fate of the Furious?
Personally I can't believe they are doing an 8th film.
I know right? I mean I'm all for a movie about cars, and racing them, but come on!
I know right? Its kind of completely lost its touch.
It's like the entire movie has forgotten the reason why the movie was put together in the first place.
Right? The movie just needs to go back to the basics, fast cars, fast women, and good times.
At least they still have most of the original characters.
Yea, my favorite is Dom, I'm really wondering what is up with him in this latest movie tho.
Yea it really looks like he's going to be a bad guy.
Yea what do you think that's all about?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Fast & Furious movie?
At this point I'd say that my favorite is Furious 7. How about you?
My definite favorite is 2 Fast 2 Furious. That movie's a classic if you ask me.
Really? I didn't think it was that good.
At first, neither did I. I've just come to appreciate it for the story details it offers.
What story details?
Since it doesn't have Dom or Letty in it, it gives us a better look at characters like Brian, Roman, and Tej.
I guess that makes sense.
Overall, though, I definitely still have a soft spot for that movie.
I can definitely respect that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen furious 7?
Yes, I think so.
Do you remember the air plane scene?
You mean the one where they drive the cars out of the plane?
That's the one.
What about it?
Do you remember Roman Pierce being terrified?
I do that was hilarious.
That had to be my favorite part of the whole franchise.
Yeah that made me laugh for awhile.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Fast & Furious 6?
Absolutely I loved it.
Do you recall the part where they're racing down the highway trying to save Letty?
I don't recall that no can you rejog my memory.
I can try, well there was a man I don't remember his name in a tank.
I do remember the tank that was crazy.
Yeah and they were trying to save letty.
I don't remember that part.
Well Dom was on one side of the highway and they were on the other and Letty got thrown from the vehicle when Dom flew through the air and caught her smashing into a car.
Oh yes now I remember.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the first Fast & Furious movie?
Yes, it is my favorite.
It is my favorite as well.
What is your favorite scene?
I love when they are robbing the trucks.
Yeah, that is pretty action packed.
I think the other movies are good but the first one is the best.
I would have to agree.
I think I have seen the movie at least ten times.
I have as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Eva Mendes in Fast 5?
No I don't remember her being in that. Wasn't she only in 2 Fast 2 Furious?
She was the lead actresses in 2 Fast 2 Furious but she made a post credit cameo in Fast 5.
Wow, I didn't realize that! What did she do?
She basically works for the Feds I think. She was handing the Rock some files.
What were in the files? I need to watch Fast 5 again.
The files she handed over to the Rock post credit was a file on Letty. Remember she supposedly died in the 4th one.
That's really interesting! I didn't realize this scene existed. It kind of makes sense now that Michelle Rodriguez's Letty just appeared in Fast and Furious 6.
I know it's one of those Fast and Furious Easter eggs! I put it right next to that scene of Paul Walker driving to Miami, and Dom driving around Mexico.
I've watched those scenes! I need to go and catch that Eva Mendes scene!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite character in the Fast & Furious series?
If I'm being honest, it's just got to be Dom.
Really? Care to explain?
I just find him to be the coolest character is all.
Cool how, though?
His tone of voice, his facial expressions, his fashion, his overall demeanor, it all just screams cool guy to me.
But is there any bigger reasons why?
I think he has a decent amount of depth to his character.
Do you mean emotionally.
Of course. He's more softhearted than most will say he is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the fast and Furious franchise is actually done?
Well, they did call the last one the fate of the eight.
I suppose so, but the franchises just seem to keep making movies even after they stop being good.
This last one was still pretty good.
It was okay, I missed Paul walker.
They did an okay job of explaining why he wasn't around.
I thought they still could have used some old footage or something as a memorial to his character.
Vin Diesel and the Rock were still pretty awesome.
There's no way that the Rock would lose a fist fight to the guy from Crank.
That's a good point, his arms are the same size as the other guy's waist!

Did you see Furious 7?
Is that the one where Paul Walker died during filming?
Yes, and they used his real life brothers Cody and Caleb as stand-ins to finish the movie for him.
I didn't know that.
Yeah, that way they could finish the movie.
So is O'Connor killed off as a character then?
No they played it as he retired.
He was so important to the franchise as he is in all the movies
Well he wasn't in Tokyo Drift or Los Bandoleros
Wow you know a lot about  Fast and Furious

Tyrese has to be my favorite character in the Fast and Furious series. He's just so funny.
Roman Pearce! He's got the best one liners. He's pretty much the comic relief of the series now.
I love how he makes light of the situations they get in and he's always the one who has to struggle through.
The last one, Fate of the Furious, he was hilarious in that.
I loved when he took the Lamborghini out to the ice and everyone looked at him like he was crazy for taking that type of car out to that environment.
That scene was wild. I loved the craziness that was the submarine they were trying to out run.
I've never seen a car chase involving a submarine before. A first for everything!
I mean it was great because it was a submarine, but that submarine was also launching torpedoes at the cars!
I'm trying to think of another scene in the series or any other movies that had something that outrageous.
I'm drawing a blank, but Fate of the Furious had a lot of over the top moments!

I saw Furious 7 last night.
I hear they got a new director.
James Wan, replacing Justin Lin.
Didn't Walker die before finishing the movie?
Yes.  They used his younger brothers as stand ins to finish.
Crazy.  What's the plot?
The bad guy from 6 (Shaw) has a brother who vows vengeance on the gang.
Is Dwayne Johnson in this?
Yes.  He had a schedule conflict with Hercules but got it straightened out.
Nice.  I read the movie had  tribute to Walker.

Yeah, I thought Han was great.

Which ones?
Los Bondoleros, Fast and Furious, Fast Five, and Fast and Furious 6
I'll have to see if I can find them.
You should, and we could watch them together
That would be fun

The new Picture Fast & Furious 8 will be coming out this summer are you going to see it?
Yes I like Fast &Furious there are a lot of great actors in their movies.
I like action movies and Fast & Furious has a lot of action in it.
Dwayne Johnson is in a few of the movies too, he is a good actor.
Yea! do you like Vin Diesel in the movies?
Yes! Vin Diesel is a real tough guy and drives a cool car.
Do you like Tyrese Gibson?he is in a of the Fast & Furious movies too.
Yes! and Fast & Furious 1,2,and 3 were great movies too.
Do you like when they have all those drag races?
Yes, Fast & Furious is a great movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Fast and Furious movies?
Yeah. I've seen most of them. I think they are getting repetitive though.
Really? I kind of like them.
It just seems that the whole premise has been lost.
What do you mean? There are cars, drugs, racing, seems all legit.
Well, after Tokyo Drift, it seems like they were just rehashing the same story over and over.
The newer ones are really different though.
I know, and I don't like it. They moved away from racing and more to trafficking.
I guess. They aren't so much just racers now. They are into more criminal acts.
Exactly. I don't really like it.
