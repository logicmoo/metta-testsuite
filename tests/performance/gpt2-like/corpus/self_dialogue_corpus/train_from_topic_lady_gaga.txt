Do you have a favorite Lady Gaga song?
I have two, my favorites are Bad Romance and Monster, what about you?
I really like the Cure.
What did you think about the release of the Cure?
I like that she released it at Coachella.  I thought that was pretty cool.
My favorite music video she did was Bad Romance,  I still think its one of the best music videos out there.
I liked that one and I also liked Alejandro, I thought it was really edgy and unique.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man I love Lady Gaga!
Me too.  There's something about her music that just makes you want to dance!
Every time I hear "Bad Romance" I can't help but sing along and dance.
I like that her music is unconventional.
Like "Born this Way?"
Yes!  I love that Lady Gaga embraces being different.
Me too.  Did you see her when she was helping coach on American Idol?
I did.  I think she's such a great role model.
I agree.  I really liked watching her in concert too. You should have seen her perform "Poker Face"
She does put on a great show!  I remember watching her on the Super Bowl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know when Lady Gaga was born?
Yep, she was born in 1986
where is she from?
I believe she is from New york city
What song do you just love that she did?
I really like Bad romance, it was so telling and one of her earlier songs Just Dance
Will you ever go see her in concert?
Absolutely, i would love to see an acoustic set
Did you see her ever as an actress?
Yes, she was on one of my favorite shows American Horror Story and she did an awesome believable job
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any new Lady Gaga music lately?
No I haven't. I did hear Bad Romance the other day.
Oh, I like that one. It makes me want to sing along.
Me too. And I did. Even though I don't know all the words.
I don't either, I just stumble along with it.
I think my favorite one is still Paparrazzi.
Yeah, was that her first one?
No I think Poker Face was.
Oh yeah Poker Face, still a good sing-a-long song, too.
I really can't think of a song of hers that I don't like.
XXXXXXXXXXX

I think she is short.
I think she is 5 foot 1 inch.
How old do you think she was when she started performing?
I think she sang in public at 14.
Have you seen her IMDb?
Yes, she has been very active.
She has 36 acting credits.
I guess she is a good actress.
She probably is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like pop music
Yes i listen to it often
Who is your favorite artist
I love lady gaga
Shes really good
She is such an empowering female
Thats definitely true
She is full of confidencr and individualality
Yes her outfits are a bit extreme though
Just a little bit
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga just released a new single.
Oh, yeah? I hadn't heard it.
It's called The Cure. It's awesome.
Is it on radio? What's it sound like?
It sounds like summertime, if that makes sense. The lyrics are really good.
Her lyrics are always great. Does she write her own lyrics?
I'm pretty sure. She's a really talented musician.
Agreed. She's also just such a cool artist.
I know. She dances, has amazing costumes, her videos are so innovative.
That's why I love her so much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga's music has been a little disappointing lately.
I like it, how do you mean disappointing?
Well, it's not that I don't like it, it's decent enough. But she used to feel more exciting and adventurous.
Yeah, I guess I can see what you mean.
She started out as kind of generic dance-pop but then quickly took the genre into some new directions, likewise with her music videos.
Yeah.
But now it seems like anyone could make the music she's making, production-wise at least. And the videos have gotten rather flat and boring too.
She had a good video for John Wayne.
That one was weird again, but I don't think I would call it good. It was missing something that her earlier ones had.
Yeah, I did sort of notice that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the last lady Gaga song that you heard?
To be honest, I heard a podcast but haven't bought an album since the fame monster!
I heard that her real name is Stephanie!
It's Stefani Joanne Angelina Germonotta. Have you heard the song Bad Romance?
Have I? Lady Gaga is one of my top favorites. I like the song Lemonade ft. Beyonce
I wonder when she will come to San Francisco, next.
I want to get some Lady Gaga apparel! Her new fan website is amazing.
Lady Gaga was born in 1986 but her clothes represent three different decades. I love lady gaga!
I will let you know when the next Lady Gaga concert is and I will give you a ring!
Okay definitely.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Are you going to get to see Lady Gaga on tour this summer?
Yes, I hate to wait until August though.
Where are you going to see her?
My boyfriend and I are going to Vegas for her August 11th show.
She's such an interesting artist. Seems like she's always changing her look.
I know, right?  Her costumes are crazy.

Probably Judas but Poker Face and Marry the Night were really good too
What song do you think I should download if I want to get introduced to her music
Definitely Bad Romance
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite album by Lady Gaga?
Oh wow. All of them are perfect but I'm going to have to say either The Fame or The Fame Monster.
Nice! So you've been a fan from day one. So have I! What are your favorite songs from each of those albums?
I like Paparazzi from The Fame and Speechless from The Fame Monster. All of the songs are awesome though. What about you?
I like Brown Eyes from The Fame and Monster from The Fame Monster. I agree, the entire albums are epic.
Cool. I'll be happy when she has a concert near here so we can go.
I agree! That would be such a treat. I'm dying to see what amazing outfit and stage setting she will come up with.
Oh right! She is very good about those things. I dont care what anyone says, her fashion is top notch.
Indeed! Oh I have another question, what is your favorite music video from her? I think the music video for G.U.Y is awesome.
I like G.U.Y too! My favorite would probably be the Eh Eh Nothing Else I Can Say video. I loved her cute hair bow hairstyle, the Italian theme and that spaghetti in the video looked so delicious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was Lady Gaga's first album called?
The Fame Monster, I thought it was her best work in her career.
I didn't really start listening to her until her album Born This Way, which is my favorite.
I thought that album was a little to dark for me I preferred her more pop sound.
Do you have some songs you could recommend from The Fame Monster, I could check out?
Sure. My favorites are PokerFace and Papparazi.
I actually think I may have heard that song PokerFace before it just slipped my mind.
I am sure you have that was one of her biggest singles.
Well when I listen to The Fame Monster maybe it will jog my memory. Thanks For the Suggestions!
You are welcome! Be sure to tell me what you think about the album
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into Lady Gaga at all?
Yes occasionally I find her alright.
I like her old stuff but not her new stuff.
Yeah her old stuff was good because it was club music mostly.
The current stuff is more boring.
I understand that.
What about the Fame Monster album?
That one was semi okay but not my favorite.
Hopefully her next album is more upbeat.
That would be awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you start liking Lady Gaga?
I actually didn't care for her for a really long time.
What made you change your mind?
My best friend is really into Lady Gaga and she wore me down.
Did you know that Lady Gaga is a really amazing musician?
Yes! That's part of what swayed me!
Why didn't you like her?
I feel like she tries too hard to be weird. But her music is actually really good.
Are you thankful to your friend for convincing you to give her another listen?
Yes, I really am!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what the video of Lady Gaga singing in the car with a british guy is called?
Of course! Thats a segment called 'Carpool Karaoke' from 'The Late Late Show With James Corden'.
Yes, thats it! Have you seen it?
Only 15 times haha. I love all the 'Carpool Karaoke' videos, but the Lady Gaga one is a top favorite of mine.
I couldn't believe how amazing Lady Gaga's voice sounded completely natural in that car!
She's incredible, pure raw talent. Her voice has so much emotion in it, I can feel her words.
I liked seeing her personality shine through once she relaxed. James Corden is hilarious too.
If you like that one, then you have to watch some of his other videos. My favorite part was when she explained part of the lyrics to Bad Romance.
Yes! When she said that "Ra-ra-ro-ma-ma is like saying romance" it finally made total sense to me.
Me too. I had never thought of it that way before, but now I wonder how I ever missed that; its so simple!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever listen to Born This Way album by lady Gaga?
I haven't, tell me about it.
It was released in 2011, and had some fantastic songs on it.
Fashion of His Love was on it right?
Yes and also Americano was listed.  That one is my favorite album.
What label did she produce it on?
It was on  Interscope Records label.
Did she win some awards for it?
She won Billboard Music Award for Top Dance/Electronic Album with that one.
I am sure it went platinum.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Tweet about Lady Gaga?
No, what was it?
A conspiracy theory about how Lady Gaga killed Lina Morgana.
What?
Look here. Read this.
That's complete bull crap! Haha!
No. It's true. Even Morgana's mom's says it's true.
You shouldn't believe everything you read on the Internet.
You shouldn't doubt everything either
Lady Gaga is not a murderer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever been to a Lady Gaga concert?
Yes, I saw here in Cleveland at the Quicken Loans arena.
Did you watch the season of American Horror Story that Lady Gaga was on?
Yes, it was really good.  She won a Golden Globe award for it.
Did you know she was named Billboard's woman of the year in 2015?
No, I didn't know that but she has her own organization called the Born This Way Foundation which is cool.
Yeah, I love that she tries to promote youth empowerment and stands up against bullying.
She's a great role model.  She has a couple drinks at Starbucks too.  I want to try them!
I saw that!  It's called the Cups of Kindness Collection!  Which drink do you want to try?
The Ombre pink drink looks really pretty but the violet drink sounds delicious!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think Gagas best album is
Hmm their is so many to choose from
Right?
Well i guess i like fame the best
Nuh uh
Yeah its the one i could pick
Well my choice is cheek to cheek
That one is good too
She has so many classics
Its hard right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga is pretty outrageous. Do you like her?
I don't think I really like her as a person. But I do like some of her songs.
I can see that.
I would never go to one of her concerts. But I sometimes sing along it her songs come on.
Yeah I don't understand her persona.
It makes me wonder if she is insecure deep down.
You mean because she doesn't show her real face?
Exactly. It's probably a way to create mystery. It's just odd
I think she also tries to make a statement about some aspects of society.
That's a good point. Maybe I don't always understand her perspective.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Paparazzi?
Yes, that is from Lady Gaga.
I like that bed room she is in.
I felt sad when she was pushed over the side.
She got paralyzed.
Her crutch dance was cool.
It was crazy that she made it look cool.
Her tiny black lips were strange.
It looked kind of like MICKEY MOUSE with the sunglasses.
Then she killed the boyfriend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's music?
Yes, most of her music is really upbeat and catchy
I really love her born this way song.
Me too.
Did you see her in the super bowl half time show?
Yes, She jumped off the top part of her stage at the end and it scared me.
She is a great performer.
I agree and she can keep up with all of those professional dancers.
Yes. She has a real talent.
I would love to see her in concert.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga?
For sure, she is so good.
What songs do you like?
Paper Gangsta and the Fame.
I haven't heard Paper Gangsta.
It sounds very catchy.
I like Monster.
That song is weird.
I also like Judas.
Judas sounds powerful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you first start listening to Lady Gaga?
I started listening when she first got popular with Poker Face.
See, I didn't catch on till The Fame Monster.
That is my absolutely favorite album of hers.
Mine too. I like how it deals with obsession and the dark side of fame.
Paparazzi is the best.
I feel like it works on a fame level, but also on a relationship level.
Yeah. She's good about writing in a way that reaches everyone.
I like that she seems really connected to her music.
I agree. It all feels really heartfelt and passionate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
lady gaga's music used to be so good
her first two albums were authentic!
the piano pieces were stellar
summer boy was the jam, you're right
her new music is just too weird. it's basically impossible to listen to
yeah, she's changed
and it's because of fame. obviously. fame monster and all
it's fitting, i guess...
i still miss her pretty piano tracks, though.
i doubt if she did one now it would even sound as good
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Do you like Lady Gaga?
Yeah I love her.
What is it about her that you love?
I love her outrageous outfits.
She does wear a lot of those.
Yes, like the meat dress.
Oh man that was so weird.
Yeah it was weird alright.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you have a favorite song by gaga?
probably born this way.
it is like a lgbt anthem to be yourself.`
I love it. it is inspiring and so great.
I love speechless.
what album is that from?
the fame monster.
The one with bad romance.
yup. go listen to it.
i think i will after this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga is so unique.
She really is!
She has a beautiful voice.
I like when she sings live and plays the piano.
Me too! Like when she sings You And I live?
Yes! How did you know that's one of my favorite?
DId you see the performance of You and I where she dressed in drag?
No way! She did?
Yeah. She had on a suit and it looked really awesome.
I want to see that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
remember when lady gaga wrote a song called paper gangsta?
oh my god. not even gangster?
nope!
oh my god wait, i remember now. it's one of her older songs, right?
yup!
she's so embarassing
she really is. she literally says stinkin' lincoln. what does that even mean?
such a terrible rhyme!
i can't believe she's that kind of white person.
honestly? i can.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is lady gaga's real name?
Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta that is full and middle names.
That is a mouthful. I like her a lot.
ya me too. She is such a talented girl.
No kidding. she is one of the few truly talented singers in my book.
Ya she is one performer who does not disappoint live.
She is so good live and the fact that she also plays piano I find mind blowing.
Apparently she had studied at Tisch School of the Arts.
I believe she dropped out to pursue her music full time.
Interesting I wonder how long she had been there studying, pretty prestigious school,
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just recently started to get into Lady Gaga's music.
She has a lot of really good music.
I think her videos are really different.
Paparazzi is pretty weird.
Not one for kids to see.
I really like Poker Face is good and she looks really good in the video.
I think one of her strangest songs is Born This Way. have you seen the video to that one?
That one is pretty out there.
What I like is that she's not afraid to be different.
That is so true of her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see Lady Gaga in concert in Las Vegas?
I'd love to go, where and when is the concert?
It's at the T-Mobile Arena this August
Okay, I will try to get tickets.
I hope she sings Born This Way because that's my favorite
That's a great song, but my favorite is Just Dance.
That's a great classic, what other songs to you like?
Well, Bad Romance is another of my favorites.
Maybe she will sing all of those in her concert.
I hope so, I can't wait to see her performance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that Lady Gaga music video?
Do you mean MILLION REASONS?
Yes, it made me cry.
Yeah, it was like how she feels.
She has a hard job.
She is always busy.
But she just needed one good reason to stay.
It was cool to see her getting ready for the show.
And to see things from her perspective.
I am glad she is staying.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I would say Bad Romance.
That is a fun song, but I like something more for the club.
Oh I see. Like Poker Face?
Exactly. It's got a great dance beat.
What do you think of Born this Way then?
I like the message, but it's not very dance-y.
I would agree.
I also think it's a little too much like Madonna's music.
Like Lady Gaga should get her own style and not steal hers? I get it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Lady GaGa at the Superbowl?
Yup, and I'm so glad she did Poke Face as an opener.
Me, too. It's one of my favorite songs by her.
What did you think of that Bad Romance performance?
I thought it was great, but Telephone was the stand-out.
I was so impressed with how she sang and danced at the same time.
It's crazy. I couldn't even hear any backing track.
It was there, but it was very faint.
You know she's not even the best dancer, but she killed it that night.
I agree. She totally blew me away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like lady gagas music
Yes i love her music
Thats good
Do you like her music
I love her music just not her looks
She does go a little crazy with her looks
Too much freedom of expression
Yea just a little bit
A lot she wore a dress made out of meat
Thats true
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever like Lady Gaga's music?
Not when it was popular. I used to loathe the music and everyone else thought it was popular.
Do you still hate her music?
She's a good artist. After about 5 years, I started to listen to her music.
Which songs do you like?
Bad Romance, and Papparazi are good songs.
Are there any songs of hers that you don't care for?
Born this way. Sounds too much like a bad Madonna.
Yes, I agree. Some people think that she doesn't sound like Madonna.
She's just like Madonna. In sound and in antics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady gaga is a little too out there for me with her out fits.
She is a statement maker for sure.
I mean seriously a dress made out of meat! Gross and yucky!
She knew what to do to get people to notice her.
Well notice her we did.
I have never really listened to her albums
Yeah I only hear her latest pop song on the radio.If I listen to the radio
Music is getting so boring that people like Lady Gaga have to do something to get noticed
Well cheers to you Lady Gaga. I hope it keeps working for you
Count me out...
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder how experimental She will be on her new album
Has she been experimental before
Of course she has
I mean she does look the part i guess
Well she acts it oo
I would like some experimental music more often
I know its cool
New stuff is always better
Yep you can only refine whats already good
Precisely my thoughts
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I am in the mood to make a new CD today. Do you want to help?
Sure, I'd love to!
Great! You can help me find some different songs to listen to.
What kind of music are you in to?
Country is my favorite. I love new and old country, it doesn't really matter.
How about some Reba McEntire or Dolly Parton?
Sure I like them a lot. What are some of their most popular songs?
Jolene, 9 to 5, and I Will Always Love You for Dolly and The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia, Fancy, and The Greatest Man I Never Knew for Reba.
Oh those are great songs. I had forgotten all about them.
Yeah, I love the older country songs a lot!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga now? It seems like she's losing her edge.
I totally agree. Her first album was so amazing.
Yeah,  The Fame had some really great singles on it. I used to listen to Paparazzi all the time in the car.
Oh my god. Me too! I loved Alejandro as well. That music video was steamy!
Oh yeah, I remember it was really controversial when it came out.
Did you know she used to write for Britney Spears?
Really? I had no idea. I knew she grew up in New York.
Yeah, I knew someone that went to high school with her.
Wow, that's funny. Did they still talk?
Oh, no. They were never friends.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
It was AWESOME!!!
You think?
Yea her propelling down like that!
Yea that was pretty cool!
I thought she might get hurt!
It did seem dangerous!
Yea, but that's part of why it's fun!
I hear that!
Gaga rules!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What outfit of lady gaga's do you want to wear most.
The meat dress of course!
Oh gross! That is my last pick.
What it is awesome. So iconic and fun.
I would feel so sick , I bet it smelled awful and would be super heavy.
You bring up some good points. what would you want to wear?
I would go with her outfit in just dance.
Why?It is a little boring considering all her looks.
Well I think it is like an 80s superhero almost rainbow brite like and I love it.
I suppose the fabric sheen is shimmery and fun and that bow. It is an iconic Gaga look.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Have you ever seen Lady Gaga live?
No I never have.  Have you?
I have been to 4 of her live shows.
Wow that is quite a bit.
She puts on such a great show.
What makes it so great?
It's so theatrical I love it.
I can see how she would put on a good show.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I like Poker Face the most
That's one is pretty classic. And so catchy!
I also like Bad Romance, one of her most famous songs!
I miss the old music she made
It was so edgy and controversial sometimes
Yeah, her lyrics and her costumes were crazy
Do you have any other songs you still listen to?
I still like Just Dance, it makes me want to dance!
I miss her old stuff, but I like anything she makes too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could see any musician in concert, who would it be?
Hmm I'm not sure. Probably Lady Gaga.
Oh, that's a good choice! I love her.
Yeah, she's one of my favorites.
Yeah, I feel like she'd be great in concert.
I hear her shows are amazing.
Do you like her newest album?
You know not really, I'm not really a country fan. I like her older stuff.
I like Joanne, but I know a lot of people don't.
Yeah, I mean lyrically it's good, but I think it's the wrong genre. Most of her fans are into pop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I thought lady Gaga touring with Tony Bennett was great.
Yes,a unique pairing.
That's for sure.
Both have great voices.
Yes they do.
Love when do,baby it's cold outside.
Great song done well.
Their album cheek to cheek was a big seller.
Big success for both.
That was also a good song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you ever listen to Lady Gaga?
Of course, she's always on the radio.
What's your favorite song by her?
Just Dance.  I know it's an oldie, but it's my favorite.
Yeah, that was a really great song.  Have you ever heard her track Judas?
No I haven't.
It's a lesser known song but it's great.  You should definitely check it out.
Okay, I'll do that.  Is it anything like Just Dance?
No, not really.  It's a newer song and her music has evolved a bit so it's different, but if you like Lady Gaga I'm sure you'll like this song.
Okay, I'll check it out.  Thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey you like Lady Gaga?
Nah not really
WHY NOT?
Because her songs are so boring, like Bad Romance is just another pop song.
What about Born this way?
What about it
Doesn't it make you feel like strutting down a walkway like a dork?
...Kinda
So you do like Lady Gaga then
YES I DO but don't tell my wife.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Lady Gaga's song "The Cure", I think it's newish.
Yes, I really like it.
It's very simple, but Gaga makes it interesting.
I agree, she can turn anything into gold.
I don't think it's getting much radio play, though.
Yeah, I'm very confused on radio plays and singles nowadays.
I agree, I think the artists pays for plays to be honest.
It's supposed to be looked down upon, but you know it's going on.
That's why you only hear certain songs over and over again.
And that's why I only listen to Spotify!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to any Lady Gaga lately?
Yes I have.
What album have you been listening to?
Paparazzi.
That is a classic song.
Do you think she has a great voice?
Definitely.
At least she does not need auto tune.
You can say that again.
It was nice to talk to you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the newer Lady Gaga stuff?
Not really. I like her older stuff.
Did you like Joanne?
It is okay. But, The Fame is much better.
What is on that album?
Poker Face
That is one of her most famous songs
Yeah and it is my favorite
Did you like her costumes?
Yeah, that is a big part of why I like her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know you're a Lady Gaga fan, but what's your favorite song?
Hmmm,  that's a tough question.  She has so many good ones.
Yes, I know.  But which one or two really stick out to you?
Okay, even though it may sound a bit lame, I'm going with Poker Face.
That's a not lame at all.  That would probably be my choice also.
It's just so catchy.  It's hard not to sing along when it comes on the radio.
Did you ever see the South Park episode that had Cartman singing it?
That was awesome!!! It might be one reason why hearing this song always makes me smile.
All right, now that we've established your first choice.  What's your second favorite song?
I'm going with Just Dance.  It's one of my favorite songs to run to with that great beat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga?
I do. What about you?
Yea, but I like the early Lady Gaga stuff better than the stuff she came out with lately.
Agreed. She is very talented.
She is, but she can be a little too weird for me at times.
True, but I like weird. i think she is a pioneer.
Truth!! She is unique and the music world needs more singers like her.
I couldn't agree more. Do you like Bad Romance?
Of course. I think it may be my favorite song.
Mine too. All of the songs on that album are great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
I hated it!
WHY!?
So cliche..
The drop though...
Yea, it's been done
But...
No butts it just sucked!
Totally on a different page
To each their own?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the song million reasons.
That's lady Gaga right?
Yes it is.
Love the song.
Loved her singing it at the SUPERBOWL.
Yes,no lipsincing.
No,it was live.
Unlike a lot of stars
I didn't realize she could dance that good.
She's an all around talented performer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Didn't Lady Gaga used to write songs for other artists?
Yes she did.
I heard brittney spears was one of them.
Yes,and also new kids on the block.

XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the latest Lady Gaga single?
I'm not sure, what is it?
'The Cure', it's called. A little different from her other stuff.
I have heard it actually, I love it! I really like that she's ditched the gimmicky stuff.
Me too. She's a really talented musician.
She's always been a great singer but I didn't know how much she writes.
Yeah! All of her own stuff and some for other people.
She writes songs for other people?
Yes, she always has. She's a great songwriter.
I'll have to find some other stuff she's written.

She's really inspiring singer
I agree, and her lyrics are really inspiring
I wish I can be as talented as her
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Lady Gaga cohost on RuPaul's Drag Race?
Yes! She was so great! It was so nice seeing her on the set.
I know, especially since they're almost impersonating her anyways. I loved when they lip synced to her, "Poker Face."
Speaking of "Poker Face", what's your favorite song by her overall?
I think I'd say it's, "Born This Way" since it has so much meaning behind it.
I really like the meaning behind it as well, but the beat is not my favorite.
That's true. As far as beats go, I think I like "Applause."
That beat is amazing! And the video is phenomenal.
Her videos are always great. They're so flashy and unique.
I agree! Lady Gaga is sure one of a kind. Can't wait to see what she comes up with next.

Pop music is my favorite music.

I wouldn't say I'm a fan but some of her music is okay.
I like some too. I'm having a hard time remembering the names of her songs though.
I like her song "Poker Face". I listened to that over and over.
That was actually really good I remember that song!
I think she's kind of different though.
I know, she does like a little strange.
Not bad music though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into Lady Gaga's music?
Somewhat.
What is your favorite song by her?
Bad Romance.
Oh I like that song a lot.
Did you see the video?

Not yet.
We should definitely go see her!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Lady Gaga went to  Convent of the Sacred Heart high school?
I did know that, my cousin was in her class. They have a great theater program!
I wonder if she ever did musicals while she was there?
She did actually, my cousin was in two of them with her.
Wow, that's crazy! Do you know which musicals?
I do, she was in Guys and Dolls and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.
I love Guys and Dolls. Its one of my favorite musicals.
Me too. I have seen it a bunch of times!
Does your cousin still keep in contact with Lady Gaga?
No, they weren't really close in high school. They just knew each other from theater.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Lady Gaga?
She is pretty.
Where is she from?
She is from NYC.
How much do you think her net worth is?
Her net worth is probably $30 million.
What are her parents last name?
I think it is Germanotta.
I hope to see her in concert.
It would be cool to go see her concert.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't stop listening to telephone!
Is that a new band?
No it's a lady Gaga song.
Oh, the old one?
It's not that old but yes.
Is that the one she did with Beyonce?
Yeah, it's so catchy.
I really liked the music video to that song.
I don't think I've seen it. I'll have to youtube it.
It's really good. You should.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the set list for the Super Bowl?
You mean, the Lada Gaga's music?
Yes, her halftime performance was amazing!
I like hearing the newer material.
The stuff from Joanne?
Yes, it sounded great.
I preferred hearing her older material.
Like what?
Bad Romance is a classic.
True. It was also nice to hear Poker Face.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know Lady Gaga?
Haha, yeah. That meat dress is classic.
What do you think about her most recent album?
I didn't really think it was as good as "The Fame" or "Born This Way."
Really!
Yeah, it just wasn't as good quality.
Interesting. What do you think your favorite song of hers is?
Probably "Poker Face," what about you?
I think "Bad Romance."
Yeah, that one's my second favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How old was Lady Gaga when she released her first song?
I think she was twenty?
Hm. That's young for such good music.
Right? Poker Face was great
I'm always impressed with how good she is at playing the piano
Yes. She has a lot of talent for a pop star.
I think her David Bowie tribute was great.
Yes, I liked that too.
What do you think of Joanne?
It's got a lot of male influence
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
Too fun!
Yea her music was awesome!
I didnt know she could sing so well live
I know what you mean
Most performers dont perform THAT well live
Yea you almost wonder if she was lip syncing
Yea but she wouldnt
I agree
Never gaga!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the most overrated Lady Gaga song?
Honestly, probably Million Reasons.
Really? I thought it was nice that that song was a little more sophisticated than her older music.
Eh, I would rather listen to Monster or Bad Romance.
That's funny because those are the songs I find most overrated.
Are you serious? Those songs are classic.
I don't think they give her much credit. Lady Gaga is much more talented than those songs.
You've got to be out of your mind. I love near the end of the Bad Romance when you can hear all the emotion in Lady Gaga's voice.
Yeah, but Million Reasons actually has more meaning behind it.
I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Lady Gaga won a Grammy with Tony Bennett?
I think I heard that.
Wow,he's 90 and she's 31 maybe.
It was an album of jazz standards.
Well that's Tony Bennett for sure.
I've heard them together before. They are really good.
They are very good.
She won a jazz competition when she was 14.
Wow,no kidding?
Yes,that's true
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know Weird Al's parody of Lady Gaga's Born This Way?
Yeah! I actually like it a lot more than the original, not being a Lady Gaga fan.
Have you given her music a shot?
I haven't really had to. I mean, it's so popular I'm accosted with it when I go out or when I stay in.
When you stay in?
Yeah, like I was watching American Idol with someone and she was one of the people performing in between the contestants.
What did she perform?
Poker Face.
And what did you think of that?
That was enough for me to know I wouldn't really care for her music in general.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about lee William mother day greatest gospel bowl,
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF it, was it good?
HE WAS SINGING LOTS OF SONGS TO THE MOTHERS, IT WAS VERY GOOD.
that sound very interesting.
how will you like to go to one next mother day?
I WILL LOVE THAT IF I CAN GO WITH YOU.
SHOW YOU CAN I NO YOU WILL ENJOY IT,WILL YOU LIKE TO BRING A FRIEND?
YES THAT WILL BE GOOD I NO JUST THE RIGHT ONE.
SO I WILL LET YOU NO WHEN THE NEXT ONE IS.
THANKS, I WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD  TO THAT TIME THANKS AGAIN.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's so nice to see Lady Gaga branch out in her music.
I agree. I think people underestimated her singing ability when she first became really popular.
Oh I think so too, but her album with Tony Bennett really shows of her vocal ability.
What was that called again?
Cheek to Cheek. It won a Grammy.
Wow, that's amazing.
She sounds great in her new song Million Reasons, as well.
I agree. I like her songs that have a slower tempo like Dope.
I love that song. I think I heard it was about her battle with addiction.
Wow, it must be such a meaningful song to her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga?
I like her, she gives me a sense of Madonna, but she is original as well.
Do you listen to her music?
Yes, one of my favorite songs of hers is Paparazzi.
Have you ever seen her in concert?
No but i do watch her live performances.
Have you bought any of her albums?
No, but i have a couple of her songs dowloaded.
Would you ever want to meet Lady Gaga?
I would love to meet her and express how i think she is a great pop star.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you like most about lady gaga?
well, it's a very interesting question, first I respect lady gaga
yea?
you know it's tough to stand out from the over-crowded music industry, she made it out on her own, I think that's a powerful message
indeed, she's a tough girl, I admire artists that's trying to spread out good music around the world
yea, aside from the spirit part. I do think her music is very unique, maybe that's what made her famous in the first place
I feel her music lies between being too artistic and being too ruthless like rap music
that's the magic part of it, isn't it.
haha, indeed, I gotta go check out her new music videos on Youtube
for sure, her music videos have always been entertaining.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of Lady Gaga?
No, I'm not familiar with a lot of music out today.
Really?
Yeah, I like stuff from the 80s.
Well, it's funny you say that, I feel like Lady Gaga is kind of an 80s throwback.  You should check her out.
Oh really?  Who is she most like?
Think female David Bowie.
That's interesting!  Bowie was a legend.  I might have to check her out.
You really should, she's amazing!
I'll give her a listen when I get home.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's music?
Yes, I think she is fantastic.
Me, too. What is your favorite of her songs?
I think my favorite Lady Gaga song is "Love Game", because it is so fun. How about you?
I like "Alejandro", because of the music video. Are there any Lady Gaga songs you don't like?
I'm not very fond of "The Edge of Glory". It sounds kind of generic to me.
Really? I liked "The Edge of Glory" a lot--I found it inspirational.
Personally, I found "Born This Way" more inspirational than "The Edge of Glory".
I can see that. "Born This Way" is great for encouraging people to be themselves.
I agree. That's why I like it a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard that new Justin Beiber Song?
Which one? I feel like he has a new song every day now.
The spanish one.
Oh that Despacito one? I don't think that's a Justin Beiber song, he is just featured on it.
Oh well that makes sense then.
What do you mean?
Well, he doesn't even know the words to the song.
Really? That's messed up.
I saw him at  a concert, and when that song started to play, he just said "Blah blah" for most of the words.
Wow, that's pathetic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga's video TELEPHONE is cool.
I like the big black hat she wears.
I think that is when she got bailed out of prison.
And she wears that CRIME SCENE tape when she is in her cell.
I like when she is in the prison yard.
She has those cigarette glasses.
She was rich in prison.
Her yellow hair telephone was the best.
But everyone got poisoned.
She was bad that day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Lady Gaga coming out with a new album?
I think she is because she sang a new song at her Coachella performance.
Cool, I can't wait to hear more. Did you see how many people were at her show at Coachella?
Yes there was a huge crowd.
What's your favorite video by Lady Gaga?
If I have to choose one it would be Bad Romance. How about you?
I would have to say it would be Telephone.
I like that one too. It was like over 9 minutes long.
It was almost like a mini television show.
Her hair in those pop cans was so cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe Gaga ever had a weight issue?
It is hard to believe she looks so petite.
It is weird to think of her as fat kid, but guess she was.
I think it makes me like her more.
Why would that make you like her more?
I think because she is really real. Very human to struggle with weight.
I do like that she is honest about it. Probably helps some girls out there knowing she went through issues too.
Exactly. I was a concert and she addressed this about herself and I thought that was very brave and helpful to many.
That is cool. She had so much impact on her fans nice she sends out positive helpful messages.
I respect her a lot for that and her talent of course.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
I feel they could have done better
They?
Her and her crew
I think it was good
Why?
It was very "gaga"
I guess..
We just htink differently
Maybe so
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Lady Gaga fan
I am, she is a hell of a singer
Her songs are fun and your right, she can really sing.
I heard her sing live on Howard Stern and she was amazing!
I saw her in concert with my wife a few months ago.  It was a great show.
I like her newer song "million reasons"
I do also!  I also like the old ones like poker face and  ban romance.
She can really play the piano good also
I didn't know that.  That's cool to know
She really is one of the most talented artist that have come along in quite a while
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whatever happened to Lady Gaga? Haven't heard much about her, except last time when she performed at the Superbowl halftime.
I feel like she fell of the map. It's a shame, she's a really great singer and piano player.
Exactly! The Fame Monster is probably one of my favorite pop albums of all time.
I totally agree it's a good album, but I'm more partial to her debut album, The Fame.
Oh really? What's your favorite song on that album?
Hard to say, but I really love Paparazzi and Poker Face.
Can't go wrong with Poker Face, that's the song that made her blow up.
Yeah, did you ever see her perform the piano version of it? It was so full of emotion and talent.
Of course I have, the thing I love about Lady Gaga is that she's a great artist even without the studio effects.
Amen to that! I hope she goes on tour soon, I'd love to see her live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I totally love how much Lady Gaga feels her music when she sings.
I have to totally agree and what a free spirit she is.
Yes, I love that she doesn't care what anybody else thinks about her.
She is so into being different and yet she relates to so many people with her music.
When she did the David Bowie tribute I could really feel her heart.
Everyone felt it.  She is ironic in the way she connects with her fans.
What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I would have to say my favorite song is Poker Face. You?
My favorite is Born This Way because it touches a subject on equality and that means something.
That is a great song.  I hope to see her in concert sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Lady Gaga's duets album?
I thought it was interesting that she was able to get such a wide variety of artists.
It was interesting that Tony Bennet sang with her.
Are they both from New Jersey?
I'm not sure.  I know that Lady Gaga's real name is Stephanie or something like that.
That's funny.  She doesn't look like a Stephanie.
I agree.  I wonder what prompted her to take on that name.
A lot of artists adopt alter egos and personas.
Yes, I could see doing that for one's music career.
Nobody wants someone named Stephanie singing to them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of lady Gagas last album.
I believe it was Joanne deluxe.
Isn't Joanne her real name.
Yes,middle name I think.
You know any songs off it?
Yes,Joanne is good and John Wayne.
I've heard dancin in circles and Perfect illusion from it.
They are good tunes
Another is of course million reasons
It's the big hit
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Do you like any of Lady Gaga's songs?
Yeah sure there are a few that I know.
Which ones?
When poker face came out I liked it.  Pretty catchy.
Was that her first big hit?
I don't really know.
It was all over the radio that is for sure.
Yeah it really was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
I hate her music
Why?..
She's to simple
Simple as in..?
Her lyrics
I think they're unique?..
I think they're over done
Maybe?
Just listen to them.  Nothing THAT unique
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
It was just okay
Really?
Yea, what did you think?
I hated it!
I totally thought you'd say that you'd like it
Yea, I used to
I see
Yea she just got old to me
...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get to listen to Lady Gaga's album called the Remix?
When did it come out?
March 3, 2010 is when it came out.
I think I have heard some of the songs from it, if Poker Face was on it.
Yes , that is definitely on that album.  Another one is Dance in the Dark.
Just Dance is also on it , and that is one of the best songs she ever did.
It is a great pop dance song for sure.
The label was Streamline for that production of the album.
She is one of my favorite singers.
She is also extremely wealthy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get around to listening to the Lady Gaga album that came out last year?
You know I haven't really listened to her since the "Bad Romance" days.
The new CD is definitely worth a listen! She's got a powerhouse of a voice.
Are there any standout tracks?
There's a beautiful ballad type song, "Million Reasons." But I do admit it's not quite up to the level of her older music.
How do you think she's maturing as an artist?
She's more restrained now, I think. Maybe a little less flashy? The huskiness of her voice comes through more now.
Her earlier music added a lot of distractions to her voice. I think I'd like this style more.
I think so, too! Also check out the track, "A-YO." That's a fun dancing song.
Could always use a good song to wake up to in the morning!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many albums has Lady Gaga put out.
Wow,that's a tough question.
She's had a lot.
I know she has.
Isn't it around 18 or 19.
I think so.
Her last one is Joanne deluxe,I know that.
I remember the fame,cheek to cheek,born this way.
Wow,pretty good memory
I like her a lot
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think is lady Gaga most interesting song/video.
Lady Gaga - Machete Kills-aura.
I think that is often an overlooked song of hers.
ya it was not one of her biggest but I find it really intriguing.
I think there is an interesting message the idea of behind the aura.
Ya it is pretty deep if you really examine the lyrics in it.
I enjoy that it has so many parts to it.
It almost feles like a mini movie in itself.
Yes, it is super layered. I loved the beat  and the machine voice /robot voice.
It is super interesting. Exactly  why I choose that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the the Gaga?
You mean the woman who wore the meat dress.
Thats the one! Your thoughts?
I dont know, I prefer the classics. I'm a beatles fan.
What! Too new age for you?
Yeah, always thought she was a little bit weird.
Really now. She's weirder than a bunch of old brits?
What can I say, I like the classics.
Well I guess we are just trapped in a bad romance.
You're awful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of Lady Gaga's songs impacts you the most?
In what sense?
Emotionally.  Which song impacts you emotionally?
I'd have to say it's "Million Reasons."  There's just so much pain and anguish in that song, but also so beautiful.
I really like that song too.  Though I personally feel that there isn't much to that song outside of the chorus.
That's a good point.  But once she starts belting out those notes, all else is forgiven.
She has such a powerful voice.  It gives me chills.
Did you know it debuted at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100?
That doesn't surprise me.  I believe in total, she has had 24 songs total make it onto Billboard Hot 100.
That is truly impressive, and speaks volumes about her talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many albums have lada gaga published to date?
not sure, I feel she's not as famous as she was few years ago, so I lost track
I feel the same, her poker face album was perhaps the most famous one
yea, back then, I heard them being played everywhere on the street
such a sensation, isn't it
yeah, recently she published another album called JOANNE, I think it's good as well
so what song should I listen to first if I get the album?
Grigio Girls
why is that
I think she dedicated that song to her best friends, it has soul in it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is yoir favorite pop singer
Definitely lady gaga
She has so much energy
And a wierd taste of wardrobe
Yes she is the craziest dresser i have seen

That album was amazing.
I feel it was underrated though.
Very true actually.
Anyways great talking to you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite lady Gaga Music video
I think bad romance was the best
Why do you think so?
The use of costumes and colors was so unique at the time, nobody else was doing that
Thats true, it was a very unique video both in song and style

Not even Born this Way?
No not yet
I recommend it. It's a very heart touching video
i'll have to check it out then
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite album by Lady Gaga?
It would probably have to be The Fame, but I like all of them.
The Fame had some pretty big hits.
Oh, I know. I could listen to Paparazzi and Just Dance all day.
Me too, but I prefer her album The Fame Monster.
That one's probably my second favorite.
I tend to like her older music.
Me too. Her style was just so outrageous back then.
I know. It was see fun to see all the crazy outfits she wore.
I still can't believe she wore a dress of meat to the MTV Music Video Awards.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga?
Yes, she is one of the best.
What song do you like of hers?
Paparazzi
I like that one too
I love her costumes

Did you like the halftime show?
Yes, I did
She did a lot of cool stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Lady Gaga?
Yes.  My favorite song is Born This Way.  What is your favorite song?
I enjoy Born This Way and that entire album.  Do you like the other songs on the album?
Yes, I also enjoy You and I.  How long ago was that album released?
The Born This Way album came out in 2011.
Have you seen Lady Gaga in concert?
Yes.  I was able to see her in New York a few years ago.  She was incredible!
She was also incredible acting in American Horror Story!  Have you seen that show?

It was on in 2015.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga?
I like her style.
She looks like she doesn't gove a crap what people think about her.
Probably not.
I like the song Monster.
I don't remember that one.  What about paparazzi?
The lyrics to that were good.  It has a good message.
So does Born Thos Way.  Inspiration in song.
What about Alejandro?
Those lyrics are pretty elementary.  Don't call my name Alejandro.  Gorl had Alejandro issues.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Lady Gaga's songs?
I like her music.  She has an original sound and strong voice.
Is she the one that sings Poker Face?
Yes, she sings that song.  It has a dark musical tone.
I heard the song was tribute of some kind.
I think she contributed the song to her boyfriends.
Did she wrote Poker Face?
I heard she did along with RedOne who also produced it.
What was the main idea about Poker Face?
Poker face is about sex, money and gambling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I would say poker face.
Was that her first big hit?
I think Just dance may have been, I am not sure which was first.
Well they are for sure both form her first album,The fame.
That is right. Came out in 2008 I believe.
It is crazy it was that long ago. She still feels like a new artist to me.
I think she is super established at this stage.
I agree she is like an institution. But maybe just how she is always coming up with something new and different feels fresh.
I can see how she is a new artist in originality in that sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Lady Gaga's album Artpop?
I thought it was great, but it didn't seem to be as popular as her other albums.
I agree, but it did have some hit singles.
Definitely. I loved Applause when I first heard it on the radio, and I still love it.
That is a great song, but I liked Do What U Want more than Applause.
I never expected her to collaborate with R. Kelly.
I didn't expect it either, but they really complimented each other on that song.
My favorite Lady Gaga collaboration was when she starred on Beyonce's song Video Phone.
I would love to see them collaborate again sometime in the future.
Me too. They are both great singers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Lady Gaga performance?
Actually, it was her Julie Andrews tribute on the Oscars.
That wasn't exactly classic Gaga.
That's exactly why I loved it. Who knew she could do Julie Andrews standards from movies like The Sound of Music and do it like she was born to it?
How did the crowd like it?
I think they were kind of thrown by the ball gown and the tattoos, but the singing, it was amazing.
Was Julie Andrews there?
Yes, she came on at the end of the number and gave Lady Gaga a big hug. She was very emotional.
Aw, that sounds like a really sweet moment.
It was awesome seeing the two of them arm in arm, but totally bonded by their shared love of that music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how do you like the newest Lady Gaga's album?
Are you talking about "Joanne?" Yes I love it!
What do you love about the album?
I don't know it just sounds different from her previous album. It is not like I don't like her other albums though.
I like the song "Hey Girl" from that album.
Why do you like that song so much?
Well, it features my other favorite singer; Florence Welch.
Also that song has this late 80s and early 90s vibe in it.
I agree. It has that electric acoustics as background music.
I agree. Also the beat is so 90s!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Lady Gaga album is your favorite?
I really loved The Fame and still listen to it regularly.
That was such a good album! I think that one is my favorite too.
Yeah, I love the song Boys Boys Boys off of it a lot. It has that fun summer feel.
I'm pretty sure I had that album on repeat the whole summer.
Same here. Which song was your favorite?
I would say Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say) was my favorite. All the songs are so catchy though it's hard to choose.
Oh man I totally agree. Her early work was some of my favorite music.
All her old work was perfect music for summer road trips or going to the club. I want to go listen to it right now!
I'm about to go home and listen to it too now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hello

Nothing much just thinking

Who
Well Gaga she is actually good and has kept popularity
Well that is true
It is quite impressive
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear lady gaga's song on the radio today?
Yes, but they didn't play the whole song.
What song was it?
It was bad romance.
Oh, I don't like that song.
Well which song do you like?
I like born this way?
Why do you like that song?
I like it because she tells about her life.
That's good, I'm sure others can relate to it too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you beleive how many hit songs lady Gaga has had?
I know. I can't believe how long she's been around.
What is your favorite of her songs?
I'm a leo so I like Appluase.

Do you like Million Reason?
That one isn't as good
I agree. But edge of Glory is great
I don't like born this way
Yeah that is a weird message.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Kelly did Akon at one time signed Lady Gaga on his Konvict music label.
oh yes gaga started as a Konvict music artist before she was signed unto Sony music.
because a closer listen to her debut single "poker face" has that Konvict signature tune at the beginning.
yes when she did "poker face" she was still with Konvict Music hence the reason the Konvict signature tune was sampled.
Sony did a good job with her though.
well i would rather say lady gaga did a good job for Sony Music because she was dropping hit songs after hit songs and Sony don't need to promo much as songs are instant hot from first week.
my all time lady gaga song was "alehandro" although the song had so many controversy.
lady gaga has  always been controversial, from her style of dressing, her videos, you name it lol
that's true though there is always something to watch out for when she's performing.
she really put her best when it comes to live performance,her choreography, down to stage management is just superb.
XXXXXXXXXXX

I get song titles and singers messed up sometimes
She's an excellent singer.
She really is.
I'd like to see her in concert.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite Lady Gaga songs is Bad Romance.
Yeah I like the video with her laying with a skeleton.
I like that Lady Gaga sings with Tony Bennett who is a legend.
She looks so great in the Macy's Christmas commercial.
I love Lady Gaga's Born This Way.
She has this one dance move that I love in the video.
Lady Gaga's newer song is about abuse.
Yes whenever she sings it she tears up.  Lady Gaga is a strong activist.

Do you like lady gaga?
Yes a ton, doesn't everyone?
Well I do. My brother's wife hates her.
What, why? That seems crazy to me.
Ya hard to figure out. But she even banned lady gaga music at her wedding even!
What? That is too bad. Lady Gaga is great dance music.
Tell me about it. It was very upsetting to me. Poker face was at it's height of popularity at the time.
Also Just dance was popular during the poker face days as well.
Exactly we just wanted TO dance to the big hits of the day. But denied big time.
Does she still dislike her? She has come out with so many great songs since then, telephone, bad romance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do like the music videos from lady gaga?
Absolutely, they are some of the most unique ones out there.
I think so too, she is always ahead of the other artists.
I love her sense of style too.
She always seems to be pushing the bounds of fashion.
She is definitely a true trend setter, not a follower.
And she is a great musician on top of all of that.
Definitely, songs like alejandro and just dance are some of my favorites by any artist.
Those are great, I really like paparrazi as well.
There are so many that its hard to remember all of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.

I can't stop listening to lady GAGA!!
Haha, her songs always get stuck in my head.
I know, me too. I swear I've been walking around humming bad romance for like five years.
Have you listened to Eh, Eh?
Yeah, I think so.
It's older, from her first album.
Yeah, I've seen the music video. Set in little italy right?
Yeah that's the one. I freaking love that song so much. I can't believe it wasn't played more.
I know it seems like the radio only picks 2-3 songs off every album to play and forgets the rest.
Yeah, it's a shame. It's such a good song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to lady gaga
Yes i do
I love her new album, joanne

Oh okay, thats probably why
I love millions reasons

Its a good song
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite female singer?
I kike Adele a lot, but I have to say Lady Gaga is my alltime favorite.
Oh really?  Which songs of hers do you like?
I like her duo piece with Tony Bennett, It Don't Mean a Thing.
Hadn't heard that one.
Yeah its nice.  Some others are Fashion and Bad Romance.
Those are good.
They did a cute video on Glee of Bad Romance.
I saw it, it was funny.  Loved the costumes.
Yep.  She has the chops and the angst to pull those songs off, like Sinead O'Connor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why so glum?
Glum? I'm not glum.
Your look forelorn.
This is my pokerface.
Who are you? Lady Gaga?
Not quite. And I'm wearing a polyester leisure suit...not a feather boa with sequins..
That look could work for you.
Thanks, but I don't have her pipes.
Let me hear your best Lady Gaga singing.
I make it a point to only sing Gaga in the bathroom. 'm trying to avoid the darker side of fame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga's music?
I think it is wonderful.
I wish she came out with more albums.
She just came out with one though recently.
Yeah but that is not yearly though.
What is your opinion of the new music?
It is good but not as good as the old.
I agree on that.
She should go back to her old sound.
She needs to be more club music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do  you think about Lady Gaga's poker face?
I think it is one of the best songs, next to born this way!
I totally forgot about born this way, it's one of my favorites too!
She has such an amazing voice when she sings.

All Hail GAGA!

It is a little too over the top for me.
I understand what you mean, not really for me either.
But I do think she has talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the name Joanne came from Lady Gaga's aunt?
I didn't know that. I just knew this album felt more personal.
Yeah. It's way more stripped down.
That makes sense. I heard she was touring dive bars.
So what's your favorite song from Joanne?
I like John Wayne. It feels tough.
I like that the album has an almost country music feel in places.
I thought so too. But like, good country music.
Yeah. I'm listening to Perfect Illusion right now.
Have you heard her perform it acoustically yet? It's incredible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
It sucked!

Definitely not
Shes too extreme with her outfits
Yes they are wild for my taste
Mine too
XXXXXXXXXXX
I  miss Lady Gaga's earlier work.
Her early work was good, but her new stuff isn't bad.
It's not as good as her early stuff though.
What's your favorite early song?
Either Poker Face or Just Dance.  How bout you?
Are we talking first album?
Yeah.
Oh, Papparazi off that album is my favorite.
I will say though that I am glad she's done with the theatrics.
I think that may just have to do with growing up a bit as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Lady Gaga is touring again?
Yes! I am so excited. I've always wanted to see her.
You got tickets for her show?
Yes, I was able to get tickets for the Philadelphia show.
That's awesome. I love her dance music.
I like that, but I actually really like her new stuff even better.
I guess I haven't heard much of it. Is it a lot different?
Well, it is still pop music, but it is much less electronic.
That's probably a nice change.
It is because you can really hear her talent because her voice doesn't sound like it is as manipulated.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady gaga has some crazy outfits
I know, she hardly ever wears anything normal
Didnt she have an outfit made put of meat one time?
I think so
It sounds like something she would do
And she had an outfit made out of bubbles
Thats wierd
Not as wierd as the meat
I also saw an outfit made out of alien dolls
She has so much confidence
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about Lady Gaga in general?
I think she is super talented.
I agree but sometimes she seems a bit extra.
Yes what was going on with the meat dress?
I am glad that she is now focused on her talent.
I loved how she sang with Tony Bennet.
I also loved when she did the tribute to Julie Andrews.
I think that is where she first showed her operatic side.
I know what a difference than when she first came out.
The beginning she was just an electronic artist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to (Gaga's new-ish album) Joanne yet?
No, but I like the singles I've heard so far. Anything that takes us away from the memory of Artpop…
Oh my goodness, I know, right? She even had the sense to keep it out of that halftime show.
Yeah, I hope she's realized its best to leave all of that era in the past. She went full Art School Kid and it was bad.
Very very cringey. This Joanne phase seems to be a lot more grounded. I'm not sure I understand the hats but I I ever understand her hats?
Ha, fair point. At least she's stopped referring to hats as vital organs. "asking me to remove my hat is like asking me to remove my liver" Oh please.
Back to the music, cause if we stick with the fashion, we'll just be confused, I like the genre shift in Joanne and Cheek To Cheek to less dancehall and more, everything else. She's best with a simple backing.
Yes yes yes. Keep it simple! She's got the voice and the talent. Not everything has to be remixed with 12 guests and a yak.
A yaaaaaaaak! She would. You know that's gonna be the midlife crisis Madonna phase: yak music.
And yet, it will sell and we'll all dance to it. Gaga is a witch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever hear any of the cheek to cheek album?
I don't know it at all.
Oh, it is a collaboration between Gaga and Tony Bennet.
Really? That seems like an odd combo.
I supposoe but I really enjoyed it.
What songs are on the album?
It has mainly Jazz standards. the idea is they wanted to bring these songs to younger generations.
That is a pretty cool project. What songs exactly?
Well there are many, but The Lady is a Tramp, I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Anything goes.
I think that sounds cool. I will have to find this cheek to cheek album and give it a listen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Lady Gaga at the Super Bowl.
What did you think?
First time I ever heard her.  Probably the last time too.
I'm sure she'll be heartbroken.
Just not my thing.  And what was she wearing?
I think they're called clothes.
They barely fit her.  It wasn't kid appropriate.
Kids should usually be playing outside during Super Bowl anyway.
All I know is I will not let my kids listen to or watch her from this point forward.
Whatever you want to do, it's your life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to Lady Gaga?
Occasionally.
What songs?
I like Bad Romance.
The beginning bothers me.
Why?
It is incredibly long.
I can see that.
The video is alright though.
I just wish it was a collaboration
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you know Lady Gaga's music?
I only know the popular hits.
Like Poker face and songs like that?
Yeah just like that.
I'm in the same boat, I don't know too much about her.
I know she recently came out with a new album.
Oh really?  I didn't know that.
Yeah, I haven't listened to it though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to talk about music
Sure i love music
Great
Whos your favorite artist
Definitely lady gaga
Shes going to be an icon
Do you like her
Yes she is a great performer
Yes she is
Love her music
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard on the artist Lady Gaga?
Yes, she is very eccentric and a good singer.
I think so too.  One of my favorite songs is Bad Romance.
I've heard about that song.  It's very risque.
Yes, it is.  She gets kidnapped and sold in that song.
That song actually went eleven-times platinum.
I like her song Born this way.
That song sounds interesting. What was it about.
She said it was her freedom song.  A lot of people criticized it.
Now I know. It was similar to Madonna's song Express Yourself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga is one of my favorite singers.
I think her music is a little too childish for me.
Not at all.  She is amazingly talented.
You think so?
Absolutely.  She sings, dances, writes, and plays her own instruments.
I didn't know that she did all of that.
She is a creative mastermind.  Her early stuff on youtube is so impressive.
I've never thought to watch it.
You should.  It will make you see her in a different light.
I think I'll do that.  Thanks for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's voice?
It is unique.
I agree. She sounds pretty different.
I am not a big fan of her songs. But, she has talent.
Did you listen to her last album?
No. I have heard a few songs from it though.
Do you like them?
Yes. They are pretty good.
Do you prefer her older music?
Yes. Just Dance is one of my favorite tunes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like BORN THIS WAY by Lady Gaga.
She referRed to herself as the ETERNAL MOTHER.
I think she means mother of the LITTLE MONSTERS.
She said there was another birth.
Her evil self was born.
Kind of like she was 2 people.
She said how can I protect something so pure.
And she said without evil.
Then the beat goes hard.
I'm glad she always dances in her videos.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's music?
Yes, actually I do.
I do too. The song Perfect Illusion is pretty good.
Yes, not bad.
You and I is pretty good too.
Yes, she has a lot of good songs.
Great performance too.
Did you see her sing at the SuperBowl?
Yes, I watched it.
That was an amazing performance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga's duets with Tony Bennett?
I think they're great!
I agree! She does a great job with the vocals.
I think she sounds like an old jazz singer.  I don't mean old, I mean vintage.
What do you think of her solos on that album?
Yeah, they are really good.
I think her singing is great.
Have you heard her play the piano?
I don't think so.
She's great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Gaga will be able to continue to reinvent herself?
I don't see why not.
Yeah, I guess.
Look at how long Madonna was able to stay relevant.
Good point, or look at Cher.
Still, I don't think she'll be able to top her success from a few years ago.
She really caught the Zeitgeist with Bad Romance.
That video was terrific.
How about Telephone and the whole prison theme.
It was awesome, and Beyonce poisoned that guy! wow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Lady Gaga's new album Joanne?
No I haven't, is it good?
Yeah, its good and very different then her previous stuff.
I am still listening to Art Pop, I really like that one.
I love applause off that album, I think its one of her best songs.
Me too, but her best stuf is still off The Fame and The Fame Monster..
I can't believe how many hits she had between them.  Bad Romance killed it.
The video for Bad Romance was fantastic.
I know, with those crazy razor glasses and the weird white costumes.
It totally fit her look and the song though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga's new song Perfect Illusion just came on the radio again on the way home.
I finally heard it!
Isn't it great?
I love the intro. It almost has an Eighties feel to me, but then it gets really hard.
Yeah. I like that it's a little poppy, but kind of angry.
The lyrics are perfection.
I really like the lines, "That's what it means to crush, now that I'm waking up..."
Yeah. It fits that moment when you realize the person you loved wasn't real.
I love that her lyrics feel so real and raw.
Yeah. It's a great, empowering, break up song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of Lady Gaga's song Born This Way?
Yes, she wrote it because she was inspired by the 90's music that empowered LGBT community and women.
All of her sounds seems eccentric but good.
Yes, her music is very powerful and sends a message with each song.
What other songs of hers do you like?
I like her song Paparazzi.
I heard the song comes in different chords.
I think it's in the E-chord but I also her it acoustically as well.
I only heard it on the piano.
She is a good pianist and play it in most of her songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the new remake of A Star is Born with Lady Gaga?
I did not know this! She's going to play the rising star?
Yes, with Bradley Cooper as the falling movie star.
They are going to look mighty fine together.
This a country western remake, so we'll see and hear a different Gaga.
I think she'll do great. She's always reinventing herself.
I saw her do A-Yo live on Saturday Night Live. She was fantastic.
I saw it too. It was kind of a rockin' country song, and she did such a great job.
As an actress, she will be using her given name, Stefani Germanotta. That'll be different too.
I hope it's a blockbuster. I can't wait to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Lady Gaga song from 2016?
I love Perfect Illusion, it has a great beat.  What is yours out of all of her songs?
Monster, I like singing along to it.
What do you think about her music videos?
They are always so creative and have fun dances.
Yeah, they are really artistic.  I was surprised to see Alexander Skarsgård in one too.
She does the artistic look with her outfits too.
I'm glad to see that she has moved on from meat dresses, that was taking it too far.
Yeah, her look has toned down lately and seems to be less about shock value.
It is understandable, she is getting older and wants to be taken seriously as an artist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Lady Gaga's new song?
Which one is that?
It's called The Cure. She sang it live at Coachella and it's just kind of blown up.
I haven't heard it.  I really liked A Million Reasons though from her album Joanne.
I feel like this may be her time to come back.  She came out with a bang in the late 2000s with The Fame but then she kind of fizzled out.
You didn't like Born This Way or Artpop?
No, none of the songs were very catchy.  The only catchy song was Born This Way.
I really liked Applause but you're right, there weren't as many stand alone hits.
I heard she did a jazz album at some point.  I'll have to check that out but I don't really like jazz.
I listened to one or two songs.  It was pretty good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Lady Gaga album?
Oh, definitely 'The Fame Monster'.
Does that have 'Bad Romance' on it?
Yes! In my opinion that's easily her best song.
I agree. What other singles are from that album?
'Alejandro' and 'Telephone', with Beyonce.
Oh yeah, and then Lady Gaga was on Beyonce's 'Video Phone'.
That's right! They were both great pop songs.
I'd say that's my favorite album too, then.
It's an easy decision. A great pop album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Name the top five Pop Divas of all time.
Diana Ross is number because she the eighties up!
Can you be a little more diverse?
Jennifer Lopez, she's stlll killing it.
You got your thinking cap today. Who else?
Mariah Carey, and she still slaying it too!
Yes she is, except for that New Year's Eve snafu. What about-
Selena Gomez? You think she's a Pop Diva?
Maybe, but I was thinking of someone more iconic.
Madonna, hands down along with Janet Jackson and Christi Al-....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what singing artist has the nickname "Mother Monster?
I sure do, it's Lady Gaga, she has many nicknames.
I only know of two the other one is Rabbit Teeth. That is a weird one.
Yes, she also has Gagaloo.
I wonder where they all come from.
Probably from her performances, I think she calls her fans little monsters.
Oh, that makes since for the Mother Monster nickname.
Did you know her favorite colors are black and lavender.
Kind of a mysterious, dark color with a beautiful soft one.
Fits her she is so diverse.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember when Lady Gaga sang that song from The Sound of Music?
Yes! That was Incredible!
I remember so many people on facebook being amazed that she had any singing ability at all.
Yeah. I do too. She's been a singer her whole life, though.
Yeah. Just because people have a quirky celebrity persona doesn't mean they are not talented.
Didn't she go to NYU?
I think so. She didn't go by Lady Gaga, though.
Do you know what her given name is?
I believe it is Stephanie, I'm not sure of her last name though.
I'll look it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen BORN THIS WAY?
Yes it is by Lady Gaga.
I liked the black unicorn.
It had the manifesto of MOTHER MONSTER.
She talked about aliens or something.
She talked about a new race.
And it was without judgement.
And also boundless freedom.
I guess she was the first in the new race.
It is a strange video.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Lady Gaga's real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta?
Wow, that's a mouthful!
Yeah, its a good long Italian Catholic name, that's for sure!
I wonder how she came up with Lady Gaga?
I actually know the answer to that one too.
No way!
Yup,her stage name was inspired by the Queen song, 'Radio Gaga'.
Wow, is there anything you don't know about Lady Gaga?
Doubtful. I am truly her biggest fan.
I can see that.
XXXXXXXXXXX

How great was Lady Gaga's album, 'The Fame?'

Those were so great.  The album also featured "Paparazzi."
I remember her winning a bunch of awards for that album.
You're right about that.  She was nominated for multiple Grammys.
Did she win any of the Grammys that year?
She won the Grammy for Best Electronic Album and the Best Dance Recording.
For which song?
"Poker Face" of course!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's song called "Million Reasons"?
I love that song, as a matter of fact, I was listening to it in my car today.
I like when she hits the really high notes.
Yes, she has a really good voice. Lady Gaga and Sia are my favorite singers.
Let's listen to one of her songs now. I can pull it up on my phone.
That sounds great!
Let's sing along with Lady Gaga.
Okay, but I really don't have a good voice.
Don't worry, when I go high, you go low.
Okay, let's make Lady Gaga proud!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's music?
She is not my favorite, but I like some of her songs.
Lady Gaga's music is mostly pop rock music.
Yes, Just Dance is used in a lot of bars and dance places.
Her last album Joanne was released in 2016.
Was it nominated for any award?
Yes, it was for  GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music Artist.
That's pretty cool. What songs are on it?
Diamond Heart and Joanne are my favorites on it.
I will have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Born This Way video?
You know, I don't really know if I like it.
I loved it! It was crazy to see her dancing that well.
I'll give you that, but I guess I just don't like the song.
Don't tell me you're one of the ones who thinks it sounds like Madonna.
Come on! It totally sounds like Madonna.
Yeah, but Lady GaGa is clearly inspired by Madonna. I don't think that's a bad thing.
I agree, but she should do something new with it.
I think she is.
I think she could do a lot more with all her talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Gaga's outfits?
I find that her outfits are always super creative and very provocative.
Do you like Gaga's newer music or older music?
Older music is my favorite and is very fresh.  What songs do you like?
I really like the songs poker face, bad romance and telephone.
Those are some of my favorites also.  Did you know she is classically trained?
I did not but I can believe it with her range.  What do you think of her stage presence?
She is fearless up there and has proven to try any daring feat.
Would you go see her in concert?
I would love to see her concerts no matter what they cost.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like listening to Lady Gaga?

How did you like Lady Gagas song 'The Cure'?
It was okay, but I am not the biggest fan of her.
Why is that?
She is a good singer, but she does a lot of extra stuff outside of music.
What do you mean by extra stuff?
She makes a lot of noise outside of making music, I wish she would stay professional and just sing.
I liked her personality and it shows independence.
Maybe you are right about that.
Her music is great and you can't deny that.

Did you see Lady Gaga's oscar performance?
Which one?
The one where she was introduced by Joe Biden.
Oh, was that the one with the survivors of sexual assault?
Yes!
That was really moving.
I agree. Do you remember which song she sung?
I think it was called "til it happens to you".
It's so amazing that she has made herself an advocate for sexual assult.
I agree. It is inspirational.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So Lady Gaga is a great pianist.
She does seem to have many talents.
I like her singing too but only sometimes.
What do you mean?
Sometimes she has a more manly voice. It's deeper.
Oh, I see. Yes, that is true.
Like the voice she uses on Poker Face is deeper.
Right, and she sings better on You and I.
Yes, exactly.
I prefer the You and I voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga? Her new music is definitely interesting.
Yeah she's super good, my favorite song on her new album is Joanne.
Really? I thought that one was okay. I kinda like her older stuff better.
Yeah, it feels like she is taking a new direction with her recent music. I still like it though.
She definitely had some crazy outfits way back when.
I know! The meat dress was a bit strange to me.
She has such great live performances though.
I would love to go to one of her concerts.
I hear she treats her fans with respect too.
That's great to see in a big artist like her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
And what about Lady Gaga? You like her?
Oh yeah. Love her. Such an amazing singer, to start with.
Oh yeah. And an amazing performer as well. She looks like the real thing you know. Real intense.
She does. It's funny how someone who is all about costumes and disguises can feel so authentic at the same time.
It is, really. But I feel like a lot of her songs are clearly about her, and the way she lives her life.
Yes. With all the confusion, hubris and craziness it involves.
Really. And she does make it real - the power trips, the crazy partying and the loneliness, and the weird way to interact with people that it all generates.
She's good at craziness. Really good at showing it too. Her videos are something else.
They're so incredible! I love the video for Applause. It's mesmerizing.
I know! It's insane and it's fascinating - and beautiful!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
It was fun!
I agree!
What was she wearing?
I don tknow but it looked neat!
Not my style
Really?
Yea it's gaga but I could never wear it!
I could
you're a guy!...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi are you listening to Lady Gaga?
Yes I am listening to Poker face!
I love that song, it makes me want to get up and dance.
I know me too! I like a lot of her songs.
Which is your favorite?
I would say You and I.
I like when it happens to you.
Oh that is a unconvential song by lady Gaga but a good one.
I know! It earned a oscar.
Lady gaga has oscars, grammys and a emmy. She is the total package.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Lady Gaga's last album?
I thought it was very different than her previous work.
Well that's pretty vague. Was it different in a good way or a bad way?
I like that she is not afraid to branch out and try something new, but I don't like her as a country artist.
I agree. I think she has a fantastic voice though.
She's a great singer, but I don't think her voice works for country music.
She's really good at jazz though. Her duet album with Tony Bennett was something different and it was pretty good.
What was your favorite song on that album?
I really liked Cheek to Cheek. How about you?
I think Lush Life was the best song. I'm not big on jazz, but that song is very moving.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite lady gaga video?
Telephone because it was her and beyonce together. Not sure it gets better.
I liked that video a lot. I think it even won an award at some point.
I know that Gaga wrote the song for Britney Spears originally.
Woah, I had not clue. How did she end up doing it then?
I don't know exactly but so glad it was her and not britney.
Nothing against spears , but I am so glad it was gaga and beyonce in the end.
Ya, i don't think britney would have been right for it.
Maybe we are just biased, I know I prefer Gaga in general.
I like britney a lot but feel Gaga is more talented especially vocally over britney.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you been to she  TASHA COBBS IN live?
NO, I HEARD OF HER ,DO SHE SING GOSPEL  SONG?
YES SHE SING GOSPEL SONGS. SHE IS SO GOOD.

MATTER FACT SHE WILL BE LIVE A GAIN .
IS YOU PLANNING TO GO TO SEE HER THIS TIME?
yes ,how will you like going with me the next time?
thanks i will love going with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How tall is lady gaga?
She is only 5'1''. Very short.
I thought she looked short but hard when she is often wearing crazy heels.
Alejandro is my favorite song, what about you?
Bad romance or poker face.
Bad romance was on the album fame monster with Alejandro.
Ya that was an awesome album.
I don't think she has had a bad one ever!
Probably very true. each seems to have at least a few mega hits.
Exactly not a bad one... yet anyways.. and doubtful to be one in the future either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into Lady Gaga's music?
Yes sometimes.
What songs have you heard recently?
I heard Beautiful, Dirty, Rich.
I like that song but it is kind of catty in my opinion.
Yeah I can always imagine that being the theme to mean girls or something.
Very true.
I like the song Telephone.
That song will never get old.
Totally agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
DO YOU LIKE MARVIN SAPP SONGS?

THAT SOUND GOOD TO ME,I WILL LOVE TO SEE HIM IN  LIVE.
MAY BE WE CAN GET TOGETHER AND GO TOGETHER.
THAT WILL BE GOOD,I WILL LOVE THAT JUST LET ME NO, THANKS
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is better: Katy Perry or Lady Gaga?
Lady Gaga, for sure.
Why is that?
Well, Lady Gaga is not afraid to be herself and she knows how to sing really well.
I agree. Personally, I think Artpop was a flop, but I still listened to a few of the songs from there.
There weren't good ones on that album, but her other albums were amazing.
Born This Way was the best song she's made.
I think Poker Face was good, but that might just be because I like to gamble.
True. Does she have new music coming out?
I'm not sure! She might, but she hasn't promoted it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really dislike pop music
Do you even listen to it
No because i dislike it
So youve never even given it a try
Nope not once
Thats ignorant
Well its my opinion
Give lady gagas music a try i promise its good
If you insist
Trust me
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga?
I love Lady Gaga! What's your favorite song?
Definitely "Just Dance." What's yours?
I'd say "Poker Face."
I like her older stuff.
Yeah, me too.
Have you ever seen her in concert?
No, but I'd like to!
So would I. I really like her style. I bet it would be a great show.
Totally! For sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard that line "show me you teeth" from Lady Gaga?
Yes a drunk guy at a bar said it to me over and over one night.
Ha! What do you think of applause?
I love it because my girlfriend embodies that song
She has that one song about cheating too
Yeah my girlfriend cheated on me one night while i was listening to that
When lady gaga first came out what did you think of her?
I loved poker face. It didn't sound like any other song at the time.
I liked when she wore that meat dress.
Oh me too. It was a far cry from Tony Bennett times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what is sad
What is sad?
That Lady Gaga has so many unappreciated songs
What ever do you mean
Well i mean her most popular ones are not her best
Is that not true for every artist
Not really i see many who have good work popular
But it is not a bad thing in itself
Why not
because it means its nuanced
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wasn't she wearing her meat outfit in video for Poker Face?
I don't think so.
So when did she wear that?
It was at some awards show, probably the Emmy awards.
Oh.  Poker Face would have been an appropriate song to wear it.
I'm afraid to ask, but why do you think that?
Well, in poker, you need to act confident and defiant.
I'm not following.
If you were wearing meat, everybody would know you're not afraid to bluff, right?
That's some twisted logic if you ask me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite music artist?
I really like Lady Gaga.
Yes! She is very unique.
I have to agree.  She always gets people talking.
What is your favorite song by her?
I really enjoy listening to "Bad Romance."
Me too.  It makes me just want to sing along and turn the volume up.
I like to turn the volume up on her songs especially in the car.
How about when she went to the award show in the egg thing?
I remember that! It was very interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Lady Gaga's concert last night?
It was better than I thought it would be. I must admit that I had some reservations before going to the concert.
What do you mean? You never told me you had any reservations!
Well, you know how theatrical she can be.
That is true which is why I knew she would give a great concert!
I figured the concert would be more of a production rather than her singing.
I know what you mean. Lady Gaga is quite a character.
Well, after going to her concert, I can say that I love everything about her character!
I agree. I think her character makes her unique from other musical artists.
Especially with the lack of talent from most musical artists today!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the video for Lady Gaga's The Cure?
I haven't. Where can I watch it?
It's on Youtube.
What else should I watch of hers?
Million Reasons is a great video
I like watching live concerts.
Oh there is a video of her doing Bad Romance in Sydney
Is it any good?
Oh it's amazing.
I'll watch that after Applause.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What type of lady gaga song do you like the most?
what do you mean?
the ballads or the anthems?
would you say born this way and judas are anthems?
they're anthems to me...but born this way is more of an anthem.
i like her big thematic songs.
I like her ballads more.
like what?
like dope, speechless and million reasons.
those songs are so good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga has one of the most underrated voices in pop music.
Underrated?? She's always winning so many awards!
Yes, but I think she wins them because of her performances, videos, and presentation. Not specifically for her voice.
Well she excels and performing. Please explain, because I don't understand where you;re coming from
Take for example Madonna. Madonna is a legend, but her voice itself isn't all that great
And you're saying Lady Gaga is similar?
No, I'm saying Lady Gaga is far better. Her voice is a lot more amazing that the average pop star
Oh I see. Yes I saw her singing a capella once in a viral video in a mall.
I saw that too! She sounded incredible!
She is one of my favorite artistes out today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What song do you like the most of Lady Gaga?
Just Dance or Poker Face.
So you like her early stuff.
I also like her first songs.
Some of her outfits are something like that meat outfit.
That was hilarious. I don't think I could walk around in a meat outfit.
I also like Bad Romance do you like that one?
Yes I like that one too.
Paparazzi was ok also.
I didn't like that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Lady Gaga really a woman?
I believe so.
Did you enjoy Lady Gaga's Half-time show?
Yes, It was great!
Has Lady Gaga had any new music out lately.
Not that I know of, earlier this year she had a few new songs.
Was Bad romance on the Billboard Top 100?
Yes, it was.
Do you like Lady Gaga's music?
Yes, she is great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Lady GAGA album?
I loved the Born this Way album.  It had so many great hits on it.
Which Lady GAGA video is your favorite?
The Telephone video was great.  It was like a mini-movie.
Do you prefer the older Lady GAGA music or the more recent singles?
I much prefer the older singles like Poker Face and Paparazzi.  They had a more upbeat feel.
Which Lady GAGA tour was your favorite?
The Monster Ball Tour was amazing.  She performed all her greatest hits and she was very inspiring.
How do you think the music in the upcoming movie A Star is Born will compare to her traditonal work?
I think Lady GAGA will do an amazing job in the movie.  I'm really looking forward to how she will recreate the role and music for the origianl film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is your favorite Gaga song?
I think Just Dance, It was like an anthem for me for a while.
It does make you want to move.
I like that about her music a lot, so energetic .
I like the telephone song a lot.
That is a great one great video too.
Gaga is such a creative genius.
I feel she has really done well for herself.
Ya  she even dropped out of school to pursue her dreams, I admire her dedication.
Me too. She does work very hard and has the talent to back it all up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Lady Gaga's new album?
Yeah, Joanne? What do you think of it?
It's certainly different than her usual style.
Yeah, she's really breaking away from what she established.
I mean, it's nice to hear her branch out from pop.
True. Like her performance of Somwhere Over the Rainbow.
Yeah, now, THAT was an impressive expose.
For sure! She doesn't even need autotune; I don't see why they use it all the time on her albums.
Well, it's less about correcting her voice, and more about creating an effect.
Okay, yeah, I can see that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which song was your favorite that Lady Gaga performed during the Superbowl Half time show?
Her performance of "Million Reasons" was outstanding.  A real show stopper.
I really enjoyed Edge of Glory.
Yes, that was a great one, too.  As well as "Bad Romance and Poker Face."
What artists has Lady Gaga written songs for?
She's written for big artists such as The Pussycat Dolls and Britney Spears just to name a couple.
What was Lady Gaga's first number one song?
Her number one song was Just Dance in 2008.  It definitely made you want to dance.
Does Lady Gaga's name have anything to do with her passion for music?
Yes!  She took her stage name from a Queen song.  I believe it was called "Radio Ga Ga".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Do you have any favorite Lady Gaga songs?
Hmmm favorite let me think.
Sure.
I like the new one that's out now.
What's it called?
I think it's called the cure.
I don't know if I've heard that one.
It's all over the radio.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just heard Lady Gaga's song The Cure on the radio!
Did you like it?  I am still a little on the fence about it.
I loved it!  Although I have to admit I had no idea it was her at first.
Yeah, her new sound showcases her voice a lot more.
I do like her more soulful sound, I'm glad she is trying something a little more deep.
I kind of miss her old stuff.  Born This Way was still pretty deep but a little more upbeat.
I guess that's true.  But I still like her slower stuff too.
I am kind of glad that she has toned down her crazy antics though and is focused more on her voice.
I disagree!  I miss her in meat dresses and grand entrances.
The days of Bad Romance were pretty entertaining.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Lady Gaga's new album?!
I like it, it's definitely way different than her earlier album.
I agree that it's different, this one sounds like she grew up a little bit.
It has a lot of country influences in it.
It sure does, that's probably why I'm not a huge fan of it. I'm not a huge country fan.
Really?? I prefer her new sound actually.
Not me. I love her older albums, Bad Romance and Born This Way is too good.
I like those songs as well, her dance stuff is very catchy.
My favorite aspect of Lady Gaga is her music videos actually.
I totally agree with that one hundred percent, she's a visionary when it comes to that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
how long have you been a fan of Lady Gaga?
Oh since she first came out years ago, I heard her music in Montreal before the states.
Oh really? What's your favorite song?
My favorite is still Just Dance,  nothing like the original. You?
Actually I agree about the original CD but I prefer Poker Face.
Do you think she is still as popular?
I wish! I think once she did the Tony Bennett duo things went downhill!
oh I totally agree, I feel like Katy Perry did a nice job taking over
Totally agree, I loved Gagas outfits at every show but she hasn't really done that, what u think?
She is still my favorite and I can't wait for her new CD this year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you think gagas songs are about herself?
some of them.
a lot are kinda soaked in metaphors though.
like judas. who knows what its really about.
betrayal i suppose. i doubt its really about jesus.
didnt the music video have her kissing with judas?
no, i dont think so. judas was hot though.
i should watch it again.
it is not essential.
i'm gonna listen to bad romance then
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what are your thoughts on Lady Gaga?
I think she's a pretender.
What do you mean by that?
She just tries to copy what Madonna did in the 1980's.
I can see what you mean.
She just acts weird and dresses up to get attention and sell albums.
Well isn't that what every pop artist does?
I think some of them have musical merit.
You are pretty tough on her.
She's just a reproduction of all the gimmicks that have come before.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Lady Gaga on the VMA's in 2009?
Yes! Where she did Paparazzi?
Yes! It was amazing. What did you think about the end?
Where she started bleeding? That was incredible.
I know. You could hear the audience gasp audibly when that happened.
What other songs do you like?
I really like Perfect Illusion. You?
I like Joanne. Have you heard all of her new album?
I just bought it.
It's really different from her other stuff. I like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Lady Gaga?
She's weird, but her music is good.
How did she get started?
I guess she was a song writer. Akon, however, helped her get started as a singer.
Wow, that's an interesting path to stardom.
I agree, but her music talent is undeniable. So, it was pretty certain she would make it.
What's the key to her success as a musician?
I think it's her innovation. She just keeps evolving.
Yes, there's a bit change from Poker Face to Perfect Illusion.
I agree. And, I would expert her music to continue to evolve. She always seems to be a leader in the music industry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
The cure is really good
Really? I find it to be boring
Why is that?
I just prefer her dance tracks that's all
What song is your favorite then?
I love Poker Face!
It's a good song, but isn't it overrated
I don't think so, I just think a lot of people like it because its so good
I can't argue with that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Lady Gaga's latest? I can't get enough.
I can't say that I have, sport. Tell me all about it.
It's called "Boys, Boys, Boys" and it's the best. I'll sing it if you want.
I have to be honest, I have no idea who she is. Is she that girl who wore the meat dress?
Oh yes, exactly. And my second favorite is "Disco Heaven" and my third favorite is "Don't Speak" but I think that might be someone else.
Hmmm. I'll wiki it. You are correct, it is someone else. Hey, you're a little late; those were released like 9 years ago.
But I just bought them today so they're new to me.
Can't argue with that logic. So something like "The Cure" from this year isn't new?
I haven't bought it yet. All me all the time, that's how I live.
I fear for the future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga's music videos are such art.
I know, it's crazy how she can come up with these ideas.
No one does it like her.
The video for Paparazzi was pure perfection.
I loved the stuff she did with Beyonce.
Yes!  Video Phone and Telephone were legendary videos!
We're going to look back on all of her stuff and compare her to Micheal Jackson.  She's that great!
She's way better than Madonna, that's for sure.
And Mariah Carey.  Gaga is in a league of her own.
I'm forever a fan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite type of music you listen to?
I like pop music quite a bit.
So, Lady Gaga is one of your favorites?
Yes, she is a superstar, and has many awards in music.
What is your favorite album of hers?
I liked Artpop quite a bit that she produced in 2013 I believe.
I think that one did win world top album award.
Gypsy, Do What You Want are my two favorite songs on the album.
I liked Aura on that album as well.
She is a fantastic artist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some of the songs that Lady Gaga sings?
The Cure, Just Dance, Bad Romance, Telephone, Applause, way too many to list.
Do you like her music?
yes, Born this way is probably my favorite. I can really relate to it.
I've seen her on a couple of interviews, and thought she was way out there.
Are you talking about the "meat suit"?
among other things, but she does have a good sound
Yes she does.
Have you heard Perfect Illusion?
Not yet. Will look for it when I head to the music store later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I always forget how much I love old Lady GAGA songs!
Me too!
It's like impossible not to dance to them!
I know what you mean, I love poker face.
Me too, and Telephone.
Oh, I forgot about that one!
Yeah, her and beyonce are amazing.
Yeah, I love the music video to that one too.
Yes, I love the style and the story!
Me too, it's one of my favorite music videos.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch Lady Gaga at the Superbowl?
Yes!  It was can't miss at my house!
I know, my parents didn't understand it but I loved it!
Yeah, I think the message was lost on the older generation.
She looked really great, too.
Yeah, I heard people thought she looked fat.
Are you kidding me?  I'd die to have her body!
I know, they definitely have a warped sense of reality.
She looked great, there was a point where she looked too thin.
I'm glad she looks the way she does.  I love her!
XXXXXXXXXXX
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE SING  CHARLES JOHNSON ?
NO,WHAT KIND OF SONG DO HE SING?
GOSPEL SONG AND HE IS SO GOOD YOU SHOULD HEAR HIM.
WHAT IS ONE OF HIS BEST SONG THAT YOU LOVE?
JESUS WITH ME IS SO GOOD PEOPLES STAND ALL THE WAY THROW THE SONG.

THANKS, I WILL BE WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you know angel down?
its from joanne?
yup, her newest album.
that song is stripped and beautiful.
it speaks on injustices and pain of losing someone.
yup, gaga seems like such a good person.
she sounds like she actually cares.
"i'd rather save an angel down"
everything seems to be getting worse. so many murders.
at least gaga cares
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like how gaga changes her look almost every album
I know its odd
Odd is not the word i would use
What word would you use
Brilliant myself
You like it
Of course who would not
I am indifferent
That is not dislike though
I guess
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga was on Saturday Night Live last night. Did you see it?
Yes, and I loved it.
I know! A-yo is so fun and catchy!
Yeah! But it has a more stripped-down feel to it.
I heard the new album was going to be like that.
I loved the second one, Million Reasons.
I know. The lyrics just really resonated with me.
Me too. It perfectly captured the feelings I had when I went through my last breakup.
Her songwriting is so raw like that.
I can't wait to hear the whole album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Lady Gaga album?
I know it's new, but I love Joanne.
Why is that?
She still maintains her awesome vocal prowess, but has stepped back a bit with the crazy.
Yeah, she's an actual person now.
What do you mean? That's not nice.
Before she was an image, or an act. Now she's a person.
Sort of. But yeah, this album is very personal, very stripped-down.
Is "The cure" on it?
No, that's an independent song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Born This Way is a great album.
Yes. Did you know it was Lady Gaga's second studio album?
No, I did not.
It might be her best one.
What is your favorite track?
Americano
Cool. I like Marry the Night.
Each song is very unique
Yes. It has a lot of variety.
Electric Chapel is a great song on there too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like what Gaga did at the Super Bowl?
I think she picked out great songs to perform.
Bad Romance was a little stale.
I mean its older but people like that.
She was able to mix in the old and the new
I think performing slower songs would be a determent to her.
I dont think thats accurate at all
Why not?
You need to slow down the pace sometimes
I guess it could make a bigger audience happy
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
Awwweeeeeesssoooommmmmeeeee!

She is my favorite!
Mine too!
We should go see her

Yes, it was an amazing performance of "God Bless America".
XXXXXXXXXXX
I used to really like Lady Gaga, but her music has been different lately.
I think you're right. She's just not the same as she was when she first became famous.
Do you remember Poker Face? It was one of my favorite songs.
Yes, it had such a good beat! It was really similar to Bad Romance.
That was a good one too, but those two sounded almost like the same song to me.
I used to blast the radio and sing along with those songs when I was in high school.
Yeah, her songs just aren't the same anymore.
I don't think they're bad though.
I don't either.
We should look up her newest song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I think her first single, Just Dance, is probably her best song.
I agree, her best music is probably her earliest songs.
Definitely, her later music starts to get a little strange.
I once saw her infamous meat dress at the rock and roll hall of fame.
That must have been interesting
It was, I was shocked by how small it was.
Really?  I never realized Lady Gaga was very thin.
Neither did I.
I look forward to the music she creates in the future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get Lady Gaga's newest album?
Yes, I got the digital download. What did you think?
It's okay.  I really thought her Bad Romance album was much better.
Yeah, Bad Romance was definitely the best.  Alejandro has to be my favorite song ever.  What's yours?
I love Alejandro. I especially like the video.  The storyline is so creative.
Yes, Lady Gaga really is an allover artist.  Her videos are so poetic.
What is your favorite video?
I really like the Poker Face video.
Why is that your favorite?
The dogs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
DID YOU SAW TASH COBBS LIVE SHOW ?

YES, WHAT ABOUT YOU DID YOU STAY ALL THE WAY TO THE END?
NO I HAD TO LEAVE JUST BE FORE IT END BUT SHE WAS ON HER LAST SONG.
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVOR SONG SHE SING?
IT WAS BREAK EVERY CHAIN ,THAT JUST ONE.
THAT IS ONE OF MY FAVOR SONG TOO.
HOW WILL YOU LIKE TO GET TOGETHER NEXT TIME WHEN SHE IN TIME?
I WILL TO GO WITH YOU NEXT TIME, THANKS
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the Lady Gaga and Tony Bennet duo album?
I think it was great for her career
Yeah I think she gained fans through it
I think she did it on purpose.
To gain a bigger audience
That was my exact reasoning
Her vocals were so good on the album though
I would have loved to see a Bad Romance re-do with both of them
I would be scared to hear him sing that.
Yeah it would be slowed down for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how did you hear about Lady Gaga's most recent album?
Can you jog my memory? What was the name?
Sure. It was called Joanne.
Oh now I remember it came out in 2016 I think I have only heard the two singles released from that album.
Oh yes I loved those singles "Perfect Illusion" and "Million Reasons"
I first heard "Perfect Illusion" on this show she played a role in called American Horror Story. But never considered buying the full album.
I am familiar with that show. I actually purchased the single on Itunes prior to buying the album
Wow can you tell me what the album focuses on and the sound?
I definitely think it is a softer side to Lady Gaga that focuses more on family she dedicated it to her Aunt that had passed away.
Wow that is a new turn for her music which is usually rather upbeat and focused on a pop sound.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Lady Gaga's latest album?
No, I kind of tuned out after "Born This Way".
Some of the new stuff is pretty good, particularly "Million Reasons".
That sounds familiar - I might have heard that one before.
Lady Gaga sang it at the Super Bowl, and it did pretty good on the charts after that.
That's right, I remember seeing that performance.
That said, I'm still waiting for the dance-oriented, "weirdo" version of Gaga to return.
It's been several years since "Just Dance", "Paparazzi", and "Bad Romance".
I know, and since then she's dueted with Tony Bennett and has become almost too "normal".
I agree, I think her songwriting is strong enough to stand on its own but I gravitate more to songs that aren't really straightforward.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know if Lady Gaga has a new album coming out soon?
I haven't heard anything about it, but I wish that she would release something soon. She's one of my favorites.
Her songs are so catchy, but heartfelt. I love hearing them when I go to the club.
I know! "Bad Romance" was my favorite when it first came out.
I think she's different from the other pop divas, because her style is so out-there at times.
Yeah, she definitely pushes the limits of what you can do in pop culture.
What was that song she did with Beyonce?
Oh! You mean "Telephone"?
That's the one! That song was awesome.
It sure was! Man, I hope she releases a new album soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga's music completely illustrates the sad state of American pop music today.
Why's that?
Have you ever heard of Stefani Germanotta?
No.  Who's that?
That's Lady Gaga's real name.
Really?
Yes, she studied music academically in New York and was working professionally as a pianist and singer before she was even old enough to drive.
Wow.
But, being talented wasn't good enough for her to become a famous singer.  She had to put on meat dresses and masks and sing like a robot for anyone to take her seriously.
You're right.  American pop music is pretty sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Lady Gaga songs do you like?
I like Perfect Illusion.
Is that from the new album.
Yeah it is. I just heard it and I thought it was great.
I will have to check that out.
I also like You and I.
That is old but still good.
What do you think about Marry the Night.
I always thought that was a good song.
Yeah me too, and it is underrated.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you know Lady Gaga?
Well no not personally.
I mean do you know her music.
Yeah sure.
Do you have a favorite song of hers?
I like bad romance.
That is a good track.
That is pretty much the only one I know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you like most about Lady Gaga?
I like that she speaks up for what she believes in.
Yes, you can hear that in a lot of her songs.
Which ones do you think have the most powerful messages?
Born This Way is very beautiful.
Yeah, she displays lots of love in that song.
Have you ever heard about the song she did that donated money to sexual abuse victims?
I haven't heard of that. What song is it?
Yeah, it called "Til it Happens to You".
I'll have to look that up on Youtube.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just heard the best redo of Lady Gaga's Romance!
A redo of her song?
You know a parody, but it is about the history of the French Revolution! It's on YouTube.
How did they incorporate the French revolution?
They talked about the motto "Liberté égalité fraternité"
I just watched it and it's very catchy!
It includes all the main characters, Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, Napoleon.
Lady Gaga's music and Lyrics pattern was used to great effect for this song.
I won't be able to hear Lady Gaga sing this now with out thinking about the French Revolution.
La la liberte! Eh Eh Egalite, fra fra Fraternite!  A Revolution!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite lady gaga song?
I actually like one of her very first songs called "Just Dance"
I don't really remember that one.
It was one of the ones she released before she became very famous and more controversial.
She does have very unique songs and videos.
Yes she does and very eccentric taste in fashion too.
I do not think I have heard any new songs from her in a long time.
You're right, it seems like she has kind of disappeared for awhile.
For awhile there she was all anyone could talk about.
Maybe she is on tour in another country.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your all-time favorite Lady Gaga song?
I absolutely love the cure!
What do you like about that song specifically?
I find the message behing the song powerful.
I really love her voice in the cure song. It is soft at times and then powerful at other times.
That's awesome! I find Lady Gaga to be a powerful sign in society through music and her image overall.
What did you think about when she dressed up as a piece of meat?
That was completeley wild! A bit funny as long as you have a sense of humor.
Is there any other songs that you really enjoy from Lady Gaga?
I really enjoy Million Reasons.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the name of Lady Gaga's last album?
It is Joanne, it was her fifth studio album.
That's right. I just recall she has pink hat on the cover.
Yes, I love that hat. What track on it do you like most?
Million Reasons, it is so moving and emotional.
I think that is my favorite single from this album as well.
The lyrics slightly reminded me of that old tracy chapman song, Give me one reason to stay here.
That is a similar message.
I wonder if she realized the similarity or is totally unaware?
Who knows it could be a subconscious thing. Artist constantly influence each other.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to Lady Gaga?
I listen to them when they come on the radio.
What is your favorite song?
I really like "Alejandro." What's your favorite?
I like "Bad Romance" and "Just dance."
Ah, that was her very first song.
Do you like her new stuff?
I'm not a huge fan of those. I prefer the older songs.
Did you know she can play the piano really well?
Yes, she's a talented musician, but I've heard you have to see her live for her to really showcase it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever listened to Lady Gaga?
Of course, she is one of my favorites. Do you have a favorite song by her?
One of my favorites is Born this way because of the meaning of the song. What is your favorite song?
My favorite is Million Reasons I just like the song for so many reasons. I always have it on repeat.
Did you know she is on tour this year?
Yeah she's doing a world tour I heard it was pretty awesome.
She's always put on a great show she's such a great performer.
I wish I could afford to see her one day.
Her tickets are real expensive but that's because of the venues and cost of her stage props.
I understand that hopefully one day I can go enjoy a show in person.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
That's a tough call! New or older Lady Gaga?
How about each?
Well my favorite newer song is Million Reasons!
Did you see her perform it at the Victoria Secret fashion show?
Yes, it was amazing!
What is your favorite older song of hers?
I think I'd have to pick Just Dance. What about you?
I really like that song too! Either that or Poker Face.
Don't forget about the great song Bad Romance!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about Lady Gag?
Do you mean her clothes or her music?
Her music!
Oh, I love her music. I think she's super talented.
I totally agree. Do you feel differently about her clothing?
I just think it's too much. I don't think she needs all that costuming.
I think it's an expression of who she is.
Her music does that on it's own! Have you heard any of her acoustic stuff?
I don't think I have.
I love it. You should check out her playing piano and singing "Marry the Night".
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was reading about Lady Gaga and she had a band named," Stefani Germanotta Band with some friends from NYU.
That is a crazy name for a band.
The band started out playing gigs in New York on the lower east side.
I think it would be fun being in a band. I do not have any musical talent.
I don't either but I love to sing along as long as I am by myself.
Is she from Austria or Europe?
No, she is an American.
Really, I did not know that.
I'll bet you didn't know she went to a Catholic school but she says the New York underground is where she found herself.
Well, I am glad she did because she has some really great songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a lady Gaga fan?
Yes I am, She is a hell of a singer.

"Just Dance" is one of my all time favorties
I like that also.  I can't wait for her next album.

Lady Gaga is one of the best artist since Madonna.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what did you think about her meat dress?
well, i thought it was an interesting design but a little distasteful.
what do you mean by that?
well it's a dress made entirely out of meat. a lot of animals were killed for that
do you think lady gaga is against animals?
well she has done a few things that make me think that, specifically the meat dress though.
do you think she's likely to do that again in the future?

So, Lady Gaga. What do you think of her?
She tries wayyyy too hard. She's always wearing some stupid costume to get attention and stay relevant.
No, no, I'm talking about her music dude.
I mean... I guess her music is okay? Most of it's just generic pop.
Then why do people keep saying she's groundbreaking and different?
Because she dresses in bizarre costumes and says weird stuff all the time.
Yeah but you have to admit. She has talent. At least her stuff sounds good.
Yeah, that's true. Her better songs tend to be the ones people aren't familiar with.
Well that's true with any artist.
Sure, sure. But I just wish she'd focus more on being weird and different with her music instead of doing that with her visual style.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Lady Gaga plays several different instruments?
I know she plays the piano.
She also plays  an acoustic guitar and the drums.
Wow, she is really talented does she play anything else?

i was scared the whole album would be like that.
it was a big strong song though.
it reminded me too much of artpop.
artpop was grand but wasn't catchy enough.
that was what i got from perfect illusion
i get what you mean.
the chorus was not as strong either
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your opinion on Lady Gaga Fashion sense?
I can say she is very imaginary, she is bold, and her hair dues be so different.
I loved her outfits in her music video Poker face with Beyonce her collaboration with other artists is dope.
Lady Gaga kinda scared me though when she did the series American Horror Story, she was so dark and evil. Really good actress as well as singer! Captured the character well!
Do you think she is performing soon?
Well if I'm  not mistaken , she will be performing in Citifield, New York, N.Y. on August 28, 29, 2017.

Totally, and the nod toward Thelma and Louise towards the end of the video is great.
Beyonce and Lady Gaga make such a great duo.
They are both so talented.
Oh, there's no doubt. Lady Gaga actually co-wrote the script for the Telephone music video.
Wow, I had no idea. She's so creative.
She helps write a lot of her songs, too.
I think that that's so nice. It seems a lot of singers don't write their own songs these days.
I totally agree. I actually read somewhere that Lady Gaga wrote Telephone for Britney Spears.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, I have to admit that I am really surprised that Lady Gaga can actually sing.
I know what you mean. I thought she was just a blonde publicity stunt.
I heard Bad Romance and it was good.
My favorite is The Edge of Glory.
That one is really really good too!  Did you see her on that awards show singing Julie Andrews songs?
I did!  I was really impressed!
I couldn't believe she had the talent! She also sings with Tony Bennett, right?
She does and she is very good!
I guess the girl has some vocal range after all!
It'll be interesting to see what songs she comes out with over the years!
XXXXXXXXXXX

No way... But then I can believe it, she's seriously an amazing artist.
Yeah but you know a lot of people judge her for her fashion choices.
Like when she wore that dress made of meat? I have to admit, that was a bit weird.
Artists sometimes do things that a lot of normal people wouldn't. That's just how show business works.
I think it has more to do with her personality, but I guess you're right.
Either way, I think we can agree that Lady Gaga has made some excellent music.
Too true. I really hope that she comes out with another song like Perfect Illusion soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite type of music you listen to?
I like Lady Gaga's music, hers is fantastic.
What are your favorite songs?
Poker Face is my favorite song, but I like Just Dance as well.
Those are great songs of hers. Joanne is her latest album from 2016.
Yes, there are a few songs I enjoy on that one as well.
Joanne is your favorite one on it?
Actually, I enjoyed Diamond Heart and Angel Down.
I liked Dancin in Circes the best!
Yes that was a great one too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you know eh, eh by gaga?
what album is that from?
fame monster. the other name is nothing else i can say.
dude, her " cherry cherry boom boom" beginning is so cute
she chose a more cutesy vocal style in that song.
it's one of my favorites,
it has this synth thing going on and the chorus is nice.
doesn't have the best lyrics though.
it doesnt matter.
melodies over lyrics
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard the Singles album by Lady Gaga?
No, I have not. What was it like?
It was produced in 2010, and it was one of her first records.
What are some of the songs on it?
Bad Romance, Poker Face, and Alejandro are some of the songs on it I love.
Those are good, I love Poker Face too.
The you tube video had so many views it wasn't even funny.
Yes she is very popular.
Telephone is on there too, do you like that one?
Yes, its a great song.
XXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hey.
Do you know about Lady Gaga?
Only a little bit.
Not really a big fan of hers?
No I wouldn't call myself a fan, but I know a few of her more popular songs.
Bad Romance is a really  big one from her.

It still does, I hear it from time to time on the radio.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about 'Joanne?'
Lady Gaga's latest album?  I love it so much.
Me too.  What is your favorite song on it?
"A-Yo" is just so much fun.  How about you?
"Perfect Illusion" was my favorite part of the album.
That's a great one too.
Yea.  I loved how stripped-down and modest the album was.
Exactly.  Almost soft-rock.
She's proven with her album that she has such range as an artist.
And most importantly, that she is still relevant.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga's new music?
It's good but it's nothing like her old stuff. I really liked her older songs better.
She is such an incredible singer. What's your favorite music video?
I love the music video with Beyonce of course!
That one was good, but my favorite was Bad Romance.
What did you think about her playing a guy in the You and I music video?
It was so awesome!
And she dressed in drag in her performance too once!
I love her. She is so brave.
She's incredible!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Lady Gaga live?
No!  But I've heard she puts on a great show.
I had tickets the last time she was here, but I couldn't go.  I had to work late.
Yeah, my sister went to see her.  She said it was an experience!
That is a good thing, right?
Yeah, she said she's a fan forever now because of how amazing it was.
I will definitely have to see her next time.
I want to go, too.  We should go together!
Sounds like a plan, now she just needs to come here.
That could be a long wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Lady Gaga song.
I love Alejandro. You?
My favorite is probably Bad Romance.
I went to one of her concerts last year it was amazing when she sang that.
No way that's cool! What does she call her fans again?
They are called her 'monsters'.
Haha that's cute I like that.
I hope they make a live concert movie for the theaters of Lady Gaga one day.
They did that for One Direction right?
Yes exactly like that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have loved lady Gaga ever since she first came out
Me too. She has such a great voice.
She's so talented, not just in singing, but in dancing and playing the piano.
I agree. Do you have a favorite song?
Yes, I like Alejandro. What about you?
I like Judas, and Bad Romance
Those are really good.
I think her music videos are some of the best out there
I agree. They are always epic, and they tell a story
Yeah, she's definitely one of the few true talented artists out there today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Gaga's latest album?
Yes, I think!  Unless she's released something recently.
No, I think this album came out last year.
Then yes, I have heard it.  It's very good.
Yeah, I like it.  I just wish she'd go back to the first two albums' sounds.
Yeah, while it's noble that she likes to sing about causes, they aren't really fun to dance to in the club.
You aren't in the club for inspirational messages?
Haha!  No!  Not really.
I totally understand this.
You can't beat Just Dance.  It's one of my all-time favs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The cover of Please Please me is so weird
Why is that the weird part
You telling me you do not think the cover is weird
Nah not at all
The way they look down at you
I guess
It is just creepy
I look at it differently
How is that possible
We all see things different
XXXXXXXXXXX
remember bad romance?
that song was the biggest song of the summer when that song was released.

XXXXXXXXXXX
How many tours has Lady Gaga done?
I'm not really sure.

I know she's appeared on award shows and sang her songs live to promote albums though.
Yes,I've seen her on several
I wonder if she,will ever release an album recorded fro one of her live performances.
That would be cool.
Maybe a mini album from her SUPERBOWL appearance.
Now that would rock
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think of joanne by gaga?
MUCH better than artpop.
I was so disappointed by artpop.
I expected a lot more from gaga.
It seemed rushed and dramatic for no reason.
Dope was the only great song from it.
she brought that song to the highest emotional intensity.
it was sparse and beautiful. it was her and a piano.
joanne brought it back to the simplicity and catchiness.
it sure did
XXXXXXXXXXX
What album was wish you were here from.
It's a lady Gaga song.
Yes it is.
It's off of red and blue I think.

Not good, she should stick with music.
XXXXXXXXXXX

What's your favorite song of hers?
Poker face because everyone should have one.
I like Born This Way cause it's inspirational to LGBT youth.
She is very involved with the LGBT community.
I love her outfits too.
Yeah the Kermit dolls were something but the meat was too much.
Do you think she will still be making music in 10 years?
I wouldn't doubt it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta?
I don't think so who is she?
A really famous singer that was born March 28, 1986 in Manhattan, New York.
Famous singer, name one of her songs.
I will name several,"Born this Way, Just Dance, Poker Face, and Bad Romance".
Those are Lady Gaga's songs aren't they?
Yes, but her real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta.
Wow, no wonder she changed it. That is a lot to put on a bill board.
Sure is. I remember the first time I heard the name Lady Gaga, I thought it was a famous royal person.
Well, she is music royalty.

I heard Lady GaGa is going on tour this year!
I guess that means she's not going to be on American Horror Story again.
Yeah, probably not, but I'd rather see her live.
Same here. I haven't seen her live since her debut.
What songs would you want to hear?

Oh yeah? I mean, I guess I was still in middle school when she was really popular.
Did you ever listen to her non-pop-music stuff?
No, I didn't have internet back then.
Really? That's strange. But yeah, she sang with Tony Bennett once!
That old guy? That's awesome! What's the name of the song?
They did "The Lady is a Tramp" together. It was really cute.
I like her voice well enough, but I'm just not that into new-disco.
Definitely check out The Lady is a Tramp with them, then. She sounds like a lounge singer!
Sweet! I'll look up her newer stuff when I get home.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know where event Lady Gaga wore a dress made from raw beef, now known as the meat dress?
I think it was at an awards show.
Yeah, 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.
I'll bet that was heavy and uncomfortable.
I'll bet it was cold too. They would have to keep it cold so it would not stink.
Oh, yeah. It probably did stink in those hot lights.
She is always coming up with some real attention grabbers.
I heard she works all of the time. She is the type of person that has to create or she gets depressed.
I love to watch her perform she is so amazing.
She has a real talent that is for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you go to see lady Gaga live?
Absolutely I would.
Based on her SUPERBOWL performance it would be some show.
Isn't that the truth.
How about starting the show with god bless America.
No one saw that coming.
Then swinging down from the roof the stadium was incredible.
I couldn't believe what I was watching
Then to sing this land is your land continued to amaze me
She surprised a lot of people
XXXXXXXXXXX
I see Gaga has a top 40 song.

It was kind of a cool video.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude Lady Gaga is an amazing singer even a cappella.
I agree, and I don't even like poppy music.

It kind of does, I can grove to it a bit and it's not my preferred genre.
Well I love her music and her so I may be biased.
I'm not. But her halftime show was kind of funny.
Haha, how so?
She kind of looked like spiderman coming down from the roof of the bowl.

That's what I love most about her.
I love how inclusive she is to all types of people. Really positive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder what Gaga's next era is going to be. What kind of sound her album will have.
I'm hoping she touches back on some dance-pop stuff. She's so good at it.
Yeah, me too. I get she need to make an album like Joanne, it was good she had the chance. But it just didn't seem to click together.
Like something was missing?
I don't know. It just didn't seem like a right fit? But a few of her songs do sound very good. But it's like she's a bit lost on her direction.
Oh right, cause she had that Jazz and Frank Sinatra era.
Did you hear she's going to be back on American Horror Story?
I didn't! That makes sense, they'd be stupid to not offer her another role. She killed it the last time and won an award for it.
Exactly. I wonder what character is going to be, if it's another main character.
I don't know, I haven't anything. Did they say what the season's theme was?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of lady gaga?
I liked her more in the beginning.
With pokerface?

No, I haven't heard it yet. What is your favorite Gaga song?
All time favorite? Just Dance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's song TELEPHONE?
Yes and Beyonce is in it.
I like the soda cans in her hair.
And she is in prison also.
But she gets bailed out.
I like the truck they drive away in.
In the kitchen scene she has that blue phone on her head.
She makes that poison meal.
Yeah, everyone dies.
But I bet it tasted good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you buy Lady Gaga's Joanne album?
No, I was going to.
Well what happened?
I bought ARTPOP when that was released.
What does that have to do with Joanne?
After ARTPOP, she fired her manager and I don't think that her sound would be the same.
Well I bought the Joanne album and I like it.
What's your favorite track off of Joanne?
I like Perfect Illusion.
I like that too but didn't know it was on the Joanne album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady gaga is at her best when she plays with just a piano.
You think so?
listen to dope and speechless.
they're good
its sparse but it allows lady gaga to showcase her vocals.

yeah and when its stripped down, it makes the music stronger.
you can really listen to her voice.
she is the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX

I like the dogs in the video.
You don't see dogs much in videos.
She dances cool.
And makes that funny poker face move around her face.
That song is a classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Lady Gaga performed at the Miss Universe Pageant in 2008?
I love Lady Gaga's music but I have no idea what the Miss Universe pageant is.
It is a pageant that women compete in. In 2008 the pageant was held in Vietnam.
That is cool. I wonder if Lady Gaga was well know in Vietnam at that time?
I don't know. She was not really that famous yet.
Which song did she sing at the pageant?
I think she sung "Just Dance" during the swimsuit competition.
Oh alright. That is one of her first mainstream songs.

I disagree. I think her earlier stuff is better than the stuff she has now.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Aura is my favorite on that one too.
She tends to have blockbuster records over and over.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever hear Telephone by Lady Gaga?
I have! Didn't she make that song with Beyonce?
I believe she did. They also made another track together too.
What was it called? It was called Video Phone.
Awesome! I love it when artists collaborate.
Didn't she also collaborate with someone for the track Just Dance?
She did! It was a singer named Colby O'Donnis.
I've never heard of him before.
I don't think he had a lot of success after the song.
But I'm sure glad he was on that song! I love everything about it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga?
I do!  She seems like an awesome person
Why is that?
I think she is very encouraging and supportive of people
I can see that.
She is also very close to her fans.
DO you like her music?
It's ok... I don' t love all of her songs but there have been a few I really like
Which ones?
I like Paparazzi a lot
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's music?
I like her music but have never like her stage name, sounds like a baby.
I loved her in this years Superbowl half-time show. I hated how some people wrote negative remarks about her weight and some of her outfits.
Some people a just bullies. She is tiny and I did not think that she had a big belly.
When she sang at the superbowl, I could not believe how many songs that I knew that she sang.
She has had alot of top hits, my favorite is Poker Face.
Did you know that her parents stilll have the same home and phone number, as when she grew up.
No, bet that phone rings off the hook. I heard she was bullied so much when she was in high school.
I heard that too! She was pushed in lockers and once they threw in a trash can.
Maybe that is why she is such an advacte against bullying. I wish more people in view of the public could be more like her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
It was fun!
Yea I agree!
I loved her outfit!
Totally Gaga!
Yea and She did the songs that I wanted too!
I couldn't complain about them
I think she should do it next year too!
I bet she will!
Nah, they never have the same person perform 2 yrs in a row
XXXXXXXXXXX
Out of all of Lady Gaga's songs, which one is your favorite?
I really like Alejandro, but Paparazzi is my favorite video. You?
I like Born This Way. It always lifts me up when I'm down.
Oh! I forgot about that. That's maybe mine, too.
Yes. Did I tell you it's helped my little cousin feel better about how she looks?
No. How?
She's been going through an awkward time. I let her listen to it, now it's her favorite.
Oh, wow. That's really cool.
Yeah. She listens to it when she gets ready in the morning.
That's great. I may start doing that as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's newer stuff?
I think so. I actually don't know her new album at all though. What's it called?
Joanne.
That's her real name, isn't it.
Yeah, it is. Have you heard her song Million Reasons?
Yes! Is that on the newest album?
Yeah! I like how deep it is.
Yeah, it's a good song. But Paparazzi will always define her to me.
Well, of course! And Poker Face.
Yes! The Fame is such a fantastic album all the way around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man Have you seen those interviews
What ones
The ones gaga has been giving
Has she mentioned anything interesting
That is an understatement
How so
Well she has been teasing a new album
That sounds promising
It is quite promising
You excited?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Lady Gg's music, don't you?
Yup! Have you bought any of it?
Yeah I have her .mp3 albums.
If you get her albums on CD, don't get them from Walmart.
I'd never go there anyway, but why shouldn't I?
They censored her music.
Yeah, Walmart censors their music to go with their "family-friendly" status.
I wish I had known that at the time. "Bad Romance" isn't the same with certain words deleted.
Ha! Well you can also not buy a CD anymore. It's 2017.
At least her music rocks, all of her songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you ever seen Lady Gaga in concert?
yeah, I've seen her three times!
how was it?
it was amazing! I had a blast.
wow, I am so jealous.
she sounds even better in person than she does on her albums.
What was the audience like?
everyone was really into it.
I hope I can see her live some day!
it was so totally worth it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what do you think about Lady Gaga as a performer
I think that she is a wild and crazy performer
yeah,I can agree with that
Like when she showed up at the award's show wearing a drees made out of raw meat
yeah,that was crazy
what do you think about just her music
I can really get into her music
Yeah,I love the song bad romance
yeah,I like that song too.However I really dig her song poker face
yeah,that is a really cool song
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow, Lady Gaga is an amazing singer!
Yea, she is incredible.
I wonder where she trained.
I'm not sure.  Some artists are self-made.
I don't know, but she has such a great voice.
Her music is so inspiring.
I know.  She can captivate an audience with her music.
Did you ever see her perform live?
Yes, her music was resonating all through the city it was that powerful.
That's so cool you heard her music live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
I didnt see it

Yea I heard it was good
It was!

YOUTUBE NOW!
Okay Okay!
I can't believe you havent seen it!
Sorry!...
No, how did you not hear about it?
Sorry!...
Seriously, what the hell!?
Dude, you gotta calm down..
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you know who Lady Gaga is?
Yeah of course.
Do you like her music?
I am kind of torn on her.
What do you mean?
Well I like some of her songs, but I don't like how over the top she is.
Oh yeah.  Well that is kind of her thing.
Yeah I got that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see lady gaga's performance of million reasons on the american music awards?
I must have missed it, how was it?
It was amazing, she sang it beautifully and was sitting on a stool with a guitar in the grass, the effects were equally as amazing!
Wow, that really does sound amazing. I love hearing her sing live.
Me too! I love watching her acapella videos.
I agree! I have seen so many online. Her voice is really powerful and she has amazing vocals.
Did you see that video of her singing born this way acapella to a young boy?
I did, she was spectacular! I wish I was that little boy that she was singing too.
We should go to a lady gaga concert together one day!
Yes! I hear there is one coming up in August!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know if Lady Gaga speaks french?
No. Why do you ask?
Because she sings some of the lyrics in french for Bad Romance.
Oh, you're right. It's only a few lines though, so she probably only learned a little bit for that song.
Yeah, you're right.
It's still cool that she sang some of it in french, though.
I know. I love that song.
Me too. Did you ever watch the music video for it?
No. Is it any good?
Oh, it's amazing. I would totally recommend that you watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Lady Gaga's performance with Metallica at The Grammys?
I thought it was fantastic. It's just too bad the sound was ruined.
Did you see the video online where they performed with the sound corrected?
Yes, I did, and that's what made me judge it as fantastic!
What did you like about it specifically?
Lady Gaga's version of the vocals, her powerful voice singing a Metal song in her style.
Me too, I thought she did a phenomenal job.
She made the song better in my opinion. I also liked the energy between her and James Hetfield.
Yes, when they put their heads together and sang sharing the microphone, it was electric.
I really wish there were more songs like this!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need to know something
Yes
Well i am wondering what is your favorite Gaga song
oh geeze their is so many
Well pick one
Well this might be cliche
Yes?
I really like poker face i think it is called
Oh that is ok but overplayed
That does not make it bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I finally listened to the Lady Gaga songs you gave me.
Oh yeah? What did you think?
I am so in love with her! She's the best.
I know. Any favorites?
I've been pretty much listening to Bad Romance on repeat all day.
Yeah. It's a winner. Have you seen the video?
No, but I'm guessing I need to!
Yes! It's so high fashioned and weird in the best way, and the dancing is so hot.
All of her dancing is amazing. But her vocals are spot on.
I agree. She sounds even better in concert.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga?
Yes, I love her. She is an amazing performer.
I know! What is your favorite song by her?
Probably Just Dance. It was the first Gaga song I ever heard.
That's a good one. I like the one she did with Beyonce.
Telephone? That one is awesome.
I can't believe she wore that meat suit to an awards show.
I know. She is outrageous.
Have you heard any of the songs she did with Tony Bennett?
Yes. That was very cool that she did that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to Lady Gaga?
She is one of the few newer singers I will listen to occasionally.
Do you like her music?
It is okay, I wouldn't buy it, but I won't change the radio station if it comes on.
What's your favorite song by her?
Probably bad romance I would say.
Same here.  I think it is fun to see what she is going to do next.
Yeah, she really knows how to push the envelope.
She sure does.  She makes things entertaining.
She is certainly different.  In a good way though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Everyone loves Lady Gaga! What's your favorite song by her?
I really like her very first hit, 'Just Dance.'
That song never gets old!
Confession! I still listen to it this day.
I really like 'Born This Way' because it speaks so much truth.
I agree, the lyrics there are pretty deep.
Did you know she has a collaboration with Tony Bennett?
Really? What's it called?
She has a whole jazz album and it's different but I love 'Cheek to cheek.'
I'll need to look that up on Youtube! Thanks for sharing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite song from Lady Gaga?
I love Bad Romance
Do you like Just Dance and Paparazzi?
Yes, those are good too.
What is your favorite album?
I love the one called The Fame
What is that one?
That is her debut album
Is it very good?
It was nominated for a Grammy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the first Lady Gaga song you heard?
Just Dance was the first one I heard on the radio
That song came out in 2008, right?
I think Akon was a co-writer of Just Dance
And RedOne.  His name gets a shout out at the start of the song.
I liked the video a lot too.  Lady Gaga produces really dynamic music videos.
I think my favorite early Lady Gaga video was Poker Face.
That was her next number 1 hit after Just Dance, right?
Yes, Poker Face is also on Lady Gaga's debut album.
The Fame was a really solid album. No wonder Lady Gaga became so popular.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Lady Gaga, do you?
Yes absolutely!
That's awesome!  Have you seen her in American Horror Story?
Yes she is an amazing actress
What is your favorite of her videos?
Millions reasons is my favorite!
I would love to go to one of her concerts!
I have been !  She is amazing!
You are so lucky!  We should go to the next one together!
Yes let's go!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Gagas ideals
What you mean
Well they flow into her music
That is nice
Well most artists do not have that
I can see that
Usually it is super ficial
Yeah it is
But with her its legit
I do like that too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady GAGA?
Yes, she is ok. People tell me I look like her.
Yes, you do a little. What's your favorite song by her?
I like Poker Face.
She is a great entertainer.
Definately. And I agree with most of her stance.
I wish she would be more into animal rights.
I agree. That meat dress was ridiculous.
She wears fur also.
I don't know for sure about that. It could be faux.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder how the song bad romance became so popular
I do not know
Yeah it is just weird
I know it is one of her worst
Easily is her worst
Pretty much is
I like most of her music but that song
Ugh it is so overplayed
I know the radio plays it non stop
Its annoying
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get to listen to Lady Gaga's album Born this Way?
Yes, I think so, but it has been a while.
I loved that one. Fashion of His Love and Electric Chapel were in that album.
Yes, she has produced some serious work.
I also liked Born This Way as well.
Who was the label for it?
I think  Interscope Records.
Do you know some of the producers?
To name a few:  Dj White Sadhow, DJ Snake, Lady Gaga, Robert John Lange, Jeppe Laursen, RedOne, Clinton Sparks
Wow, that one was great for a reason!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you like Lady Gaga?
Yeah she's okay.
Just okay?
Yeah I don't really like her a whole lot.
Why not?
I think she is talented don't get me wrong, but...
but what?
She's just so over the top I can't handle it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know Lady Gaga's music?
Yes.
do you like it?
Yes.  I really like her song "bad romance."
me, too.
I heard once how she explained it, such as with the chorus.  Very interesting!
right.  I had not known that  either.
I thought she had been just making up certain sounds, but it is really words.
Yep.  Same, here.
It was not until I saw her  explain it on a TV show, where I then learned the true words and meaning behind it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it just me or was Artpop an underrated album?
I believe that it was underrated. I think that Gypsy is a top 5 Lady Gaga song that no one talks about.
Yeah. I just think that it gets a bad reputation because it under performed commercially.
I would probably attribute that to the weakness of the lead single, Applause.
Yeah, and Do What U Want didn't get the promotion it deserved.
Agreed. I like it when Lady Gaga collaborates with other artists on songs and wish she did it more.
I think that her collaborations are hit or miss. While I liked Do What U Want, I found Telephone very overrated.
Aside from the music video being too long, I loved that song when it came out.
The length wasn't the issue for me. I just thought that Lady Gaga and Beyonce made a weird mix.
Really, I thought the fact that the two perfectly complemented each other in the song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is Lady Gaga up to these days?
I know she has a few new songs out but I haven't heard much from her since the Superbowl.
What are some of her new songs?
One is called A Million Reasons, which I think was played during the Superbowl.  And a newer one if called The Cure.
Wonder why it hasn't been as popular.
Probably because there really isn't any controversy surrounding it.
I wish she would go on tour again.  I haven't seen her perform live yet.
I think she is currently on tour, you can check online for dates.
Wonder how much tickets are?
I would pay a ton of money to go see her perform, she is a great at everything.  I am amazed that she can play piano on top of everything else.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to Lady Gaga's music.
Of course!
Have you heard her new album yet?
No not yet!
You should take a listen! It is quite good!
Amazing, I will do so.
What song do you like by her?
I like Alejandro.
That sound is very unique.
It has a spanish flair and it is cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Holy Moly, did you just see what "Lady Gaga" was wearing on the award show?
No, What kind of crazy thing did she wear this time?
It was an outfit made out of meat!
Are you serious?  Even her shoes?
Yes the shoes too, that is one nasty thing to wear.
I can only imagine that flies were all over her
I used to think Bjork was nuts when she wore that dress that looked like a swan but I think the meat suit wins hands down
no kidding I wonder if she was making a statement or if she is just being eclectic
Well one thing is for sure it couldn't have been for PETA
(chuckles) yeah maybe she is just stating that meat is awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember when gaga was on top of the world?
she used to be the biggest artist around.
now beyonce kinda took control of it.
beyonce has the crown now.
lady gaga stopped being in the spotlight.
and stopped making headlines just due to her outfit.
maybe thats what she needs to do again.
it did give her a lot of publication.
she is still doing her thing though.
yup. joanne is a good album
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Lady Gaga live?
No, I haven't. But I'd really love to! Have you?
Yes, I saw her perform on the Today Show a few years back. She was great.
That's awesome! What's your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I really like her new song "Million Reasons".
I haven't heard that one yet, I'll have to check it out.
You should, it's a really touching song. What about you?
I like most of her older work. But they're all so good I can't choose!
I know what you mean, she's a great artist.
Yep! She's the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga is famous for making records. But, she's also a songwriter.
Yes, she's written music for several other artists in addition to herself.
Can you give me an example?
She wrote The Greatest Thing for Cher.
Wow, that's impressive.
It's just one of many examples.
Give me another, then.
Okay, she wrote Quicksand for Britney Spears.
That's a good one! You know any others?
She definitely likes to write for artists who are similar to herself -- pop stars. Another example is Hypnotico for Jennifer Lopez.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga?
While I like some of her music, she has always kind of annoyed me.
Yeah.  I know what you mean.  It is like she tries way to hard.
Exactly!  I do have to admit that she does have an incredible voice.
I know.  I was shocked when she performed Julie Andrews classics.
I know.  I was blown away.
I also like her duet with Tony Bennett.
She did do a good job with that.  Her other music is alright too.  I really like that Poker Face song when I am working out.
Agreed.  Her music is good to workout too.
Yep.  Like you said before, her music is good enough but her persona and antics are her drawback.  I guess it is what she had to do to get noticed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Lady Gaga's music
well, her music style varies along with the advancement of her ages
yea, you spotted a pattern?
yea kinda of, before Gaga was married, her songs were more wild and energetic, such as Paparazzi and Poker face.
I heard those 2 songs have broken quite some records
yes indeed, and I personally like them very much
I heard them quite often back then as well, but have you seen the music of video of Paparazzi?
no, I can only imagine it was wild
wild indeed, Gaga put herself in quite a show, the video involves around her secret relationship with a man
could it be reflecting her real life?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your least favorite Gaga song?
I would go with born this way.
Really? That was such a popular track.
It was well done. But I can't help but think she ripped off Madonna on this track.
I Madonna is one of her bigger influences.
Well to me it sounds to much like a certain Madonna song.
Which one exactly?
Express yourself. It is clear the similarity.
I don't hear it myself. weird.
Not weird , true. Even Madonna felt ripped off by Gaga on this track.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Lady GaGa's new album?
The jazz one with Tony Bennet, you mean?
No she recently released a new LP.
Oh, really? What's it called.
It's called Joanne. But I don't really like it.
I liked Born This Way and Artpop. What's up with Joanne?
Well she tried to go country. It's a really odd result.
I can't imagine her singing a country record.
Well, it's country mixed with pop. It'll time some time to get used to it.
At the very least, she was pretty good at the Superbowl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the most underrated Lady Gaga song?
I would have to say her song Bloody Mary.
I know what you mean. I like the deep voice in the background of that song that keeps saying 'Gaga'.
What do you think is the most underrated Lady Gaga song?
I would say her song The Queen.
I love listening to that song. It always makes me feel better.
Me too. It reminds me to always be a queen.
Haha. It's too bad it was only a bonus track on her album Born This Way.
I totally agree. I like the other bonus track on that album, Fashion of His Love.
Me too. I love the beat in that song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen lady gaga live?
no but i really want to
she puts on an amazing show
she can really sing and dance.
she doesnt lip sync either
she is a great performer.
she deserves her fame.
and she cares about her fans too
lady gaga is great
lets see her live
XXXXXXXXXXX
how will you like to go with me to a concert?
what kind of concert you talking about?
a gospel concert where Tammie yeoman is singing.
what is some of the songs she will be singing?
i don't no but i no all of her song is good.
i like the one take me to the king. do you like that one too.
yes i love that one .so is a date
yes just let me no when you plan to go.
OK but we need to be early because i no it will be a lots of peoples there,
thanks i will be listen for your call.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to any Lady Gaga recently?
Yeah I like her Fame Monster album.
What songs do you like from that?
I like the song Speechless.
That is a very underrated song.
I totally agree. She is fantastic on that.
I like the song Teeth.
That is kind of a weird song though.
Perhaps, but not for me.
Maybe I will give it another shot then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Lady Gaga sing Sound of Music?
I heard she did that but, I didn't see it. Did you?
I did! I loved it.
She sang it at an awards show, right?
Yeah, The Oscars. You should look it up.
I will. I wouldn't have guessed that the same woman that sang Poker Face would be singing from an old musical.
Me either! But it was fantastic.
What made it so special?
I guess the fact that it was unexpected! But, it was also really beautiful and elegant.
Now, I have to see it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Lady Gaga's first album?
Is that the one with Just Dance?
Yes, it is.
I absolutely love that album.  I can listen to it all the way through.
I am the same way!
I can pretty much listen to everything she puts out.
Some songs are definitely misses with me.  But for the most part, they are all great.
I think she's the greatest singer of our generation.
Oh definitely!  Beyonce is great, too.
But she's no Gaga!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Lady Gaga's collaborations with Beyonce?
I think they are great! They both are good at sharing time and making sure that their styles are incorporated.
Did you like Video Phone or Telephone?
I prefer Telephone because it has a better dance beat, but Video phone is fun and sexy.
I really like the Video Phone music video, personally, because of all the different styles Beyonce wears.
Me too! I just mean that I like to work out and dance to Telephone better, but the Video Phone video is better than Telephone.
I agree totally. Which vocals do you like better Beyonce's or Lady Gaga's in Telephone?
I like Lady Gaga's more because she has a bit more energy. What about you?
I like Beyonce's a bit better because she sounds like you don't want to mess with her. What about the vocals in Video Phone?
Oh for sure Beyonce outperforms Lady Gaga just by the sheer differences in styles she uses throughout the track.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Lady Gaga's real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta?
Wow really.. I didn't know that.
She's one of my all time favorite singers.  Her performances are awesome.
I've seen her perform the song Bad Romance.  I really loved it.
I plan to go to her concert in Las Vegas in August.  Would you like to go?
That would be so much fun.  Let's plan to go.
I'll price the tickets.  Omg... I can't wait to see Lady Gaga on stage.
I hope she sings Born this way.  I love that song.
This will be the best trip ever.
I'm so excited.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Lady Gaga's new song?
I'm not sure. What is it called?
I think it's called A Million Reasons, but I'm not sure.
That sounds familiar, I think I've heard it.
I felt like it was a totally new sound for her. How about you?
She reinvents herself all the time, so not really.
I like it. I wonder if she is putting out a new album soon.
If she has a new song on the radio than probably. Are you going to buy it?
I will probably stream it on Spotify if it's on  there.
Sounds like a good idea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whos your favorite artist.
Lady gaga
Shes good
You like her?
Yes
What songs do you like
Alejandro, love game, poker face
Those are all good songs
I dont think she has bad songs
Me either
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just bought Lady Gaga's new album.
I didn't know she'd released a new one. What's it called?
The album's name is Joanne. Have you heard any of the singles from it?
I've heard Perfect Illusion and Million Reasons.
I love Million Reasons! I sing along to it in the car.
I don't know. I like her older songs better.
Do you mean the ones from Artpop or the ones from The Fame?
I like The Fame better, but I also like Born This Way. The Fame had the most unique stuff.
I'd never heard anything like Bad Romance before she made that song.
Gaga brought a new style to pop music, and she's also got an incredible voice that you can hear best in songs like The Edge of Glory.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get to listen to Lady Gaga's album Born this Way?
I didn't get to purchase that one.  How was it?
It has some amazing songs on the album.
Which are you favorites?
Marry the Night, Judas, and Born This Way are some great songs on it!
I think that album came out in 2011 under  Interscope Records.
Just Dance is my favorite album, that came out in 2008.
Yes the whole album is that remixed!
I know! Too funny!
I think she got some awards for it as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Lady Gaga song do you think would be good to work out to?
Applause would be a good uptempo song to excercise to.
Oh, yeah.  I could picture that one playing during a spin class.
Maybe even Bad Romance.
That could work, too.
A lot of her songs have a fast tempo, don't you think?
Yeah.  Born This Way is pretty fast.
So is Just Dance.
Is Paparazzi fast or slow?
I think it's in between.  It's not exactly a dance song, but it has a good tempo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I spent all yesterday night watching old Lady Gaga videos.
Oh yeah?
Yes. I was just feeling really down, and her music always makes me feel really strong.
I can see that. Any songs in particular?
I love Born This Way and Applause.
Applause is my wake-up alarm song.
What a good idea to wake up to something that gets you ready to meet the day!
Exactly. I like how a lot of her songs have the theme of being yourself.
Yeah. She just owns it. She doesn't seem to follow trends.
No. Lady Gaga sets the trends.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite Lady Gaga Song?
I would have to say Paparazzi.
What do you think the song is about?
It talks about how someone that is in love with you will follow you everywhere like a Paparazzi.
What do you think of her music videos?
I believe her songs are very good, but I think she could make her videos more kid friendly.
What other song do you think are good?
Oh I love Telephone and Alejandro.
Do you remember one of her earlier songs?
Yes! Bad Romance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Lady Gaga has a foundation called the "Born this way foundation"?
No, I didn't what do they support?
It is a foundation that focuses on promoting youth empowerment and combating bullying.
I wonder if she was bullied as a child.
I don't know but she is so different I'll bet she was.
Have you heard the song she sang with Tony Bennett?
"Cheek to Cheek" I love that song.
Me too and their voices blended together so beautifully.
I think I saw her on the television singing a country song.
Really, that would be cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching the halftime show right now?
Just turned it on. Wow! Her outfit is amazing.
I know. I can't believe she's performing Born This Way at a football halftime show.
Right? And they are loving it.
I'm so glad. I think it is such a wonderful message.
I also love Telephone. It's completely my dancing song.
It's so high-energy and makes me feel fierce.
Million Reasons is so beautiful.
I love that she can play the piano.
I know. She is such a talented musician.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am frustrated
Why are you frustrated
Because i want Gaga to explore another genre
What do you mean
She is so much more talented than just doing pop music
But is she not good at it
Her music is god tier but i want more
Well maybe she might collab with metallica
That is what i am hoping
Well it might happen
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to choose five all time favorite Lady Gaga songs what would they be?
They would be Bad Romance, Paparazzi, Born This Way, Perfect Illusion, and Monster. You?
I like Bad Romance, Judas, You and I, Marry The Night, and Alejandro.
Those are great too. You and I is really fun, but also romantic.
I agree. Why do you like Monster? I never got that one.
I think that it comes off as silly as first, but it could be deeper.
What do you mean?
I feel like it represents this type of guy who starts off as just a fun fling, but then ends up breaking your heart.
That makes sense. I'll give it another try.
You should. A lot of her songs are both relatable and empowering.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Lady Gaga?
I am! I started listening to her in high school.
Same here. What is your favorite album?
The Fame, definitely.
Mine is Artpop. What is your favorite song on The Fame?
Poker Face.
That's my favorite song by her overall.
Mine is Paparazzi. It's the first song I heard by her.
What's your least favorite song by her?
Paper Gangster.
XXXXXXXXXXX
YOu know it is weird she has two albums with similar names
That is not that weird
But thats the weird part
huh
Well they are similar but they sound different
I get that sorta makes sense
Well yeah it does
Its odd but not that weird
I guess she is a odd person
precisely
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga?
I think she's weird.
Of course, that's why she's Lady Gaga.
I mean what kind of name is that any way?
It fits her. So you don't like her?
I think she's okay. I like the song Paparrazzi.
I like that song, too.
I'm not really a big fan of pop music, though. Why do you ask?
I was just wondering. She's coming to town I hear.
I think I'll pass on that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
No opinion...
Why?
I don't like her music
Why?
I don't want to talk about it
Why so uptight?
I'm NOT!
Okay buddy...
GET AWAY FROM ME!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Lady Gaga fan?
She has an amazing voice.
I heard her sing live on Howard Stern and it was awesome.
She sounded just as good live as on the radio.  That is very rare
Her sounds like Bad Romance and Poker face were fun.
I really liked paparazzi. I liked to dance to it.
Her newest album has some good songs also.
I heard the song million reasons the other day.  That was pretty good
Have you ever scene her in concert?
No, but some friends of mine have and said it was a great show.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Lady Gaga?
I love the jazz music she does with Tony Bennett.
I don't like those songs. I like her Pop Songs.
I admit her Pop Songs are better than the stuff on the radio now but not as good as her covers of the classic American song book.
I think that Poker Face is one of the best pop songs since Madonna.
See, I thought she was a wannabe Madonna before I heard her jazz songs.
What do you think of Joanne.
Eh. Not bad but not great.
Well, we agree on something.
I would rather hear her pop music though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I so enjoyed Lady Gaga's half time superbowl  show.
Her voice has such great pitch.
My favorite song is born this way.
I really liked her on Tony Bennett 90th birthday show.
She is such a great showmanship with her songs.
My favorite song is bad romance.
Lady Gaga is young and refreshing.
I am so glad she stopped wearing those ridiculous outfits.
It is so nice that her and Tony Bennett sing so well together.
Lady Gaga has such a wonderful voice. It is so easy to listen to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
Do you like Lady Gaga?
Yeah she's okay with me.
Have any favorite songs?

She sounds good on the piano on that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Hey, have you heard Lady Gaga's most recent album?
I'm not sure? What was it called again.
It's called Joanne and it features the song 'Dancing in Circles'.
Oh I did hear that song but no I have not heard the whole album.
You are missing out dude. It is definately the album of the year.
Wow. It must be a really good album then. My personal favorite will always be 'The Fame'.
I loved that album. It was so iconic.
What was your favorite song from that album?
My favorite song was 'Paparazzi'. What was yours?
That was a good song but mine is Poker Face. It is such a classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know who signed Lady Gaga?
I heard it was an r & b group.
Not a group,it was Akon.
Oh wow,cool.
He heard her and signed her to his own label.
And the rest they say is history.
Lots of history.
She was 22 when she officially debuted.
That's pretty young
Young and successful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think that ARTPOP is underappreciated?
I think there was a problem with management during that time and it wasn't promoted well.
What is your favorite Gaga song?
I can't choose one! I'd go with Venus or Diamond Heart.
Those are awesome songs! Are you going to her tour this summer?
Yeah! I'm going to two concerts.
What songs do you hope Gaga will perform?
I'd love to hear Just Dance again even though it's been overplayed over the years.
I know, can you believe she's been around since 2008?
No, it seems like just yesterday the Just Dance was on the radio!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga?
I love her! I think she's so progressive and distinct and her music is a good role model for young girls.
Great, because someone gave me some of her music and I don't want it. You can have it.
What, you don't like her?
I'm not a fan. All her music sounds the same and it's so one-dimensional to me.
Aw, I'm sorry to hear you say that.
It's all good, she's just not my personal taste.
Well I would love to take whatever you've got off your hands.
Great! I'll bring you the albums next time I see you.
I can't wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that performance

The one with Lady Gaga
Oh with that rock band

It was decent i suppose
It was so much more than that
Was it?
It was the  best ever
I guess
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga?
I think she's kind of strange, but some of her songs are pretty great.
Yeah, I think so too. I heard she used to look a lot different before she became famous.
I think you're right. She used to have darker hair and looked like your average person.
She doesn't look bad now. She just has a unique sense of style.
I guess you could call it that.
Her clothes make a statement.
What kind of statement, exactly?
I think just a statement that she's different from other pop stars and not afraid to do something outside of the box, you know?
I suppose. Either way, I like her music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What album of lady gaga that was nominated in six grammys?
It was The Fame Monster.

What do you think about Lady Gaga's album 'Joanne'?
I enjoyed it and I think it showcases another talent of hers.
I think it shows how diverse she can be.
I agree. Her cover of 'Cheek to Cheek' with Tony Bennett was good too.
Do you think those covers of old standards appealed to younger fans?
I think her appeal spans several generations.
I am happy she is known for more than just her fashion choices.
Do you think she will return to dance music?
I would love to see her write another song like 'Poker Face'.
I still think 'The Fame Monster' was a masterpiece!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Lady Gaga'a new song?
I'm not sure, when did it come out?
I think it came out in late March or early April.
What is the name of the song?

Do you like it?
I actually do and I downloaded it from youtube.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do,you think lady Gaga is cool?
I think she's very cool.
She wears some strange outfits.
Yes she does but what a voice.
I liked born this way from the monster ball tour.
Reall good tune.
How about poker face too.
That was a good one also.
Was that off the fame lp?
Yes it was
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I was in my car driving last night and that Bad Romance song came on.
Okay.  What'd you think?
That song is kind of trippy.  It's late at night, you're by yourself...
Trippy?  It's not that creepy.
The way she sings it is kind of nuts.
Just because it sounds kind of electronic?
It's just that they made her deep voice even deeper.
And that gives you the creeps?
I'm just saying, the chorus made me creeped out.
You've got some serious issues, my man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
Terrible music
Terrible...?
We don't get along
get along..?
Yea I knew her in highschool

XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's recent music?
It's interesting, it sounds almost like country music.
Oh right, you mean in her new song "A Million Reasons". It wasn't my favorite.
Which songs of her's do you prefer?
I like the classics, like "Poker Face".
Yea, those are really good. Reminds me of college.
The dance songs she makes are good for partying!
They get a little annoying after awhile though, don't you think?
Yea, that's a good point. But the music videos were so cool too.
I love all of her costumes!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga's music?
I hear her music in the clubs all the time. It's very danceable.
You can really move to it. But she also has a few ballads. They're quite beautiful.
She has an amazing voice.
Her personality is something else, too!
Did you see the meat dress she wore to the Grammy's a few years ago?
Disgusting! But it was just a political statement. She's not the airhead people make her out to be.
Quite the contrary. I watched Howard Sterm interview her, and she came off as very intelligent and well-spoken.
I saw that interview too! It was strange to see her without her "costume."
She looks pretty ordinary, doesn't she? But man, that voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever been to a Lady Gaga concert?
I have not but I love her music! What is your favorite song?
The song she sings about Nebraska in, do you know the name of it?
Yes! It's called You and I! It's a great powerful song.
I agree a lot of her music is super powerful. What's your favorite song?
I absolutely love dancing to Paparazzi, it was the first song that I ever heard from her.
Yes, I remember every word of that song. Do you know any of her songs by heart?
I know Bad Romance by heart, definitely.
Did you see her at the Superbowl?
I didn't, I like Lady Gaga but not football so much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
Overrated
Really?  I thought it was unique
How
The entrance
Hmmm..
Who has come in from the sky like that before?
I guess nobody
See?
Good call
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Lady Gaga's new album.
Yes, it's the best!
I love the song John Wayne.
Me too, have you seen the music video?
I didn't even know there was one.
Yeah it's really good.
Cool, what was your favorite song?
I really liked the song Joanne.
Yeah, it was so beautiful.
Yeah I loved the country feel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the music awards last night?
yes I did, who was your favorite?
Definitely Lady gaga, that woman is a true artist
I agree, she is very stylish as well, whats your favorite song?
I like a few, but the one that I love is poker face
Oh ya, I like that, makes me want to dance. I love "do what u want"
That one is good too, have you ever been to one of her performances
sadly no, I would love to though
I have tickets, want to join me next weekend?
I would love that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get to buy Hitmixes?
Who had that album?
That is one of Lady Gaga's albums. It was released in 2009.
What was the label for that one?
Interscope Records released it for Lady Gaga that year.
Who were the producers?
Chew Fu, Guena Lg, RedOne, Space Cowboy were the producers.
I may have heard some of the songs on it perhaps.
Love Game is on that one.
Just Dance I think as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga has such a beautiful voice.
I agree. She sounded amazing when she sang the National Anthem at the Super Bowl.
Yeah she sounded great, but her outfit was crazy.
You have to admit it was a little more toned down than some of her other looks.
True. Her style when she released The Fame is so different from her style now.
Even her music is different now. Her newest album Joanne is much more alternative sounding.
I love that album. My favorite song from it is Million Reasons.
I like that song too, but my all time favorite song by her is probably Bad Romance.
Yeah, that was one of her biggest hits.
Monster and Poker Face were really popular songs too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any Lady Gaga songs you totally hate?
I like some but I do not like 'Born This Way' or 'Poker Face.' I totally loathe 'Bad Romance.'
Why's that?
Her manly voice n those songs bugs me.
Oh, I see. I actually agree.
I like 'You and I' because her voice is better on that one.
It is. I agree. She is a good singer when she tries.
She is. I wonder why she doesn't always sing like that.
I'm ot sure because it's better.
Maybe she thinks that makes her sound edgy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Lady Gaga - G.U.Y. - An ARTPOP Film?
Yes, I enjoy it.
Me too but the opening reminds me of the simpsons episode where they think they found a fallen angel.
Funny That is kind of similar, I can see it now.
I like the whole concept a lot.
Her wings are beautiful in the film. I also enjoy everything at the main house/palace.
I really love the film, but I also love the lyrics and beat as well.
I like the part when she does like a voice over just talking about being guided.
I like the dance break when they are wearing white.
Overall a lot of thought went into it and I LOVE IT.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really did not like Gagas last album
Which album was that
Joanne
Oh yea that one was kinda meh to me
Just something feels off about it
Pretty much feels like it is missing something
Yeah i gave it three listens to be sure
Pretty much same
Such a shame hopefully the next is better
I am hoping so too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Lady Gaga in concert?
No I haven't, have you?
Yeah, I saw her when she came to town last year!

I LOVE Telephone, did she play that one?
Yeah, and Beyonce even came out!
OMG, I wish I would
XXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga is definitely a popular figure in music. Are you fan?
I think her music is okay, but I do not consider myself a massive fan.

Probably the most well-known, which is "Just Dance."
I agree with that pick. That song definitely brings back some fun memories.
I do think she is very talented and has a unique personality.
She is definitely unique, which I think is part of her charm and appeal.
How do you figure?
I just think in these days, there is much content and many artists out there, it is important to standout and be different.

XXXXXXXXXXX

Why did you like her older stuff?
I think that her older music was more catchy, it was one of those things that i didn't care for at first but found myself singing through out the day.
Oh, I understand that. What about her half time show?
I think that when she is preforming she is entertaining even if i don't like the particular song she is singing.
She is an amazing performer, that jump during the half time show was amazing.
That was amazing. I think that her willingness to go 100 percent into her shows is why she has so many fans of such different backgrounds.
What do you mean?
I think that the fact that she always give 100 percent to her singing, wardrobe, and performance makes her interesting to people of all ages and backgrounds to some extent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
YOu know Gaga wears some weird stuff
Well is that what not makes her amazing
I guess it would be the reason
Yeah she goes outside the box in many ways
Many?
Well her music is not typical pop
Well yeah i know that
And she also starred in american horror story
I know she is a good actress too
She is a jack of all trades
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like listening to Lady Gaga?
Yes.  I think she is so talented.  I would love to see her in concert.
I couldn't believe how well she did at the Superbowl halftime show.  That was super entertaining.
I didn't realize those were all drones that were flying through the air at the beginning of it.
I'm guessing she had something to do with the planning of that whole performance.
Probably.  She's so original.  Can you imagine wearing a meat dress.
I think that's kind of disgusting, but leave it to her.
I have to say that I like to try and sing along with her when I hear her song "Poker Face".
I imagine you look pretty weird driving in a car singing that.
Oh, I only do it when there is nobody around.  Otherwise I would probably look like I'm having a seizure or something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like her most recent album, "Joanne"?
I do. It was quite a departure. You?
I'm not a huge fan of it.
Keep listening. I think it will grow on you.

I have so many.
Okay, well lets do a top 2 then.
Okay, my first one would be Judas.
Judas? I guess that's a good one.
Yeah, I just always liked the beat and the tempo.
I gotcha. And your other one?
Okay, I really like A Million Reasons.
Isn't that a new song by her?
Yeah, it's great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
lady gaga music is so mellow

she works so hard and has good music all the time
i lover her songs there very heart felt
she can also  blow her lungs out

i think that would be the song she sung in the superbowl
yes that song was a hit from her
yes it was and she has lots of great songs
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about Lady Gaga's music?
I don't actively seek out her music, but when it comes on the radio, I don't turn it off.
Yeah? What song do you like most?
I've actually heard Paparazzi a lot lately and have found it stuck in my head.
Ha, that's funny. Are you aware of her support of LGBT rights?
Yes, I actually saw her recently on RuPaul's Drag Race.
I saw that too. I just wish they would have played some of her music during the episode. I kept seeing her and wanting to hear Poker Face or Bad Romance.
I agree. It was strange seeing her for that much of an episode, but not hearing any of her music.
Does she have any new music coming out?
I'm not sure. I think she just had an album come out last year, so probably not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Lady Gaga once was the opener for Backstreet Boys?
No, I had no idea, she has come a long way
Yeah, she used to be somewhat normal until she was discovered.
Yeah, she has turned into the new Madonna
Did you see her perform the National Anthem at Super Bowl 50?
Yes, it was great performace, she is very talented.
Yeah, I wish she would focus more on her music then the act, she has an amazing voice
Have you heard her new album?  It is a little more tame than "Born this way"
Yeah, but her sales are way down, makes you wonder how long fame actually lasts.
Agreed, but I still love the new songs, especially "Perfect Illusion".
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved when lady gaga recorded that album with Tony Bennet
I didn't like that as much. his music isn't very interesting.
Yeah, but I was surprised she had such a great voice.
I guess. I also like her political stances.
Yeah I guess it's cool that she tries to use her fame for good.
What did you think of her on American Horror Story?
I loved it. I wish she would act more.
Her videos are always pretty great.
I still love the Poker face video.
I do too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like the song love game
Who is that by?
Lady Gaga
Oh okay
Do you like her
Yes shes a great artist
I cant believe love game came out in 2008
It was that long ago?
Yes
Seems like yesterday
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like Lady Gaga's new song, do you?
Yes, I love it!  I really like Lady Gaga.
Me too.  I just saw her on an episode of Rupaul's Drag Race. Did you see it?
No!  I'll have to go back and watch that.
She was so nice and helpful on it, she seems like a nice person.
Oh, that's awesome!  What's your favorite song of hers?
I really like Paparazzi. How about you?
I like Alejandro.
Oh yeah that's a good one too.
It's my favorite!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to Lady Gaga?
No, I only have heard some of her hits.
She's a legend and a true artist.
Is she though? She seems like a cookie cutter pop star to me.
What do you mean? What other pop star has worn raw meat on their body as a dress?
Wasn't Art Pop her last album? It's only for shock value so tabloids will print her.
She's a talented singer. What's not to like?
Yeah, she does sing better than some pop stars, but all her songs sound like everything else.
"Pokerface" was a masterpiece! She even does tributes to classic rock legends. I think she performs jazz too.
That's great, but her talent and art image hasn't really kept her relevant. Her career seems to be on the decline.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow, did you hear Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett's "Cheek to Cheek" album?
No I haven't yet! I've been meaning to for a while.
Oh, well it's a must-listen if you're a fan of hers.
What's your favorite song on the album?
My favorite song on the album is "Ev'ry Time We Say", the piano and her voice sound so magical to me.
That's great, I really can't wait to listen to it, I'm a really big fan of hers.
What was the first song you heard by her?
The first song by her was "Paparazzi", I thought it was a really catchy song.
Oh yeah! I love that song too, it's one of my favorites by her.
This is great, I love that we can talk about Lady Gaga like this!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga as an actress in American Horror Story?
I have never seen it, is she any good?
She really is pretty good.  I was impressed.
It's not my kind of show, I like her music though.
So do I.  Lately I can't get enough of Million Reasons.
Yes, that one is definitely one of my favorites.  But You and I is my favorite.
I like that one too, I hope she continues doing well.  Even though she is a little eccentrc, I still like her.
Yes, her outfits are sometimes a little outrageous.
Especially the meat dress, who does that.
Someone who doesn't care what people think, apparently.
XXXXXXXXXXX
John Wayne is so amazing.
Yeah he is! I didn't know you liked old westerns.
... I was talking about the Lady Gaga song.
Of course you were...
I really think you'd like it.
I don't think so I'm not really a fan of Lady Gaga.
I know, but her most recent album is almost country music.
Hmm, I'll have to check it out.
It's called Joanne. I reallly think you'll like it.
Okay I'll  check it out

So I found out an interesting fact about Lady Gaga.
Oh yeah, what's that?
Did you know that she used to primarily write songs for other people to preform?
I think I remember hearing that before. Who did she write for?
Well, back in the day,she co-wrote songs for The Pussycat Dolls, Fergie and New Kids On The Block.
Wow, I always thought New Kids On The Block wrote their own songs.
Nope. Most singing groups like that have someone else writing their lyrics.
Oh, I didn't know. So what did you find out about Lady Gaga?
She wrote two tracks for Jennifer Lopez’s new album Love.
Oh wow, I love that album! Its so cool that Lady Gaga helped write some songs for it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to Lady Gaga's new albume?
You mean Joanne? Yes, I've listened to it.
What did you think of it?
It was good. But my favorite Lady Gaga album is The Fame.
Isn't that her debut album.
Yes, it is. There's so many great songs on it.
My favorite song from that album is Poker Face.
That's a good song. But my favorite is Just Dance.

Yes, Just Dance was released in 2008.
XXXXXXXXXXX

I agree. She appeals to so many populations of people.
I love how she is a pop singer but she can also sing classical or rock music.
She has amazing vocals, that's for sure.
Yea, I love her and her music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey cousin did you have a great time at the skating ring tonight? as they kept playing repeats of Lady Gaga's hit song Poker Face. over and over and over.
yes I enjoyed myself they did play her hit too many times but I like Lady Gaga's music you do to right.
Yeah but she dresses awfully weird did you see those outfits she was wearing in the video they were showing?
That's just how Lady Gaga dresses she would not be herself if she didn't. She never looked too bad she never does.
Yes she don't her style is like American fashion and punk rock mixed she likes being different.
Cool I liked the white long bob style wig she wore in Poker Face. Have you ever seen Bad Romance you are to see how weird she dresses in that video.
How much big of a fan would you say you are of Lady Gaga? If i were to win ticket's or purchase some to go see her concert would you be willing to go with me?
Of course i would. I would be very overwhelming that you got us the tickets.

Pretty much the ones I hear on the radio, like Poker Face and Alejandro.
Yeah, most people seem to like her radio hits.
Her music is definitely catchy. What are your favorites of hers?
I really like Judas and The Edge of Glory.
Cool. Have you seen her in concert?
Not yet, but I'm hoping to soon.
Did you know she'll be in our area next month?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your first Lady gaga song?
I heard her through Bad romance
oh really? what did you think of her then
Honestly, I wasn't a fan at first I thought she was weird
what was weird about her?
mostly her costumes and the way she presents herself
I can see how that can be a turnoff
but i still like her music
What is your favorite current song
I do love The Cure
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember lady gaga's first album?
The Fame? Yes, it was an amazing dance album!
What do you think of lady gaga's style?
I think she has evolved over the years but kept true to herself.
Do you know lady gaga's real name?
Yes, it is Stephanie Germanotta!
What was your favorite crazy outfit lady gaga ever wore?
The meat dress has to be the craziest.
What is your favorite lady gaga song?
Money Honey is a great dance hit!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into Lady Gaga at all?
I like her music but I hate her style.
That is understandable.
When she wore the meat dress I was disgusted. But I love her Fame album.
What songs?
Just Dance obviously.
Yes who can miss that song?
I also like Poker Face.
The video is neat for that.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Has Lady Gaga come out with any new music lately?
Yes, she released an album last year.
Do you know the name of it?
It's called Joanne. That's her middle name.
That's really cool. I bet there are some amazing tracks on that album.
Definitely. She really focuses on her vocals, instead of the beats with this one.
My favorite record so far has been Million Reasons.
That song is perfect. A lot of other artists have made covers of that song.
I can't wait until she goes on tour. Will you go with me to her concert?
I would love to!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Lady Gaga's Super bowl performance this year?
I saw some of it - I wasn't that impressed, actually.
Oh really? Why?
I just expected a bit more drama and showmanship from here. She's quite campy.
Yes, she's moved on a bit though. She's more of a serious singer now.
I remember doing a few songs at a grand piano during that performance.
She has a really great voice when she uses it.
Yes, she does. She's a talented songwriter too.
People forget that it takes talent to write catchy pop songs, and Lady Gaga wrote tons of them.
Exactly - she was absolutely everywhere a few years ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Lady Gaga is our generation's Madonna?
Well, I don't know enough about Madonna to say, really. Do you think so?
Yes, I think she is our generations Madonna.
Why's that?
She's changed looks, she is a dynamic performer, she writes songs that show artistry and controversy.
I've seen her dress in some really bizarre stuff that I'm not sure Madonna had ever dressed in. I was thinking she was a bit more artsy than Madonna.
That might be true.
But point taken, she's a popular, creative, and dynamic women musician/performer who retains an independent streak.
Yes, and she's big enough to play the Super Bowl Halftime Show.
That's a pretty significant gig. I guess she's way more popular than I realize.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hello
What are you doing
I am just observing some stuff on old videos
What are you observing
Well when GaGa went to get her award for her music and she was wearing that meat dress
I bet that smelled horrible
Well i would hope it was not old meat
Even so it would feel icky and gross
Yeah that part is right
XXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga?
I absolutely love Lady Gaga!
Me too. When she first came out, I didn't think she was that good though.
I know. I always thought her songs were catchy, but I didn't realize she had as much talent until more recently.
When I first realized she could really sing was during her Sound of Music medley as a tribute to Julie Andrews.
Yes! It is the same for me. Even though I'd heard her to jazz with Tony Bennett, it was that performance that had me hooked.
Then two years ago she was amazing during the Star Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl and this year she put on a great half time show.
I know. I thought she was exceptional.
I'm really hoping to see her on her upcoming Joanne tour.
I have my tickets and I can't wait to go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could only listen to one Lady Gaga song for the rest of time, what would it be?
Bad Romance. It's got a very catchy beat.
The lyrics of Bad Romance are fun too.
Her songs are fun in general, but there's something about Bad Romance I just want to dance to whenever I hear it.
Did you know she is the first artist to have two songs pass 7 million downloads?
Wow, that is amazing. What songs?
Poker Face and Just Dance.
Those are great songs. I love Poker Face.
Have you heard The Cure?
That's her most recent single. I didn't like it as much as some others, but it's still pretty good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's music?
Of course!
What album do you like the best?
I like artpop.
I like that too. What songs do you like on that?
I love the song Do What You Want.
That is a great song. Listen to the remix of that also!
Oh I will check it out. Isn't Christina in that?
Yeah and they sound amazing.
I will go and buy it as soon as possible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Lady gaga song speaks to you the most.
Alejandro because of my family.
Which Lady Gaga look do you love the most?
I love her look in the Poker Face video.
Which Lady Gaga song do you know all of the lyrics to?
I can sing Born This way by heart.
What do you think of Lady Gaga's song Edge of Glory?
It's my theme song.  It makes me feel empowered.
Do you think Lady Gaga's song Bad Romance is relatable?
Yes, it reminds me of a certain period in my life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Alright, So here is a serious question. What do you think of Laday Gaga's music?
Her early work was weird as hell.
Really? You think so?
Absolutely! Don't get me wrong some of her music was entertaining but a large portion was just odd.
Oh yeah? What song stood out to you as weird?
I think bad romance was pretty stange. The thing that bugged me about it was that everyone would constantly sing it.
So you didn't like the song at all?
No, it's one of those annoying songs that are designed to get stuck in your head until you like it.
That's silly,
Oh yeah? Then why do so many people say they didn't like the song but it just grew on them?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will Gaga ever top Bad Romance?
I though she would, I loved Judas and Born This Way
Me too but then she went and did all that jazz stuff
Yes and her latest solo album was really slow and acoustic
No dance music at all
Maybe she's sick of it or never liked it
I saw her at Coachella and she performed the old songs really well
That's nice, maybe she'll go back to her roots
I hope so
Me too but Million Reasons was sort of catchy
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite music video by Lady Gaga?
I have two favorites Bad Romance and Telephone. How about you?
My favorite is Poker Face. She was so pretty in that one.
I thought her nose looked weird in that video. She looks hotter in the Bad Romance video.
I loved her sparkling outfit in that video.
I liked her in that red outfit. I also like her eyes in that video.
Oh her eyes where very pretty in Bad Romance.
I wonder what make-up she uses?
She probably has her own brand of make-up.
Maybe but either way she is very pretty in all her videos.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you know the singer Lady Gaga?
Of course, you think I've been living under a rock?
Ha, no. I was just wondering what she's been up to lately.
Yeah, I hear you. I haven't heard a new song in a while.
With the state of music today, I wonder if she would even put anything new out.
Why do you say that?
Well, every year seems to bring a new sound, and any artist that isn't new for that year sounds too old for the young kids to relate to.
It didn't used to be like that. I liked artists of any age group as long as they sounded good.
Yeah, that's too bad. It makes every artist sound the same, and then they disappear and new ones come. Every new artist is now a "one-hit-wonder".
Believe it. See you around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga ever do a Christmas album.
Yes she has.
She's catholic I think.
Yes she is.
I don't think there is a lot of songs on it though.
Yea it's pretty short.
White Christmas is on it.
Good old bing Crosby.
She did the song justice.
She usually does
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did Lady Gaga get her name?
I think from a QUEEN song.
Yes, I think from RADIO GAGA.
What is her nick name?
She has many.
I think one is Gagaloo.
Another nick name is RABBIT TEETH.
I think another is LITTLE MERMAID.
I am a LITTLE MONSTER.
That is a good fan name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any Lady Gaga albums?
Just her first one, but I have the double CD version.
I have all of them.
I'm not the biggest fan of hers. I feel like she needs too much attention.
I see why you say that. She does put herself out there.
Like wearing dresses made of meat.
Right, and she's done other similar things. I like some of her songs, though.
I like some on that first album.
It is her best album.
My favorite song on it is Just Dance. It's fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Lady Gaga?
I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, but I do like some of her songs.
What songs do you like?
Poker Face and Paparazzi.
Yea, those ones are really catchy.
Yea I don't listen to her enough to know of any of her less popular songs.
Yea same. All the songs I know from her are ones I've heard on the radio.
I will say though, after watching her halftime performance at the Super Bowl this year, I gained so much for respect for her.
Yea, like her singing was on point. I was surprised how good she sounded live.
Exactly. Sometimes you hear an artist on the radio and then you hear them live and it's such a disappointment.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gaga's superbowl show?
The show was good
What did you like about it
Well, the entrance, but...
but what?
the music isn't my style
I guess we don't always have to agree
That would be too crazy
I agree
Glad we can!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Lady Gaga's most recent album?
Aside from Perfect Illusion, it had too many ballads.
Really? I thought you liked the ballads, especially A Million Reasons.
No, that song makes me cringe.
Well then you must have a really good Poker Face.
That was funny. I prefer her older stuff more.
When you say older stuff, are you referring to Born This Way or all the way back to The Fame?
Definitely the The Fame. Just Dance is such a good song.
Yeah, although my favorite song from that Album is LoveGame.
I must have listened to that song and Paparazzi 1,000 times during the summer of 2009.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to lady gaga?
Yes i love her music
She is an inspiration
Shes so independent and free
Yes she is
And her outfits are so crazy
Exactly
But she has a great voice
Yes she does
I love her music
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's newer music or her greatest hits?
I haven't heard her newest stuff, so I guess I like her greatest hits best.
So which is your favorite song of hers?
Just Dance.
Yeah, me too.
That was my jam back when we would go out dancing in college.
I remember they would play it like 2 or 3 times a night.
Yeah, eventually I got burnt out on it, but now I like hearing it every once in a while.
Does it still make you get up and dance?
Yeah, her voice and the driving rhythm still get me up and dancing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Born This Way?
You mean The Lady Gaga song?
Yes that would be the one.
I think it's great that it's so positive towards The LGBTQ community.
I agree, they could use a positive message.
Absolutely, I certainly like it as a song better than Poker Face.
See I prefer Poker Face.
Why exactly do you prefer that one?
I simply like the chorus and the beat better.
Fair enough, she's really talented.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I never realized how talented Lady Gaga.
I am a big fan.  I don't think people realize her talent.
I think I wrote her off when I heard songs like "Poker Face".  It made me think that she was just another pop star.
What made you change your mind?
Well, when I saw her performance at the Superbowl, I was intrigued.  Then, I looked up some of her live performances and I was hooked.
She is a great musician.  She can sing, play the guitar, and the piano.
I just finished listening to her last album Joanne.  Some of her songs made me think of David Bowie.
Which song?  Was it "Another Day"?
That is the one!  It's just a nice song to listen to.
She was definitely influenced by some artists from the classic rock era.  I could definitely see Bowie doing a song like that in the early part of his career.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Lady Gaga at the Supoerbowl at haltime?
No, I did not get to see it.
Yeah, she was phenomenal.
What is your favor song of hers?
I like Just Dance quite a bit, it's great for dancing.
Yes, it really is. Her songs are so strong.
Are you going to her concert soon?
Maybe we should go together?
Sure, what time do you want me to pick you up?
How about that Saturday at 5pm?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Lady Gaga was a songwriter and a performer?
Yes! I heard that she used to write songs for other people before she became a star herself.
She is so talented. I am impressed by both her singing and her dancing.
Have you heard her new album yet?
I have! It has a very different style than her last record.
That's true. But I still love. What is your favorite song on the record?
I think that A-Yo is my favorite. It's so fun.
That's a good pick. But that's not my favorite.
What is your favorite?
I love Million Reasons. It is such a beautiful song. That one is my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady gaga is one of my favorite people to work out to. I love the beat in some of her songs.
What is your favorite song to work out to?
I love to run to a loop of Just Dance and Edge of Glory.
Edge of Glory is very dramatic. I love the changes in it.
I used to love Paparazzi but have grown more fond of some of her other tunes. I think I played it too much.
That can happen when you use the tunes to work out to. Her songs are very motivating for me.
What do you think of her duets with Tony Bennett. I kind of like them.
I do like them. I do not play them as much as her other tunes.
I don't either but they make for good background music if you are having people over for dinner.
I can see that. Her other music is great for a dance party.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think it's cool that you're a Lady Gaga fan too. You know, when I first saw her I dismissed her as a gimmick act, but the more I see her, the more impressed I am.
Oh I love her. She's so talented.  Did you see her performance at the Oscars? Was that unexpected or what?
Yes!  Who knew she had that range.  Obviously she's had classical training.
Not really my favorite performance, but she got to show another side and how talented she is.
Did you see the interview she did with Barbara Walters? It was her and her mother at home?  She was so real.
No, I missed that, but I bet it's on Youtube... I'll give it a look.
I have to be careful of I get Poker Face playing on a loop in my head LOL...My, my, my poker face...my, my, poker face. LOL. Definitely my favorite...today anyway haha.
You're funny.  Did you know she wrote that? She writes her own songs.  Very few entertainers can say that...she's a pianist too.
Yes, Gaga's a total performer for sure...next she'll conquer Hollywood. You know with those stage performances that she can act.
She's a total talent package for sure. Lady G is going to be with us for a long, long time and I can't wait to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any of Lady Gaga's new album?
I've heard a couple of the singles - 'Million Reasons' and 'The Cure'.
It's okay. I'm disappointed, to be honest.
Oh really? Why?
It just isn't as catchy and poppy as I expected from Lady Gaga.
She did a whole swing album, didn't she?
Yes, with Tony Bennett. She's really branching out.
She seemed kind of the same as always at the Super Bowl performance.
She only performed the big hits, most of which are quite old.
She was so huge a few years - her music was EVERYWHERE.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Lady Gaga?
She is alright I think.
Do you like any of her songs?
I like the one called Alejandro, do you?
I do. And Bad Romance too.
I have heard some of her older stuff, like Telphone.
That was on The Fame Monster Album.
I think she was better then.
I think she is better now, she has grown a lot.
Her older stuff was better for dancing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of lady Gaga
I'm not sure who that is
She's a pretty famous American musician
Oh what does she sing
Bad romance is one of her hits
That sounds somewhat familiar
She also did the Superbowl halftime show this year
I don't watch football
She guest starred on American horror show
I love that show
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Lady Gaga song is your favorite?
My favorite would have to be her new song, 100 million reasons.
Really? Why do you like that song so much?
It is such a soulful song that really conveys her emotions. Also, you can really see her artistic talent.
Yeah, I like that song, but I really prefer her early stuff like Bad Romance.
Why do you prefer that song?
It is so much more fun to dance to and it gets stuck in your head.
That's true, but 100 million reasons is much easier on the ears.
True, but you've got to admit that Bad Romance is a guilty pleasure of yours.
Yeah, you'd be right about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever listened to lady gagas album the remix.
Yes,I like it.
It's got a lot of songs on it.
Yes,17 I think.
I remember a few off it.
Yea,me too. Poker face is good.
Yes,and I like paparazzi too.
Good tune and how about boys Boys boys.
I like telephone from it too.
All good songs
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thing about Lady Gaga's music?
The activism.
What does that mean?
I think she writes songs with the purpose of improving the world.
How does she do that?
I'm not sure. She has a gift.
Can you give me an example?
Yes, the "Born This Way" album is all about the celebration of diversity.
Wow, that's interesting.
Yes, it is. But, it's just a small example. Much of Lady Gaga's music has a positive message.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of lady gaga
Yes i like her too
I love her born this way song
Thats a really good one
Yes it sends such a good message
It really does
Thisnworld needed a song like that
Exactly too much hate in the world
People need to be reminded that other people are important
Exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do,you like lady gagas artpop?
It's not bad.
Maybe not her best.
Still a good album though.
I like the songs Venus and manicure from it.
How about the title cut,artpop!
Very good tune.
Swine was good too.
Going to name,the whole album soon.
I know. Better album than I thought
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the music of Lady Gaga?
I kind of do, but she is a bit on the wild side for my taste.
I agree, the shows and her stage presence, and even publicity stunts do seem a bit wild.  But she has so many great songs!
I never thought much about it.  What songs are you talking about?
Well, she has a lot of big hits, but one of my favorite songs she does is "You and I"
I didn't know she did that song.  It's more of a rock ballad type song.  I really do like it when it comes up on the radio!
She has so many hits, like "Poker Face"  "Bad Romance" and "Born This Way"
Oh wow, that music video for Born This Way is kinda scary and weird.  But the song is good
I think that song, "Born This Way"  is her most powerful song with a message.  Although, most of her songs have a message of some sort.
That
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga doing big band standards with Tony Bennett?
I think their team up was amazing!
Me too. Did you see them perform on the Grammys last year?
I did. They did Cheek to Cheek together, and they brought the house down.
Lady Gaga is awesome, the way she can do so many styles of singing.
She brought a lot of modern energy to the song, while at the same time blending in with the traditional icon Tony Bennett.
They got a standing O at the end. It was great.
They actually won the Grammy for traditional pop album, and it was well deserved.
Whoever thought of teaming these two up needs a big raise. It was unexpected and brilliant.
I think it would be really cool if more contemporary singers would experiment with older treasures in the business. Look at the magic they can create.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lady Gaga's music?
Yes, I am a big fan of hers.
Have you listened to any of her Christmas music?
I heard some of hers on the radio.
Her album that came out in 2011, a Very Gaga Holiday, was beautiful.
She has an amazing voice.  What are your favorites on that record?
White Christmas, Orange Colored Sky and You and I are the best on it.
Who produced it?
Interscope Records produced it for Lady Gaga.
I think she records a lot for them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about artpop?
i love it
really? i dont think the critics liked it that much
who cares what they think?
that is true. everybody has their opinions.
i loved dope and do what you want
do what you want was so weird....especially because it featured r kelly.
yeah, not a great choice considering his record.
but it still made for a catchy song.
it sure did
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever listened to the Fame Kingdom?
Yes, that is a great album by Lady Gaga.
Yes, I think it was produced in 2008.
What are your favorite songs on that album?
Just Dance and Welcome to the Fame Kingdom are my favorite songs.
Those are fantastic songs. I am sure she has won awards on that album.
It had Love Game and Pokerface on it as well.
Pokerface is a big hit in all the dance places.
Yes, it's quite popular.
Youtube gets hits all the time on that song.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Like a live show?

No I never have.  Have you?
No I haven't, but I've heard they are incredible.
I bet it would be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga's music?
I didn't like her old music but I like her new music.
I'm the opposite, I like her old music better.
It was just way to poppy for me.
Yes a lot of the focus was on the sound rather than her voice but that was good about it.
I like her voice and that's what I want to hear not a bunch of beats.
I noticed her newest album had more vocals.
Yes and now I can enjoy listening to her.
She is very versatile with her music.
I agree she has lots of styles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder what she plans to do next
Who
Lady gaga
