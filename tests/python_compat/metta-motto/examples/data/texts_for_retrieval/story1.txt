TWICE TOLD TALES

THE LILY'S QUEST

By Nathaniel Hawthorne

What a contrast between the young pilgrims of bliss and their unbidden associate !

But the three had not gone far , when they reached a spot that pleased the gentle Lily , and she paused.

" What sweeter place shall we find than this ? " said she.

" Why should we seek farther for the site of our Temple ? "

There were vistas and pathways leading onward and onward into the green woodlands , and vanishing away in the glimmering shade.

" Yes , " said Adam Forrester , " we might seek all day , and find no lovelier spot.

We will build our Temple here. "

" Not here ! " cried old Walter Gascoigne.

" Here , long ago , other mortals built their Temple of Happiness.

Seek another site for yours ! "

" What ! " exclaimed Lilias Fay.

" Have any ever planned such a Temple , save ourselves ? "

" Poor child ! " said her gloomy kinsman.

" In one shape or other , every mortal has dreamed your dream. "

Under this type , Adam Forrester and Lilias saw that the old man spake of Sorrow.

" This is very sad , " said the Lily ; sighing.

" Well , there are lovelier spots than this , " said Adam Forrester , soothingly , " spots which sorrow has not blighted. "

" This glen was made on purpose for our Temple ! "

" And the glad song of the brook will be always in our ears , " said Lilias Fay.

" And its long melody shall sing the bliss of our lifetime , " said Adam Forrester.

" Ye must build no Temple here ! " murmured their dismal companion.

And , alas ! there had been woe , nor that alone.

And ever since , the victim's death-shrieks were often heard to echo between the cliffs.

" And see ! " cried old Gascoigne , " is the stream yet pure from the stain of the murderer's hands ? "

" Come , then , " said Adam Forrester , as cheerily as he could ; " we shall soon find a happier spot. "

They set forth again , young Pilgrims on that quest which millions which every child of Earth has tried in turn.

And were the Lily and her lover to be more fortunate than all those millions ?

For a long time , it seemed not so.

" Where in this world , " exclaimed Adam Forrester , despondingly , " shall we build our Temple of Happiness ? "

In due time it was finished , and a day appointed for a simple rite of dedication.

With his farewell glance , a shadow had fallen over the portal , and Lilias was invisible.

But , alas for the Temple of Happiness !

And to ! a wonder !

Among those forgotten ancestors was the Lily to be laid.

He watched the mourners as they lowered the coffin down.
