TWICE TOLD TALES

SNOW-FLAKES

By Nathaniel Hawthorne

It is to be , in good earnest , a wintry storm.

The cloud-spirits are slowly weaving her white mantle.

Thus gradually , by silent and stealthy influences , are great changes wrought.

We , likewise , shall lose sight of our mother's familiar visage , and must content ourselves with looking heavenward the oftener.

Now , leaving the storm to do his appointed office , let us sit down , pen in hand , by our fireside.

In our brief summer , I do not think , but only exist in the vague enjoyment of a dream.

However transitory their glow , they at least shine amid the darksome shadow which the clouds of the outward sky fling through the room.

Now look we forth again , and see how much of his task the storm-spirit has done.

Slow and sure !

He has the day , perchance the week , before him , and may take his own time to accomplish Nature's burial in snow.

Very sad are the flower shrubs in midwinter !

The roofs of the houses are now all white , save where the eddying wind has kept them bare at the bleak corners.

Look next into the street , where we have seen an amusing parallel to the combat of those fancied demons in the upper regions.

It is a snow-battle of school-boys.

What pitched battles , worthy to be chanted in Homeric strains !

What storming of fortresses , built all of massive snowblocks !

What feats of individual prowess , and embodied onsets of martial enthusiasm !

Who reared it ?

And what means it ? "

The shattered pedestal of many a battle monument has provoked these questions , when none could answer.

Would it might inspire me to sketch out the personification of a New England winter !

And that idea , if I can seize the snow-wreathed figures that flit before my fancy , shall be the theme of the next page.

How does Winter herald his approach ?

It is stern Winter's vesture.

It is the voice of Winter ; and when parents and children bear it , they shudder and exclaim , " Winter is come !

Cold Winter has begun his reign already ! "

There he lies stark and stiff , a human shape of ice , on the spot where Winter overtook him.

On strides the tyrant over the rushing rivers and broad lakes , which turn to rock beneath his footsteps.

His dreary empire is established ; all around stretches the desolation of the Pole.

Such fantasies , intermixed among graver toils of mind , have made the winter's day pass pleasantly.

On the window-sill , there is a layer of snow , reaching half-way up the lowest pane of glass.

The garden is one unbroken bed.

Next comes a sledge , laden with wood for some unthrifty housekeeper , whom winter has surprised at a cold hearth.

But what dismal equipage now struggles along the uneven street ?

A sable hearse , bestrewn with snow , is bearing a dead man through the storm to his frozen bed.

O , how dreary is a burial in winter , when the bosom of Mother Earth has no warmth for her poor child !

Alas !

I shiver , and think it time to be disconsolate.

Whence come they ?

Where do they build their nests , and seek their food ?

I know not whence they come , nor why ; yet my spirit has been cheered by that wandering flock of snow-birds.
