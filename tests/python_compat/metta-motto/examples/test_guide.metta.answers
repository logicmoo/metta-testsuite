["user Tweak this proverb to apply to model instructions instead.
 Where there is no guidance, a people falls,
but in an abundance of counselors there is safety. 
- Proverbs 11 : 14 
UPDATED
 Where there is no guidance in model instructions, a project fails,
but with an abundance of expert advice, success prevails.
